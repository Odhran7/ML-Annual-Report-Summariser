business strategy developments 

our primary focus continues to be on gross margin and operating margin expansion while at the same time achieving revenue growth in our focused endmarkets of automotive industrial and communications infrastructure as well as being opportunistic in other endmarkets including obtaining longerterm supply arrangements with strategic endcustomers we are also focused on achieving efficiencies in our operating expenditures while we believe we have made significant progress on gross margin and operating margin expansion we continue to rationalize our product portfolio and have allocated capital research and development investments and resources to accelerate growth in highmargin products and endmarkets by moving away from nondifferentiated products which have had historically lower gross margins to this effect onsemi is exploring the sale of select manufacturing facilities as actions are initiated to achieve our business strategy goals we could incur accounting charges in the future 

we believe these actions among others will allow us to transition to a lighter internal fabrication model where our financial performance will be less volatile and not as heavily influenced by our internal manufacturing volumes we will continue to rationalize our manufacturing footprint in 2022 to align with our investment priorities and corporate strategy our goal is to reduce volatility in our gross margins and maximize return on our manufacturing investments with the intention of having our product strategy drive our manufacturing footprint and capital investments 

in order to streamline our operations and achieve efficiencies we implemented an involuntary severance plan during 2021 under which approximately 960 employees were notified of their employment termination and we incurred severance and related charges of 653 million we continue to evaluate employee positions and locations for potential efficiencies and may incur additional severance and related charges in the future 

we are focused on sustainability as we drive a common theme across all markets in august 2020 onsemi announced its commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2040 as we initiate steps to achieve our sustainability goals additional investments may be required in the future in connection with such actions although the timing and amounts of such investments are uncertain at this time 

completed and pending acquisitions and divestitures 

on october 28 2021 we completed our acquisition of gt advanced technologies inc gtat a producer of sic pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement and plan of merger the purchase price for the acquisition was 4349 million which included cash consideration of 4246 million and effective settlement of preacquisition balances noncash of approximately 10 million in exchange for all of the outstanding equity interests of gtat we believe the gtat acquisition will act as a building block to fuel growth and accelerate innovation in disruptive intelligent power technologies and secure supply of sic to meet rapidly growing customer demand for sicbased solutions in the sustainable ecosystem

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

the manufacturing and other operations required to produce our products are highly dependent on the efficient operation of numerous processes including processes contingent upon third party component manufacturers and other service providers and processes among our various internal facilities and any disruption in these processes could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce many of our products at all or at competitive prices which could in turn materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our manufacturing network includes multiple owned and thirdparty facilities which may each produce one or more components necessary for the assembly of a single product as a result of this interdependence an operational disruption at a facility may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products in the event of a disruption at any such facility we may be unable to effectively source replacement components on acceptable terms from qualified third parties in which case our ability to produce many of our products could be materially disrupted or delayed conversely some of our facilities are single source facilities that only produce one of our endproducts and a disruption at any such facility would materially delay or cease production of the related product in the event of any such operational disruption we may experience difficulty in beginning production of replacement components or products at new facilities or transferring production to other existing facilities any of which could result in a loss of future revenues and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in addition for certain manufacturing activities and for the supply of raw materials we utilize thirdparty contractors our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to commit to purchase services based on forecasted product needs which may be inaccurate and in some cases require longerterm commitments we are also dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized thirdparty suppliers for required components and materials for certain of our key technologies arranging for replacement manufacturers and suppliers can be timeconsuming and costly and the number of qualified alternative providers can be extremely limited our business operations productivity and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasted needs proved to be materially incorrect generally our agreements with suppliers of raw materials impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources shortages could occur in various essential raw materials and if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner the costs of our raw materials increases significantly their quality deteriorates or they give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our manufacturing efficiency is contingent upon the operations of these interdependent processes and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this manufacturing efficiency increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or be successful in our manufacturing 

rationalization plans if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing facilities testing facilities and external manufacturers at expected or minimum purchase obligation levels or if production capacity increases while revenue does not the fixed costs and other operating expenses associated with these facilities and arrangements will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business has been and is expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic in addition to global macroeconomic effects the covid19 pandemic and related adverse public health developments have been causing and are expected to continue to cause disruption to our domestic and international operations and sales activities in addition we and our suppliers thirdparty distributors subcontractors and customers have been and are expected to continue to be disrupted by worker absenteeism quarantines and restrictions on certain of our employees’ ability to perform their jobs office and factory closures or restrictions labor shortages disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure border closures or other travel or healthrelated restrictions depending on the magnitude of such effects on our manufacturing activities or the operations of our suppliers thirdparty distributors or subcontractors our supply chain manufacturing and product shipments could be delayed which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition any economic downturn or recession brought on by the covid19 pandemic or other disease outbreaks could adversely affect demand for our products and impact our results of operations and financial condition these effects alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations legal exposure or financial condition the extent of the covid19 pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration spread and intensity of the pandemic including resurgences in certain geographic areas as a result of new strains and variants such as delta and omicron the efficacy of vaccines the speed of vaccine rollouts and the effect of vaccine mandates if any on our employees all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict while we are not able at this time to estimate the longterm effect of these factors on our business the adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows has been and could continue to be material 

we may be unable to implement certain business strategies which may include exiting certain facilities product lines or businesses or restructuring our operations and any issue with the pursuit of such business strategy developments could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may from time to time determine to implement business strategies and restructuring initiatives in order to remain competitive because our strategies and restructuring activities may involve changes to many aspects of our business including the location of our production facilities and personnel and the potential exit of certain product lines and businesses our ability to successfully do so depends on a number of factors many of which are outside of our control if we are not able to effectively manage or efficiently implement these strategies andor restructuring initiatives for reasons within or outside of our control then our business operations could be materially adversely affected 

in addition implementation of a business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations for example following the announcement of our commitment to achieving carbon neutral emissions by 2040 we may take actions to pursue our goal of generating netzero emissions that may result in material expenditures that could impact our financial condition or results of operations andor could disrupt our existing operations in addition the failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions or strategies could have a material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition or results of operations in addition even if we fully execute and implement these activities there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position to the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other anticipated benefits of strategy or restructuring initiatives our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

if we are unable to identify and make the substantial research and development investments or develop new products required to satisfy customer demands as required to remain competitive in our business our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market enhanced technologies and products the development of new products is complex and timeconsuming often requiring significant capital investment and lead time for development and testing we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development required to remain competitive in addition the lengthy development cycle for certain of our products could limit our ability to adapt quickly to changes affecting the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and we may be unable to develop innovative responses to our 

customers’ and endusers’ evolving needs on the timelines they require or at all there can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes known as design wins for new products in addition design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments realize a return on the capital expended or achieve expected gross margins as expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured to the extent that we underinvest in our research and development efforts fail to recognize the need for innovation with respect to our products or that our investments and capital expenditures in research and development do not lead to sales of new products we may be unable to bring to market technologies and products attractive to customers and so our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies innovation short product life cycles evolving regulatory and industry standards and certifications changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions products are frequently replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes and as demand for older technology falls the price at which such products can be sold drops if we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our production efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of older products in certain limited cases we may not be able to cease production of older products either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products for a sustained period of time if reductions in our production costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for products we sell our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our new product development efforts fail to align with the needs of our customers our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has experienced rapid consolidation and if we are unable to compete effectively or identify attractive opportunities for consolidation it could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

if we are unable to compete effectively our competitive position could be weakened relative to our peers which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations products or technologies developed by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive we also may be unable to market and sell our products if they are not competitive on the basis of price quality technical performance features system compatibility customized design innovation availability delivery timing and reliability if we fail to compete effectively on developing strategic relationships with customers and customer sales and technical support our sales and revenue may be materially adversely affected competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise prices and any inability to maintain revenue or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a significant adverse effect on our gross margin reduced sales and lower gross margins would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us and we may be at a competitive disadvantage if we fail to identify attractive opportunities to acquire companies to expand our business consolidation among competitors and integration among customers could erode our market share impair our capacity to compete and require us to restructure operations any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the automotive industry a downturn or lower sales to customers in the industry could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

a significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive industry sales into this industry represented approximately 34 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 the automotive industry is cyclical and as a result our customers in the industry are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions disruptive innovation and endmarket preferences which can adversely affect sales of our products and correspondingly our results of operations additionally the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in the industry could decline despite continued growth in its respective end markets lower sales to customers in the automotive industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations further to the extent we have longterm supply agreements with our customers which includes fixed pricing we could be subject to fluctuating manufacturing costs that could negatively impact our profitability additionally under our longterm supply agreements we could incur certain obligations if we are not able to fulfill our commitments 

our operating results depend in part on the performance of independent distributors 

a portion of our sales occurs through global and regional distributors that are not under our control we rely on distributors to grow and develop their customer base and anticipate customer needs and any lack of such actions by our distributors may adversely affect our results of operations these independent distributors also generally represent product lines offered by several companies and are not subject to any minimum sales requirements or obligation to market our products to their customers in turn distributors could reduce their sales efforts for our products or choose to terminate their representation of us additionally we rely on our distributors to provide accurate and timely sales reports in order for us to be able to generate financial reports that accurately represent distributor sales of our products during any given period any inaccuracies or untimely reports could adversely affect our ability to produce accurate and timely financial reports and recognize revenue 

changes in and the regulatory implementation of tariffs or other government trade policies could reduce demand for our products limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions as a result of international trade disputes or changes in trade policies may adversely affect our sales and profitability for example additional tariffs and the related geopolitical uncertainty between the united states and china and other countries may cause decreased end market demand for our products from distributors and other customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition tariffs on components that we import from certain nations that have imposed or may in the future impose tariffs may adversely affect our profitability unless we are able to exclude such components from the tariffs or we raise prices for our products which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors to the extent that our sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our international sales and purchases are subject to numerous united states and foreign laws and regulations related to import and export matters for example licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries under applicable export control regulations including the provisions of the us export administration act a determination by the us government or any foreign government that we have failed to comply with trade or export regulations can result in penalties including fines administrative civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities seizure of products or in the extreme case denial of export privileges or suspension or debarment from government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our sales business and results of operations 

we may be unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 

our success depends on our ability to attract motivate and retain highly skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel both in the us and internationally in the semiconductor industry the competition for qualified personnel particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees is intense during such periods competitors may try to recruit our most valuable technical employees additionally we have entered into employment agreements with certain senior executives but we do not have employment agreements with most of our employees many of these employees could leave our company with little or no prior notice and would be free to work for a competitor while we devote a great deal of our attention to designing competitive compensation programs aimed at attracting and retaining personnel specific elements of our compensation programs may not be competitive with those of our competitors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require if one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions we may not be able to replace them easily or at all and other senior management may be required to divert attention from other aspects of our business loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and on our business 

warranty claims product liability claims product recalls and the failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our contracts could harm our business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process requiring production in a tightly controlled clean environment minute impurities in our manufacturing materials contaminants in the manufacturing environment manufacturing equipment failures and other defects can cause our products to be noncompliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in electrical design oems are increasingly expecting 

them to warrant their products and are looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage if any and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall could have material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them and claims for consequential damages against our customers from their customers we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenue and profits we receive from the products involved in certain instances we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions or other contractual provisions but there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective to the extent we are liable for damages in excess of the revenue and profits received from the products involved our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

currency fluctuations changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sizeable sales and operations in the asiapacific region and europe and a significant amount of this business is transacted in currency other than us dollars in addition while a significant percentage of our cash is generated outside the us many of our liabilities including our outstanding indebtedness and certain other cash payments such as share repurchases are payable in the us in us dollars as a result currency fluctuations and changes in foreign exchange regulations can have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

in addition repatriation of funds held outside the us could have adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay due to required local country approvals or local obligations foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency as a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the us our financial flexibility may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations restrictions on repatriation or the inability to use cash held abroad to fund our operations in the us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

trends risks and uncertainties related to intellectual property 

if our technologies are subject to claims of infringement on the ip rights of others efforts to address such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may from time to time be subject to claims that we may be infringing the ip rights of others if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such ip rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for ip we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring such technologies further we may be subject to ip litigation which could cause us to incur significant expense materially adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome or pursuant to the terms of a settlement of any such litigation we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs indemnify customers or distributors cease the manufacture use sale or importation of infringing products expend significant resources to develop or acquire noninfringing technologies discontinue the use of processes or obtain licenses which may not be available on reasonable terms to the infringing technologies 

the outcome of ip litigation is inherently uncertain and if not resolved in our favor could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to protect the ip we have developed or licensed our competitive position business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

the enforceability of our patents trademarks copyrights software licenses and other ip is uncertain in certain circumstances effective ip protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the us and internationally the various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered ip assets patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts with respect to our ip generally we cannot assure you that 

• any of the substantial number of us or foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated circumvented challenged abandoned or licensed to others 

• any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought 

• any of the trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow or mask works that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated circumvented challenged abandoned or licensed to others 

• any of our pending or future trademark copyright or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought or 

• that we will be able to successfully enforce our ip rights in the us or foreign countries 

when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights of its own against us which may materially and adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications we seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to ip arising out of our research should we be unable to protect our ip competitors may develop products or technologies that duplicate our products or technologies benefit financially from innovations for which we bore the costs of development and undercut the sales and marketing of our products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

trends risks and uncertainties related to technology and data privacy 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could irreparably damage our reputation and our business expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we routinely collect and store sensitive data including confidential and other proprietary information about our business and our employees customers suppliers and business partners the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses illegal hacking criminal fraud or impersonation acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error our cyber security measures andor those of our thirdparty service providers andor customers may not detect or prevent such security breaches the costs to us to reduce the risk of or alleviate cyber security breaches and vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may materially impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions any such compromise of our information security could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business an interruption in our operations the unauthorized transfer of cash or other of our assets the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws in addition computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities and any such attack if successful could expose us to liability to customer claims any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the company is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future we collect personally identifiable information pii and other data as part of our business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are currently more restrictive than those in the us any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or to comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to the company or company officials including substantial monetary fines and could damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business 

trends risks and uncertainties related to regulation 

environmental and health and safety liabilities and expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations particularly those environmental regulations that control and restrict the use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process we also have operations subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other requirements regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances we have indemnities from third parties for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities for periods prior to our operations at some of our current and past sites and we have also purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance will cover any or all of our material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities including 

• changes in us and international environmental or health and safety laws or regulations including but not limited to future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns 

• the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced administered or interpreted 

• our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities 

• the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims including the cost of cleanup of currently unknown environmental conditions or 

• the cost of fines penalties or other legal liability should we fail to comply with environmental or health and safety laws or regulations 

to the extent that we face unforeseen environmental or health and safety compliance costs or remediation expenses or liabilities that are not covered by indemnities or insurance we may bear the full effect of such costs expenses and liabilities which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the fcpa our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by the us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to changes in tax legislation or have exposure to additional tax liabilities which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are therefore subject to complex income tax and transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate changes to or interpretations of tax legislation or regulations could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities in addition other factors or events such as changes to our operating structure strategy and investment decisions could also increase our future effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities 

tax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business in response to the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act and to better align our profits with our activities we implemented certain restructuring during the year ended december 31 2020 after our restructuring most of our income is taxable in the united states with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreignderived intangible income “fdii” beginning in 2026 the effective rate for fdii increases from 13 to 16 further if us rates increase andor the fdii deduction is eliminated or reduced both of which have been proposed by the current us presidential administration and congress our provision for income taxes results of operations and cash flows would be adversely potentially materially 

affected also if our customers move manufacturing operations to the united states our fdii deduction may be reduced 

further changes in tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles related to transfer pricing and continues to develop new proposals including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income these changes as adopted by countries may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes results of operations and financial condition 

social and environmental responsibility regulations policies and provisions as well as customer and investor demands may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors 

with the increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry a number of our customers have adopted or may adopt procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions in addition an increasing number of oems are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts such as in the democratic republic of congo this could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices including our products as a result we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers’ demands which may harm our sales and operating results 

more investors are also requiring companies to disclose corporate social and environmental policies practices and metrics in addition various jurisdictions are developing climate changebased laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us these legal and regulatory requirements as well as investor expectations on corporate environmental and social responsibility practices and disclosure are subject to change can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with if we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our suppliers to comply with such policies or provisions or meet the requirements of our customers and investors a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares and may take legal action against us which could harm our reputation revenue and results of operations 

trends risks and uncertainties related to our indebtedness 

our debt could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 we had 32583 million of outstanding principal relating to our indebtedness we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future to repay or refinance other outstanding debt to make acquisitions or for other purposes and if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 197 billion available for future borrowings under the revolving credit facility the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

• our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 

• the timing amount and execution of our capital allocation policy including our share repurchase program as defined below could be affected by the degree to which we are leveraged 

• a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities must be dedicated to service our debt which reduces the funds available to us for our operations and may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests 

• some of our debt are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates 

• our debt agreements may contain and any agreements to refinance our debt could continue to contain financial and restrictive covenants and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on us 

• our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to and reduce our flexibility to respond to general economic downturns and adverse industry and business conditions 

• as our longterm debt ages we must repay and may need to renegotiate such debt or seek additional financing 

• our existing debt requires substantially all of our assets to be collateralized and to the extent any future debt we incur requires collateral to secure such indebtedness our assets could be at risk and our flexibility related to such assets could be limited 

• our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the semiconductor industry 

• our ability to deduct interest expense that we may incur may be limited or deferred under us andor local tax rules including section 163j of the code and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and 

• our level of indebtedness may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors 

to the extent that we continue to maintain or expand our significant indebtedness our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the inability to meet our obligations under our amended credit agreement could materially and adversely affect us by among other things limiting our ability to conduct our operations and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

the obligations under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the personal property and material real property assets of the company’s domestic subsidiaries as a result if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the amended credit agreement the lenders could take possession of and foreclose on the pledged collateral securing the indebtedness in which case we would be at risk of losing the related collateral which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations in addition subject to customary exceptions the amended credit agreement requires mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances which may result in prepaying outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility and the term loan b facility rather than using funds for other business purposes our financing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition including among other things our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and could reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

the agreements relating to our indebtedness including the amended credit agreement and the 3875 notes may restrict our ability to operate our business and as a result may materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our debt agreements including the amended credit agreement and the 3875 notes contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to incur additional debt including issuing guarantees incur liens make certain investments settle a conversion of our 1625 notes in whole or in part with cash redeem or otherwise perform our obligations under the terms of our 3875 notes sell or otherwise dispose of assets make acquisitions engage in mergers or consolidations or certain other change of control transactions make distributions to our stockholders engage in restructuring activities engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions and issue or repurchase stock or other securities 

such agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them to the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations our financial condition may be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us to the extent that we are unable to engage in activities that support the growth profitability and competitiveness of our business our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations and any inability to repay our debt when required would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to make required payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash to satisfy our debt obligations as they come due we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect 

furthermore we cannot assure you that if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness which could materially negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition a default under our committed credit facilities including our amended credit agreement could also limit our ability to make 

further borrowings under those facilities which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to the current stockholders 

an event of default under any agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness could cross default other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if there were an event of default under certain of our agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness any such cross default would put immediate pressure on our liquidity and financial condition and would amplify the risks described above with regards to being unable to repay our indebtedness when due and payable we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our operating subsidiaries which may have no independent obligation to repay our debt are not able to make cash available to us for such repayment our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal contractual governmental or regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if interest rates increase our debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could increase significantly which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

borrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time including under our amended credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and as a result expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease while we have entered into swap agreements to reduce interest rate volatility for a portion of our term loan b facility through 2024 we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk to the extent the risk materializes and is not fully mitigated the resulting increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our amended credit agreement and our interest rate swap agreements have an interest rate tied to libo rate while certain of these agreements such as the amended credit agreement provide procedures for determining an alternative base rate in the event that libo rate is discontinued not all do so effective as of december 31 2021 the united kingdom financial conduct authority fca which regulates the libo rate no longer publishes libo rate quotations including oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings the publication of overnight and one three six and 12month us dollar libor settings will be extended through june 30 2023 further on october 21 2021 five us federal financial institution regulatory agencies in conjunction with us state bank and state credit union regulators issued a joint statement to emphasize the expectation that supervised institutions with libo rate exposure continue to progress toward an orderly transition away from libo rate in advance of the 2023 deadline and providing considerations with respect to alternative base rates and appropriate fallback language noting that failure to adequately prepare for the libo rate’s discontinuance could undermine financial stability and institutions’ safety and soundness and create litigation operational and consumer protection risks regardless there can be no assurances as to what alternative base rates may be and whether such base rates will be more or less favorable than libo rate and any other unforeseen impacts of the discontinuation of libo rate the company intends to monitor the developments with respect to the phasing out of libo rate and work with its lenders to ensure the transition away from libo rate will have minimal impact on its financial condition but can provide no assurances that the impact of the discontinuation of libo rate would not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 

the timing of the cash payments to service the 0 notes the 1625 notes and the 3875 notes is not entirely in our control and may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy these obligations in a timely manner 

as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding approximately 1551 million aggregate principal amount of our 1625 notes 7000 million aggregate principal amount of our 3875 notes and 8050 million of aggregate principal of our 0 notes collectively the outstanding notes holders of the outstanding notes have certain rights that would require us to make repurchases prior to the stated maturity for all or a portion of the amounts due in certain circumstances for example holders of the 3875 notes have the right to require us to repurchase all of their 3875 notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events accompanied by certain ratings events as described in the indenture governing the 3875 notes at a repurchase price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any accrued prior to but not including the repurchase date 

servicing the outstanding notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under such notes our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 1625 notes or the 0 notes repurchase any of the outstanding notes in the case of an applicable repurchasetriggering event under the respective indentures or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control 

further if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the 1625 notes or the 0 notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would dilute existing stockholders 

in certain circumstances a takeover of our company and similar triggering events could also trigger an option of the holders of the 1625 notes the 3875 notes and the 0 notes to require us to repurchase such notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to the holders of the 1625 notes the 3875 notes the 0 notes and our common stock which could materially decrease the value of such notes and of our common stock 

the terms of the amended credit agreement and the terms of the 3875 notes limit the amount of future indebtedness secured by liens that we may incur if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above our decision to use our cash for other purposes such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock could also intensify these risks 

the conditional conversion features of the 1625 notes and the 0 notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and if we elect to settle any amounts related to conditional conversion features in common stock any such settlement could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

if specified conditions are met holders of the 1625 notes and the 0 notes may convert their notes prior to their stated maturity in the event the conditional conversion features are triggered holders electing to convert their notes could require us to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligations through the payment of cash further we are required to settle conversions of the 0 notes in cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted and may elect to pay or deliver as the case may be cash or shares of common stock or a combination to settle the remaining amount any such cash payments could materially adversely affect our liquidity additionally when the conditional conversion features are triggered at the end of a reporting period we are required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify the outstanding principal of such notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital a conditional conversion feature under the 1625 notes has been triggered as of december 31 2021 and in certain prior quarters and we can provide no assurance as to when or whether these conditional conversion features will lapse or be triggered again in the future any material decrease in our liquidity or reduction in our net working capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may elect to settle the 1625 notes solely in common stock to avoid an event of default under our amended credit agreement and any such issuance of common stock could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders including stockholders who previously converted such notes to shares of our common stock our 0 notes require the principal of 8050 million to be paid in cash the excess value if any can be paid in a combination of cash or shares to the extent we elect to settle the excess in shares the ownership interests of existing stockholders could be materially diluted 

note hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

concurrently with the issuances of the 1625 notes and the 0 notes respectively we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions which we refer to as the option counterparties the convertible note hedges are expected to 

reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the respective series of notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes of such series as the case may be we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties with respect to the 1625 notes and the 0 notes the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds 3070 with respect to the 1625 notes and 7434 with respect to the 0 notes 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions for the 1625 notes and the 0 notes the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock andor entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of such notes the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions if realized could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we are subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral if one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions 

to the extent the option counterparties do not honor their contractual commitments with us pursuant to the note hedge transactions we could face a material increase in our exposure to potential dilution upon any conversion of the 1625 notes andor the 0 notes andor cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 1625 notes andor the 0 notes as the case may be our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock in addition upon a default by one of the option counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences with respect to our common stock any such adverse tax consequences or increased cash payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

trends risks and uncertainties related to our common stock 

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

• establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting 

• authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock which is preferred stock that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval and that could be issued with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and 

• require the approval by holders of at least 66 23 of our outstanding common stock to amend any of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders any delay or prevention of an acquisition of our company that would have been beneficial to our stockholders could materially decrease the value of our common stock 

general risk factors 

we may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in our industry require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts often in markets or regions in which we have less experience risks related to successful integration of an acquisition include but are not limited to 1 the ability to integrate information technology and other systems 2 issues not discovered in our due diligence 3 customers responding by changing their existing business relationships with us or the acquired company 4 diversion of management’s attention from our day to day operations and 5 loss of key employees postintegration in addition we may incur unexpected costs or taxes resulting from the acquisition or integration of the newly acquired business missteps or delays in integrating our acquisitions which could be caused by factors outside of our control or our failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions on the timeline we anticipate could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

depending on the level of our ownership interest in and the extent to which we can exercise control over the acquired business we may be required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and sec rules and regulations to consolidate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or statements prepared in accordance with gaap or the acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems any of which could materially impair our ability to properly integrate such businesses into our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis any revisions to inaccuracies in or restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to accounting for our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations 

downturns or volatility in general economic conditions as well as general macroeconomic trends and impacts could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

historically worldwide semiconductor industry sales have tracked the impacts of financial crises subsequent recoveries and persistent economic uncertainty we believe our business today is driven more by secular growth drivers and not solely by macroeconomic and industry cyclicality as was the case historically yet we could experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions and volatile or uncertain economic conditions can adversely impact our sales and profitability and make it difficult for us and our competitors to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 

in addition to general economic conditions impacts of other macroeconomic events such as the covid19 pandemic climate change and other natural disasters could materially adversely impact our operations by causing disruptions in the geographies in which we and our suppliers third party distributors and subcontractors operate if any of these events impact our supply chain manufacturing and product shipments could be delayed which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition disruption of transportation and distribution systems could result in reduced operational efficiency and customer service interruption such events can negatively impact revenue and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow 

regulatory and legislative developments related to climate change may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

various jurisdictions are developing climate changebased laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us these legal and regulatory requirements as well as heightened investor expectations on corporate environmental and social responsibility practices and disclosure are subject to change can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing if we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our suppliers to comply with such policies or provisions or meet the requirements of our customers and investors a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares and may take legal action against us which could harm our reputation revenue and results of operations any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete furthermore increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or others in our industry could harm our reputation any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition

executive overview 

this executive overview presents summarized information regarding our business and operating trends only for further information relating to the information summarized herein see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in its entirety 

onsemi results 

our revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 was 67398 million an increase of 283 from 52550 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was attributable to the improving economic conditions and an exceptionally strong market for semiconductor products resulting in a significant increase in demand across psg asg and isg during 2021 we reported net income attributable to onsemi of 10096 million compared to 2342 million in 2020 our operating income totaled 12876 million during 2021 compared to 3487 million during 2020 the increase in operating income and net income attributable to onsemi was due to significantly better gross margins from higher sales volume favorable mix increase in average selling prices better utilization in factories and savings from restructuring activities our gross margin increased by approximately 760 basis points to 403 in 2021 from 327 in 2020 see discussion under results of operations for additional discussion on the reasons for the fluctuations year over year 

business and macroeconomic environment 

the covid19 pandemic has had and continues to have a significant impact around the world prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including restrictions on travel business operations and temporary closures of facilities however during 2021 economic conditions began to improve and business conditions became stronger during the second half of the year during 2021 we achieved revenue growth in our focused endmarkets of automotive industrial and communications infrastructure as well as expand our gross margin and operating margin as a result of costsaving initiatives product rationalization favorable mix and price increases among other actions while the semiconductor industry conditions have resulted in increased costs throughout our supply chain we have been able to pass a majority of such increases to our customers which also contributed to higher revenue for 2021 we expect to continue to pursue costsaving initiatives to be able to align our overall cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our expected revenue spending and capacity levels to help offset increased costs we have taken and continue to take significant cost containment efforts including but 

not limited to workforce reductions and reducing discretionary spending 

the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company’s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the company’s control including the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the emergence of new variants the development availability distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments the imposition of protective public safety measures and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for products while all our global manufacturing sites are currently operational our facilities could be required to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates due to the covid19 pandemic there can be no assurances that we will adequately forecast the magnitude or duration of the adverse economic conditions on our business or that we will effectively align our cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our revenue spending and capacity levels in the future

we recorded an income tax provision of 1466 million and a benefit of 598 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2021 consisted primarily of 1794 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations 36 million related to a discrete foreign tax rate change 29 million related to return to provision adjustments and 34 million related to additional valuation allowance partially offset by discrete benefits of 243 million relating to the release of uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions for favorable audit results and lapse of statue 69 million relating to net equity award windfalls and 115 million primarily relating to an increase in deferred tax assets expected to be realized in the foreseeable future due to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary 

the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2020 consisted of discrete benefits of 630 million primarily due to the recognition of certain deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities related to the domestication of certain foreign subsidiaries and a benefit of 494 million related to the release of valuation allowance against certain state deferred tax assets these benefits were partially offset by a provision of 439 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations a 23 million discrete provision relating to prior year uncertain tax positions a discrete provision of 55 million relating to additional foreign valuation allowance and 09 million of other discrete items

liquidity and capital resources 

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements contingencies sources and uses of cash operations working capital and longterm assets and liabilities 

contingencies 

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses including but not limited to losses due to ip infringement environmental contamination and other property damage personal injury our failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or our breach of representations warranties or covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in economic damage bodily injury or property damage in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities including certain liabilities under the exchange act that might be incurred by any director or officer in his or her capacity as such 

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

see note 13 commitments and contingencies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for possible contingencies related to legal matters see also business—government regulation for information on certain environmental matters 

sources and uses of cash 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 13526 million as of december 31 2021 we require cash to i fund our operating expenses working capital requirements outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments ii service our debt including principal and interest iii conduct research and development iv incur capital expenditures and v repurchase our common stock as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities on a regular basis during 2021 we completed the acquisition of gtat see note 5 acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

• changes in demand for our products including as a result of the covid19 pandemic competitive pricing pressures supply chain constraints effective management of our manufacturing capacity our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses our ability to make progress on the achievement of our business strategy and sustainability goals the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business 

• our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise including interest rate fluctuations macroeconomic conditions sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time 

the following are some of the significant sources and uses of cash during 2021 outside of our operating activities and regular capital expenditures 

• issuance of 8050 million aggregate principal amount of 0 convertible senior notes due 2027 the net proceeds of which were used to repurchase 3724 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 1625 notes for a total consideration of 5065 million in cash and 54 million shares of the companys common stock 

• payment of 1603 million for convertible note hedges and receipt of 938 million for the sale of warrants both in relation to the issuance of the 0 notes 

• repayment of the outstanding balance of 7000 million under the revolving credit facility 

• repurchase of 474 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 1625 notes for 474 million in cash and 16 million shares of the companys common stock 

• acquisition of gtat for 4246 million in cash 

• net purchases of availableforsale securities for 447 million 

our ability to service our longterm debt including our 0 notes 3875 notes 1625 notes the revolving credit facility and the term loan b facility to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance and the timing of the full economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic as well as to financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longerterm objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating debt repayment and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next 12 months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

during the ordinary course of business we evaluate our cash requirements and if necessary adjust our expenditures for inventory operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand our capital expenditures are primarily directed towards manufacturing equipment and can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives our capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives for example during 2021 we paid approximately 4446 million for capital expenditures while in 2020 we paid approximately 3836 million while our capital expenditures have historically been approximately 6 to 7 of annual revenue we expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of 11 to 12 of revenue in 2022 to expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet the market demands and further improve our manufacturing cost structure 

as of december 31 2021 there was 15982 million outstanding under the term loan b facility in addition to 805 million aggregate principal amount of the 0 notes 700 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 notes and 1551 million aggregate principal amount of the 1625 notes the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 1625 notes net of unamortized discount and issuance costs has been reclassified as a current portion of longterm debt the associated interest expense related to this indebtedness will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations 

see note 5 acquisitions and divestitures and note 9 longterm debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

cash management 

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms for new products 

primary cash flow sources 

our longterm cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash our cash flows from operating activities were 17820 million 8843 million and 6947 million for the years ende d december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively our operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 8977 million or 1015 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 which was primarily due to better economic conditions resulting in significantly increased demand for our products increase in average selling prices better mix in the products sold cash savings from restructuring activities and better working capital management 

our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on among other factors our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below 

working capital 

working capital calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs in addition our working capital may be affected by acquisitions and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives 

our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of longterm debt was 10463 million as of december 31 2021 and has fluctuated between 8850 million and 10571 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters our working capital including cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of longterm debt was 22382 

million as of december 31 2021 and has fluctuated between 14576 million and 23798 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters the significant fluctuation was due to the withdrawal and repayment on our revolving credit facility during 2020 and 2021 as well as the reclassification of the 1625 notes as a current liability we expect a significant increase in capital expenditures during 2022 

longterm assets and liabilities 

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets deferred taxes and goodwill our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt and deferred taxes consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans operating lease liabilities and contingent tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions for additional information see note 12 employee benefit plans note 8 balance sheet information and note 16 income taxes in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

key financing and capital events 

overview 

for the past several years we have undertaken various measures to secure liquidity to pursue acquisitions repurchase shares of our common stock reduce interest costs amend existing key financing arrangements and in some cases extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility certain of these measures continued in 2021 set forth below is a summary of certain key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years for further discussion of our debt instruments see note 9 longterm debt and for further discussion on the share repurchase program as defined below see note 10 earnings per share and equity in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience current and expected future conditions thirdparty evaluations and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following i future payouts for customer incentives and amounts subject to allowances and returns ii valuation and obsolescence relating to inventories iii measurement of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and evaluations of uncertain tax positions and iv assumptions used in business combinations additionally during periods where it becomes applicable significant estimates will be used by management in determining the future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of longlived assets and goodwill actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the consolidated financial statements 

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to direct customers and distributors we also generate revenue to a much lesser extent from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled for sales agreements we have identified the promise to transfer products each of which is distinct to be the performance obligation for product development agreements we have identified the completion of a service defined in the agreement to be the performance obligation we apply a fivestep approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized 1 identifying the contract with a customer 2 identifying the performance obligations in the contract 3 determining the transaction price 4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied we allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled substantially all of our revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer 

sales to certain distributors primarily those with ship and credit rights can be subject to price adjustment on certain products we develop an estimate of their expected claims under the ship and credit program based on the historical claims data submitted by product and customer and expected future claims which requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the amount of each claim as well as the historical period used to develop the estimate 

  

our direct customers do not have the right to return products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances ship and credit claims and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue are recognized 

and are netted against revenue for nonquality related returns we recognize a related asset for the right to recover returned products with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold we record a reserve for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenue based on the experience with each customer 

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected enduser demand the determination of projected enduser demand requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected unit sales for each product these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory that is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved impacting our cost of revenue and gross profit the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded however we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been consistently insignificant and the related impact on our margins has also been insignificant 

income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under this method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

in determining the amount of the valuation allowance estimated future taxable income feasible tax planning strategies future reversals of existing temporary differences and taxable income in prior carryback years if a carryback is permitted are considered if we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 

  

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement no tax benefit is recognized for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made which could have a material impact to our effective tax rate 

business combination we use estimates and assumptions in allocating the purchase price of acquired business by utilizing established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology industry to record the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value we utilize the income approach cost approach or market approach depending upon which approach is the most appropriate based on the nature and reliability of available data if the income approach is used the fair value determination is predicated upon the value of the future cash flows that an asset is expected to generate over its economic life and involves significant assumptions as to cash flows associated expenses longterm growth rates and discount rates the cost approach takes into account the cost to replace or reproduce the asset and involves assumptions relating to the assets value of physical functional andor economic obsolescence that has occurred with respect to the asset the market approach is used to estimate value from an analysis of actual transactions or offerings for economically comparable assets available as of the valuation date determining the fair value of acquired technology assets is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including the discount rate revenue growth rates projected gross margins and estimated research and development expenses 

impairment of goodwill and longlived assets we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable our impairment evaluation consists of a qualitative assessment and if deemed necessary a quantitative test is performed which compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows discount and longterm growth rates we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows the assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenue gross profit operating expenses and industry trends we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and longterm growth rates to use in its analysis we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value 

we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount impairment losses if applicable are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests as we continue to implement our business strategy to rationalize products and manufacturing locations to transition to a lighter internal fabrication model there could be divestiture transactions resulting in a portion of goodwill or other assets being derecognized and which may or may not result in accounting charges 

contingencies  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

as of december 31 2021 our gross longterm debt including current maturities totaled 32583 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 31601 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 982 million balance of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2021 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately 42 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase our interest rate swaps hedge the majority of the risk of variability in cash flows resulting from future interest payments on our variable interest rate debt 

while we have observed stabilization in the capital markets impacted by the covid19 pandemic there can be no assurance that equity or borrowings will be available when we access the capital markets again or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 

to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures from an accounting and economic perspective however given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged we cannot provide any assurances that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the us dollar as a normal part of the reporting 

process some of our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a nonfunctional currency changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged the notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2021 and 2020 was 2883 million and 2634 million respectively our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies including chinese renminbi czech koruna euros japanese yen korean won malaysian ringgit philippine peso and vietnamese dong due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the us dollar for example we determined that based on a hypothetical weightedaverage change of 10 in currency exchange rates our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately 1437 million for the year ended december 31 2021 assuming no offsetting hedge position or correlated activities

 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the exchange act based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

we also carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2021 

there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2021 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting

business overview 

on semiconductor corporation together with its wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries on semiconductor we us our or the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in 1992 under the name motorola energy systems inc immediately prior to our august 4 1999 recapitalization we were a whollyowned subsidiary of motorola 

on semiconductor is driving innovation in energyefficient electronics we believe that our extensive portfolio of sensors power management connectivity custom and soc analog logic timing and discrete devices helps customers efficiently solve their design challenges in advanced electronic systems and products our power management and motor driver semiconductor components control convert protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our custom asics and soc devices use analog mcu dsp mixedsignal and advanced logic capabilities to enable the application and uses of many of our automotive medical aerospacedefense consumer and industrial customers’ products our signal management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing communications and industrial systems our portfolio of sensors including image sensors radar and lidar provide advanced solutions for automotive industrial and iot applications our high performance wifi solution creates a strong platform for addressing connectivity solutions for industrial iot applications our standard semiconductor components serve as building blocks within virtually all types of electronic devices 

as of december 31 2020 we were organized into the following three operating and reportable segments the power solutions group psg the advanced solutions group asg and the intelligent sensing group isg 

recent business strategy developments 

our primary focus is on gross margin expansion while at the same time achieving significant revenue growth in our focused endmarkets of automotive industrial and communication infrastructure as well as being opportunistic in other endmarkets 

in light of these objectives we have begun the process of evaluating our current product portfolio we intend to allocate capital and research and development investments and resources to accelerate growth in highmargin products and endmarkets by moving away from nondifferentiated products which have had historically lower gross margins and in that process reduce complexity streamline the organization and improve operating efficiencies 

additionally we believe these actions will allow us to transition to a lighter internal fabrication model where our gross margins will be less volatile and not as heavily influenced by our internal manufacturing volumes as further discussed below we are also rationalizing our manufacturing footprint to align with our investment priorities and corporate strategy our goal is to reduce volatility in our gross margins and maximize return on our manufacturing investments with the intent to have our product strategy drive our manufacturing footprint and capital investments 

novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 to be a pandemic which continues to spread throughout the us and the world our results of operations were adversely impacted during the majority of 2020 due to the reduced demand from our customers governmentmandated temporary shutdowns of certain of our facilities supply shortages and other logistical constraints arising from the covid19 pandemic 

we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on us due to a number of uncertainties including the duration and severity of the outbreak globally and in particular in the markets in which we do business the impact of the pandemic on our customers businesses the imposition of any future government restrictions on staffing and facility operations supply chain shortages and other disruptions without global containment it is likely that the pandemic will continue to have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future 

pending and completed acquisitions 

on april 22 2019 we entered into an asset purchase agreement the asset purchase agreement with globalfoundries us inc gfus and globalfoundries inc pursuant to which we will acquire gfus’s east 

fishkill new york site and fabrication facilities and certain other assets and liabilities on or around december 31 2022 the closing date subject to certain conditions for an aggregate purchase price of 4000 million in cash subject to adjustment as described in the asset purchase agreement the total consideration on april 22 2019 we paid gfus 700 million of the total consideration in cash as a nonrefundable deposit which will be applied toward and reduce the total consideration 

on october 1 2020 we entered into an amendment to the asset purchase agreement the apa amendment pursuant to which we paid gfus a nonrefundable deposit in the amount of 1000 million in cash on october 5 2020 the additional deposit the additional deposit will be applied toward and reduce the total consideration as a nonrefundable deposit and the remaining 2300 million of the total consideration will be paid on or around the closing date other terms and conditions of the asset purchase agreement remain unchanged 

with the expected completion of the acquisition in east fishkill new york on or around december 31 2022 we initiated structural changes to our manufacturing footprint during february and august 2020 we announced that we were exploring the sales of our sixinch fabrication facilities in oudenaarde belgium and niigata japan respectively we could incur accounting charges in the future in connection with the active marketing and sale of these fabrication facilities and for costs to transition the manufacturing activity to other sites in our manufacturing network 

on june 19 2019 we completed our acquisition of quantenna communications inc quantenna following the acquisition quantenna changed its name to on semiconductor connectivity solutions inc the purchase price totaled 10393 million and was funded with the proceeds from a 9000 million draw against our revolving credit facility and cash on hand we believe the acquisition of quantenna creates a strong platform for addressing connectivity solutions for industrial iot by combining our expertise in power management and bluetooth technologies with quantennas wifi technologies and software capabilities

competition 

  

we face significant competition from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because some of our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fullycustomized ics as well as customers who develop their own ic products see risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

in comparison several of our competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers the following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments 

psg 

  

our competitive strengths include our core competencies of leading edge fabrication technologies micro packaging expertise breadth of product line and ip portfolio high quality cost effective manufacturing and supply chain management which ensures supply to our customers our commitment to continual innovation allows us to provide an ever broader range of semiconductor solutions to our customers who differentiate in power density and power efficiency the key performance characteristics driving our markets 

the principal methods of competition in our discrete module and integrated semiconductor products are through new products and package innovations enabling enhanced performance over existing products of particular importance are our power mosfets igbts wbg mosfets and diodes including sic and gan rectifiers and power module portfolio for power conversion applications and esd portfolio for hispeed serial interface protection products where we believe we have significant performance advantages over our competition psgs competitors include broadcom limited broadcom diodes incorporated infineon technologies ag infineon kec corporation nexperia bv rohm semiconductor usa llc rohm semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv stmicroelectronics texas instruments incorporated ti toshiba corporation toshiba and vishay intertechnology inc 

asg 

  

asg principally competes on design experience manufacturing capability depth and quality of ip ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product length of design cycle longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel our competitive position with respect to the above basis is enhanced by longstanding relationships with leading oem customers 

our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables these variables include but are not limited to the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies product performance and quality manufacturing yields and availability of supply customer service pricing industry trends and general economic trends competitors for certain of asgs products and solutions include infineon nxp semiconductors nv nxp stmicroelectronics and ti 

isg 

isg differentiates itself from the competition through deep technical knowledge and close customer relationships to drive leading edge sensing performance for both human and machine vision applications isg has significant imaging experience and was one of the earliest to commercialize cmos active pixel sensors and introduce cmos technology in many of our markets isg has leveraged this expertise into market leading positions in automotive and industrial applications which allows us to offer technical and enduser applications knowledge to help customers develop innovative sensing solutions across a broad range of enduser needs 

competitors for certain of isgs products and solutions include sony semiconductor manufacturing corporation sony semiconductor samsung electronics co ltd samsung omnivision stmicroelectronics and toshiba for image sensors rohm renesas electronics corporation and dongwoon anatech co ltd for actuator drivers ti nxp and infineon for radar and hamamatsu photonics kk broadcom and st microelectronics for sipms and spads 

sales marketing and distribution 

as of december 31 2020 our sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 1700 professionals servicing customers globally we support our customers through justintime warehouses we have global distribution centers in china the philippines and singapore global and regional distribution channels further support our customers needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective global applications support from our technical information centers and solution engineering centers allowing for applications that are developed in one region of the world to be instantaneously available throughout all other regions 

backlog 

our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are predominantly booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our edi customers in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times during 2020 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 85 and 97 of actual revenue during such quarter which is slightly higher than the backlog levels in recent prior periods as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases customers tend to order products further in advance and as a result backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenue during such period is likely to increase 

  

in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancellable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 

we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations we routinely generate inventory based on customers estimates of enduser demand for their products which are difficult to predict see risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business located elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information regarding the inventory practices within the semiconductor industry 

resources 

raw materials 

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers sic wafers laminate substrates gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases as well as other production supplies used in our manufacturing processes we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a justintime basis and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our contractual obligations table in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—contractual obligations included elsewhere in this form 10k from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply as experienced during the covid19 pandemic and increased demand in the industry or other factors

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

changes in and the regulatory implementation of tariffs or other government trade policies could reduce demand for our products limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or comply with applicable laws and regulations which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions as a result of international trade disputes or changes in trade policies may adversely affect our sales and profitability for example in recent years the us government imposed and proposed among other actions new or higher tariffs on specified imported products originating from the peoples republic of china the prc in response to what it characterized as unfair trade practices and the prc responded by imposing and proposing new or higher tariffs on specified products including some semiconductors fabricated in the united states and certain transistors diodes ics and other products that we import into the prc as part of our supply chain these tariffs and the related geopolitical uncertainty between the united states and the prc may cause decreased endmarket demand for our products from distributors and other customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations ongoing international trade disputes and changes in trade policies could also impact economic activity and lead to a general contraction of customer demand in addition tariffs on components that we import from the prc or other nations that have imposed or may in the future impose tariffs will adversely affect our profitability unless we are able to exclude such components from the tariffs or we raise prices for our products which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors future actions or escalations by either the united states or the prc that affect trade relations may also impact our business or that of our suppliers or customers and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether such actions will occur or the form that they may take to the extent that our sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our international sales and purchases are subject to numerous united states and foreign laws and regulations including without limitation tariffs trade sanctions trade barriers trade embargoes regulations relating to importexport control technology transfer restrictions the international traffic in arms regulation promulgated under the arms export control act fcpa and the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act licenses or proper license exceptions are required 

for the shipment of our products to certain countries a determination by the us government or any foreign government that we have failed to comply with trade or export regulations or antibribery regulations can result in penalties including fines administrative civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities seizure of products or in the extreme case denial of export privileges or suspension or debarment from government contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our sales business and results of operations 

additionally us or china governmental authorities have taken and may continue to take administrative legislative or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to make sales to certain of our customers we could experience unanticipated export bans or other restrictions on our ability to sell to certain customers where sales of products and the provision of services may require export licenses or are prohibited by government action export restrictions may also include technical discussions with customers that can impede our ability to pursue designwins with customers and may impact future sales in may 2019 the us department of commerce added huawei technologies co ltd and certain of its nonus affiliates and subsidiaries collectively huawei and certain of our other customers to the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security the bis entity list the entity list imposing restrictions on the export and transfer of goods and technologies to such entities additionally in august 2020 the bis issued final rules that among other things further mandated license permissions to ship our products to huawei and added additional nonus huawei affiliates to the entity list in response to these actions the prc has initiated reciprocal actions against the united states as a result of which additional export or other restrictions are anticipated the terms and duration of any such restrictions may not be known to us in advance and may be subject to ongoing modifications including modifications that impose more stringent restrictions or conditions on our ability to sell our products and services to certain foreign customers even to the extent such restrictions are subsequently modified lifted or temporarily suspended any financial or other penalties imposed on affected foreign customers could have a negative impact on future orders these foreign customers may also respond to sanctions or the threat of sanctions by employing their own solutions to address the impacts of restrictions the loss or temporary loss of customers as a result of such future regulatory limitations could materially adversely affect our sales business and results of operations 

many of our facilities and processes are interdependent and an operational disruption at any particular facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce many of our products which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our manufacturing platform includes multiple owned and thirdparty facilities which may each produce one or more components necessary for the assembly of a single product as a result of this interdependence an operational disruption at a facility may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products in the event of a disruption at any such facility we may be unable to effectively source replacement components on acceptable terms from qualified third parties in which case our ability to produce many of our products could be materially disrupted or delayed conversely many of our facilities are single source facilities that only produce one of our endproducts and a disruption at any such facility would materially delay or cease production of the related product in the event of any such operational disruption we may experience difficulty in beginning production of replacement components or products at new facilities for example due to construction delays or transferring production to other existing facilities for example due to capacity constraints or difficulty in transitioning to new manufacturing processes any of which could result in a loss of future revenues and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business has been and is expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic in addition to global macroeconomic effects the covid19 pandemic and related adverse public health developments have been causing and are expected to continue to cause disruption to our domestic and international operations and sales activities in addition we and our suppliers thirdparty distributors subcontractors and customers have been and are expected to continue to be disrupted by worker absenteeism quarantines and restrictions on certain of our employees’ ability to perform their jobs office and factory closures or restrictions disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure border closures or other travel or healthrelated restrictions depending on the magnitude of such effects on our manufacturing activities or the operations of our suppliers thirdparty distributors or subcontractors our supply chain manufacturing and product shipments could be delayed which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the covid19 pandemic or other disease outbreaks will in the shortterm and could over the longer term adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn or recession that could adversely affect demand for our products and impact our results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance that any decrease in sales resulting from the covid19 pandemic will be offset by increased sales in subsequent periods these effects alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations legal exposure or financial condition the extent of the covid19 pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future 

developments including the duration spread and intensity of the pandemic all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict due to the speed with which the situation is developing we are not able at this time to estimate the longterm effect of these factors on our business but the adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows has been and could continue to be material 

if we are unable to identify and make the substantial research and development investments or develop new products required to satisfy customer demands or regulatory requirements as required to remain competitive in our business our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process and often requires significant capital investment and lead time for development and testing we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive in addition the lengthy development cycle for our products limits our ability to adapt quickly to changes affecting the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and we may be unable to develop innovative responses to our customers’ and endusers’ evolving needs on the timelines they require or at all there can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes known as design wins for new products in addition design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or that we will generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments as expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured there is no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop new products that a significant investment in new products will be profitable or that we will have margins as high as we anticipate at the time of investment or have experienced historically to the extent that we underinvest in our research and development efforts fail to recognize the need for innovation with respect to our products or that our investments and capital expenditures in research and development do not lead to sales of new products we may be unable to bring to market technologies and products that are attractive to our customers and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies innovation short product life cycles evolving regulatory and industry standards and certifications changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions our success is largely dependent on our ability to accurately predict identify and adapt to changes affecting the requirements of our customers in a timely and costeffective manner products are frequently replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes and as demand for older technology falls the price at which such products can be sold drops in some cases precipitously if we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our production efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of older products in certain limited cases we may not be able to cease production of older products either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products for a sustained period of time if reductions in our production costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected additionally the emergence of new industry or regulatory standards and certification requirements may adversely affect the demand for our products a fundamental shift in technologies excess inventory levels for our or our competitors’ products the regulatory climate or consumption patterns and preferences in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could result in or accelerate price erosion for our products or make them obsolete prevent or delay the introduction of new products that we planned to make or render our current or new products irrelevant to our customers’ needs if our new product development efforts fail to align with the needs of our customers including due to circumstances outside of our control like a fundamental shift in the product markets of our customers and endusers or regulatory changes our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the automotive industrial and communications industries a downturn or lower sales to customers in one or more of these industries could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

a significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive industrial including medical aerospace and defense and communications industries including wireless and networking sales into these industries represented approximately 32 25 and 20 of our revenue respectively for the year ended december 31 2020 and those percentages will vary from quarter to quarter each of the automotive industrial and communications industries is cyclical and as a result our customers in these industries are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions disruptive innovation and endmarket preferences which can adversely affect sales of our products and correspondingly our results of operations additionally the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in these industries could decline despite continued growth in their respective end markets lower sales to customers in the automotive industrial or communications industries may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain manufacturing efficiency which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing requires advanced equipment and significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs that include depreciation expense manufacturing semiconductor components also involves highly complex processes that we and our competitors are continuously modifying to improve yields and product performance in addition impurities waste or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower production yields our manufacturing efficiency is and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or be successful in our manufacturing rationalization plans if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing facilities testing facilities and external manufacturers at expected or minimum purchase obligation levels or if production capacity increases while revenue does not the fixed costs and other operating expenses associated with these facilities and arrangements will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the failure to successfully implement cost reduction initiatives including through restructuring activities could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

from time to time we have implemented cost reduction initiatives including relocating manufacturing to lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to lower costs implementing personnel reductions and voluntary retirement programs reducing employee compensation temporary or permanent shutdowns of facilities and aggressively streamlining our overhead in addition we continuously monitor productivity and capital expenditures at our facilities in order to make strategic determinations regarding the temporary or permanent shutdown or disposition of facilities to improve our cost structure in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs have been primarily composed of employee separation costs including severance payments and asset impairments we also often undertake restructuring activities and programs to improve our cost structure in connection with our business acquisitions which can result in significant charges including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges 

we cannot assure you that our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business including but not limited to the location of our production facilities and personnel the associated cost reductions could materially adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position cost reduction measures may also result in reduced compliance budgets and ultimately our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations if we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental fines or similar costs additionally our initiatives to reduce our costs may make it difficult for us to attract motivate and retain our key employees andor impact the breadth of our ip portfolio which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and on our business to the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other benefits of our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives that we anticipate our results of operations may be materially adversely effected  

uncertainties regarding the timing and amount of customer orders could lead to excess inventory and writedowns of inventory that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers requiring a commitment to purchase our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and generally prior to start of production for custom products without incurring a penalty we routinely generate inventory based on customers’ estimates of enduser demand for their products which is difficult to predict in times of under supply for certain products some customers could respond by inflating their demand signals as markets level off and supply capacity begins to match actual market demands we could experience an increased risk of inventory writedowns which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction of products due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under 

our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers unsold inventory canceled orders and cancellation penalties may materially adversely affect our results of operations and inventory writedowns which may materially adversely affect our financial condition 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has experienced rapid consolidation and if we are unable to compete effectively or are unable to identify attractive opportunities for consolidation it could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fully customized ics as well as from customers who develop their own ic products in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

if we are unable to compete effectively such inability to compete could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations products or technologies developed by competitors that are larger and have more substantial research and development budgets or that are smaller and more targeted in their development efforts may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive we also may be unable to market and sell our products if they are not competitive on the basis of price quality technical performance features system compatibility customized design innovation availability delivery timing and reliability if we fail to compete effectively on developing strategic relationships with customers and customer sales and technical support our sales and revenue may be materially adversely affected competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise prices and any inability to maintain revenue or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a significant adverse effect on our gross margin reduced sales and lower gross margins would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including but not limited to more efficient cost structures substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition in addition we may be at a competitive disadvantage to our peers if we fail to identify attractive opportunities to acquire companies to expand our business consolidation among our competitors and integration among our customers could erode our market share negatively impact our capacity to compete and require us to restructure our operations any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are dependent on the services of thirdparty suppliers and contract manufacturers and any disruption in or deterioration of the quality of the services or goods delivered by such third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use thirdparty contractors for certain of our manufacturing activities primarily wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods and for the supply of raw materials our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to commit to purchase services based on forecasted product needs which may be inaccurate and in some cases require longerterm commitments we are also dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized thirdparty suppliers for required components and materials for certain of our key technologies arranging for replacement manufacturers and suppliers can be time consuming and costly and the number of qualified alternative providers can be extremely limited our business operations productivity and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasted needs proved to be materially incorrect our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including various chemicals and gases polysilicon silicon wafers aluminum gold silver copper lead frames mold compound and ceramic packages generally our agreements with suppliers of raw materials impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers of raw materials may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors beyond our control shortages could occur in various essential raw materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner the costs of our raw materials increases significantly their quality deteriorates or they give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process requiring production in a tightly controlled clean environment minute impurities in our manufacturing materials contaminants in the manufacturing environment manufacturing equipment failures and other defects can cause our products to be noncompliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in electrical design oems are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage if any and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall could have material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them and claims for consequential damages against our customers from their customers we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenue and profits we receive from the products involved in certain instances we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective and to the extent that we are liable for damages in excess of the revenue and profits we received from the products involved our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

currency fluctuations changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sizeable sales and operations in the asiapacific region and europe and a significant amount of this business is transacted in currency other than us dollars in addition while a significant percentage of our cash is generated outside the us many of our liabilities including our outstanding indebtedness and certain other cash payments such as share repurchases are payable in the us in us dollars as a result currency fluctuations and changes in foreign exchange regulations can have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

in addition repatriation of funds held outside the us could have adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay due to required local country approvals or local obligations from time to time we are required to make cash deposits outside of the us to support bank guarantees of our obligations under certain office leases or amounts we owe to certain vendors and such cash deposits are not available for other uses as long as the related bank guarantees are outstanding foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency as a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the us our financial flexibility may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations restrictions on repatriation or the inability to use cash held abroad to fund our operations in the us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

trends risks and uncertainties related to intellectual property 

if our technologies are subject to claims of infringement on the ip rights of others efforts to address such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may from time to time be subject to claims that we may be infringing the ip rights of others if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such ip rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for ip we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring such technologies further we may be subject to ip litigation which could cause us to incur significant expense materially adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome or pursuant to the terms of a settlement of any such litigation we may be required to 

• pay substantial damages or settlement costs 

• indemnify customers or distributors 

• cease the manufacture use sale or importation of infringing products 

• expend significant resources to develop or acquire noninfringing technologies 

• discontinue the use of processes or 

• obtain licenses which may not be available on reasonable terms to the infringing technologies 

please see note 13 commitments and contingencies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a more detailed description of the litigation we are currently engaged in the outcome of ip litigation is inherently uncertain and if not resolved in our favor could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to protect the ip we use our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the enforceability of our patents trademarks copyrights software licenses and other ip is uncertain in certain circumstances effective ip protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the us and internationally the various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered ip assets patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts with respect to our ip generally we cannot assure you that 

• any of the substantial number of us or foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated circumvented challenged abandoned or licensed to others 

• any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought

when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights of its own against us which may materially adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications we seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to ip arising out of our research should we be unable to protect our ip competitors may develop products or technologies that duplicate our products or technologies benefit financially from innovations for which we bore the costs of development and undercut the sales and marketing of our products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

trends risks and uncertainties related to technology and data privacy 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could irreparably damage our reputation and our business expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we routinely collect and store sensitive data including confidential and other proprietary information about our business and our customers suppliers and business partners the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses illegal hacking criminal fraud or impersonation acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error our security measures andor those of our thirdparty service providers andor customers may not detect or prevent such security breaches the costs to us to reduce the risk of or alleviate cyber security breaches and vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may materially impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions any such compromise of our information security could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business an interruption in our operations the unauthorized transfer of cash or other of our assets the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws in addition computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that 

attack our products or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities and any such attack if successful could expose us to liability to customer claims any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the company is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future the company collects personally identifiable information pii and other data as part of its business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union and other relevant jurisdictions where the company conducts business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are currently more restrictive than those in the us additionally in may 2016 the european union adopted the general data protection regulation that imposed more stringent data protection requirements and provided for greater penalties for noncompliance beginning in may 2018 in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union declared the euus privacy shield which had been an accepted mechanism to comply with data transfers between the european union and the united states invalid any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or to comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to the company or company officials including substantial monetary fines and could damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business 

trends risks and uncertainties related to regulation 

environmental and health and safety liabilities and expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations for example our manufacturing operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground and we have been identified as either a primary responsible party or a potentially responsible party at sites where we or our predecessors operated or disposed of waste in the past our other operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other requirements regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances we have indemnities from third parties for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities for periods prior to our operations at some of our current and past sites and we have also purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance will cover any or all of our material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities including 

• changes in us and international environmental or health and safety laws or regulations including but not limited to future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns 

• the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced administered or interpreted 

• our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities 

• the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims including the cost of cleanup of currently unknown environmental conditions or 

• the cost of fines penalties or other legal liability should we fail to comply with environmental or health and safety laws or regulations 

to the extent that we face unforeseen environmental or health and safety compliance costs or remediation expenses or liabilities that are not covered by indemnities or insurance we may bear the full effect of such costs expenses and liabilities which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

compliance with regulations regarding the use of “conflict minerals” could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain raw materials used in manufacturing our products 

the sec as mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 adopted disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products containing certain minerals that are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and procedures pertaining to a manufacturer’s efforts regarding the source of such minerals these conflict minerals are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors manufacturers 

are also required to disclose their efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from them the implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of metals used in the manufacture of our products we may also incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as free of conflict materials which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue 

we are subject to anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate including the fcpa our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to the fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws to which we are subject there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire we have significant operations in asia which place us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered “foreign officials” under the fcpa resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by the us or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

trends risks and uncertainties related to our indebtedness 

our debt could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2020 we had 35895 million of outstanding indebtedness we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future to repay or refinance other outstanding debt to make acquisitions or for other purposes and if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify for example on march 24 2020 as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and facilitate financial flexibility in light of uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic we borrowed an additional 11650 million under the revolving credit facility on august 21 2020 we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 3875 notes along with cash on hand to repay 12000 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 we have approximately 12690 million available for future borrowings under the revolving credit facility the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

• our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 

• the timing amount and execution of our capital allocation policy including our 2018 share repurchase program as defined below could be affected by the degree to which we are leveraged 

• a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt which reduces the funds available to us for our operations and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests 

• some of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates 

• our debt agreements may contain and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain financial and restrictive covenants and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on us 

• our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to and reduce our flexibility to respond to general economic downturns and adverse industry and business conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• as our longterm debt ages we must repay and may need to renegotiate such debt or seek additional financing 

• to the extent the debt we incur requires collateral to secure such indebtedness our assets could be at risk and our flexibility related to such assets could be limited 

• our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the semiconductor industry 

• our ability to deduct interest expense that we may incur may be limited or deferred under us andor local tax rules including section 163j of the code and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and 

• our level of indebtedness may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors 

to the extent that we continue to maintain or expand our significant indebtedness our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the inability to meet our obligations under our amended credit agreement could materially and adversely affect us by among other things limiting our ability to conduct our operations and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

our amended credit agreement provides for our 197 billion revolving credit facility and our 24 billion term loan b facility the proceeds of which have been used among other things to fund acquisitions the obligations under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the personal property and material real property assets of the company and most of the company’s domestic subsidiaries as a result if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the amended credit agreement the lenders could take possession of and foreclose on the pledged collateral securing the indebtedness in which case we would be at risk of losing the related collateral which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations in addition subject to customary exceptions the amended credit agreement requires mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances which may result in prepaying outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility and the term loan b facility rather than using funds for other business purposes our financing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition including among other things our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and could reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

the agreements relating to our indebtedness including the amended credit agreement and the 3875 notes may restrict our ability to operate our business and as a result may materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our debt agreements including the amended credit agreement and the 3875 notes contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to 

• incur additional debt including issuing guarantees 

• incur liens 

• make certain investments 

• settle a conversion of our 1625 notes in whole or in part with cash 

• redeem or otherwise perform our obligations under the terms of our 3875 notes 

• sell or otherwise dispose of assets 

• make some acquisitions 

• engage in mergers or consolidations or certain other change of control transactions 

• make distributions to our stockholders 

• engage in restructuring activities 

• engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions and 

• issue or repurchase stock or other securities 

such agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them to the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations our financial condition may be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us to the extent that we are unable to engage in activities that support the growth profitability and competitiveness of our business our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations and any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations as they come due we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments 

then in effect furthermore we cannot assure you that if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness which could materially negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition a default under our committed credit facilities including our amended credit agreement could also limit our ability to make further borrowings under those facilities which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to the current stockholders 

an event of default under any agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness could cross default other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if there were an event of default under certain of our agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness any such cross default would put immediate pressure on our liquidity and financial condition and would amplify the risks described above with regards to being unable to repay our indebtedness when due and payable we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our operating subsidiaries which may have no independent obligation to repay our debt are not able to make cash available to us for such repayment our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal contractual governmental or regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if interest rates increase our debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could increase significantly which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

borrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time including under our amended credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and as a result expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease during the first quarters of 2017 and 2019 and the second quarter of 2020 we entered into interest rate swaps that involved the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility for a portion of our term loan b facility and our revolving credit facility through the end of 2022 however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk to the extent the risk materializes and is not fully mitigated the resulting increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

some of our current debt and related agreements including the amended credit agreement and our interest rate swap agreements have an interest rate tied to libo rate while certain of these agreements such as the amended credit agreement provide procedures for determining an alternative base rate in the event that libo rate is discontinued not all do so on july 27 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority fca which regulates the libo rate announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libo rate quotations by the end of 2021 further on november 30 2020 the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal deposit insurance corp and the office of the comptroller of the currency issued a joint statement the joint statement on libo rate transition in connection with which ice benchmark administration limited in its capacity as administrator of us libo rate announced its plan to extend the date that most us libo rate values would cease being computed and announced from december 31 2021 to june 30 2023 even though us libo rate would continue to be published through june 30 2023 the joint statement called on banks to cease 

entering into new contracts that use us libo rate as a reference rate by no later than december 31 2021 and if practicable as far in advance of that deadline as possible regardless there can be no assurances as to what alternative base rates may be and whether such base rate will be more or less favorable than libo rate and any other unforeseen impacts of the potential discontinuation of libo rate the company intends to monitor the developments with respect to the potential phasing out of libo rate and work with its lenders to ensure any transition away from libo rate will have minimal impact on its financial condition but can provide no assurances that the impact of the discontinuation of libo rate would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

servicing the 1625 notes and the 3875 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 1625 notes and the 3875 notes in a timely manner 

in march 2017 we issued 5750 million aggregate principal amount of our 1625 notes and in august 2020 we issued 7000 million aggregate principal amount of our 3875 notes holders of the 1625 notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 1625 notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined under the respective indentures governing such notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any accrued prior to but not including the fundamental change repurchase date holders of the 3875 notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all of their 3875 notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events accompanied by certain ratings events as described in the indenture governing the 3875 notes at a repurchase price equal to 101 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any accrued prior to but not including the repurchase date moreover we will be required to repay the 1625 notes and the 3875 notes in cash at their respective maturity dates unless earlier repurchased or in the case of the 1625 notes converted in addition upon conversion of the 1625 notes to be repurchased unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares we will be required to make cash payments in respect of such 1625 notes being converted 

servicing the 1625 notes and the 3875 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under such notes our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 1625 notes repurchase the 1625 notes or the 3875 notes in the case of an applicable repurchasetriggering event under the respective indentures or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the 1625 notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would dilute existing stockholders 

in addition if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the 1625 notes or the 3875 notes following the applicable repurchasetriggering events we would be in default under the terms of such notes which could cross default other debt and materially adversely harm our business in certain circumstances a takeover of our company and similar triggering events could also trigger an option of the holders of the 1625 notes and the 3875 notes to require us to repurchase such notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors in the 1625 notes the 3875 notes and our common stock which could materially decrease the value of such notes and of our common stock 

the terms of the amended credit agreement and the terms of the 3875 notes limit the amount of future indebtedness secured by liens that we may incur but the terms of the 1625 notes do not contain such limits if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above our decision to use our cash for other purposes such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock could also intensify these risks 

the conditional conversion feature of the 1625 notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and if we elect to settle the conversion of the 1625 notes in common stock any such settlement could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

if specified conditions are met holders of the 1625 notes may convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding july 15 2023 unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligations by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares in the event the conditional conversion feature under the 1625 notes is triggered holders electing to convert their notes could require us to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligations through the payment of cash which could materially adversely affect our liquidity additionally when the conditional conversion feature under the 1625 notes is triggered at the end of the reporting period we are required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify the outstanding principal of such notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital a conditional conversion feature has 

been triggered as of december 31 2020 and we can provide no assurance as to when or whether these conditional conversion features will lapse or be triggered again in the future any material decrease in our liquidity or reduction in our net working capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may elect to settle the 1625 notes solely in common stock to avoid an event of default under our amended credit agreement and any such issuance of common stock could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders including stockholders who previously converted such notes to shares of our common stock 

note hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

concurrently with the issuance of the 1625 notes we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions which we refer to as the option counterparties the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the respective series of notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes of such series as the case may be we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties with respect to the 1625 notes and the 100 notes the warrants we entered with option counterparties for the 100 notes are still outstanding the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds 2596 with respect to the 100 notes and 3070 with respect to the 1625 notes the warrants with respect to the 100 notes can be exercised by holders beginning in march 2021 and expire no later than april 2021 we currently anticipate the holders of the 100 notes to exercise the warrants to purchase up to 373 million shares of common stock from us which will be settled on a netshare basis depending on the average stock price on the day of exercise 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock andor entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock following the pricing of the 1625 notes the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of 1625 notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 1625 notes following any repurchase of 1625 notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions if realized could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we are subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral if one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions 

to the extent the option counterparties do not honor their contractual commitments with us pursuant to the note hedge transactions we could face a material increase in our exposure to potential dilution upon any conversion of the 1625 notes andor cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 1625 notes as the case may be our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock in addition upon a default by one of the option counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences with respect to our common stock any such adverse tax consequences or increased cash payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

trends risks and uncertainties related to our common stock 

the stockholders’ rights plan adopted by our board of directors may discourage a third party from acquiring us in a manner that might result in a premium price to our stockholders 

on june 7 2020 our board of directors authorized and declared a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock if a person or group of affiliated or associated persons acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of our then outstanding common stock subject to certain exceptions each right would entitle its holder other than the acquiring person or group of affiliated or associated persons to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a substantial discount to the 

public market price in addition under certain circumstances we may exchange the rights other than rights beneficially owned by the acquiring person or group of affiliated or associated persons in whole or in part for shares of our common stock on a oneforone basis the stockholders’ rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a large block of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors which may discourage a third party from acquiring us in a manner that might result in a premium price to our stockholders 

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

• establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting 

• authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock which is preferred stock that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval and that could be issued with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and 

• require the approval by holders of at least 66 23 of our outstanding common stock to amend any of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders any delay or prevention of an acquisition of our company that would have been beneficial to our stockholders could materially decrease the value of our common stock 

general risk factors 

downturns or volatility in general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in recent years worldwide semiconductor industry sales have tracked the impacts of financial crises subsequent recoveries and persistent economic uncertainty we believe that the state of global economic conditions are particularly volatile and uncertain and that an uneven recovery or a renewed global downturn may put pressure on our sales due to reductions in customer demand volatile or uncertain economic conditions as well as continuing political unrest in markets in which we conduct significant business can adversely impact sales and profitability and make it difficult for us and our competitors to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and as a result subject to significant downturns and upturns in customer demand for semiconductors and related products we believe our business today is driven more by secular growth drivers and not solely by macroeconomic and industry cyclicality as was the case historically however we could experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions we cannot accurately predict the timing of future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry or how severe and prolonged these conditions might be significant downturns can result in reduced product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results as a result of increased operating expenses outpacing decreased revenue reduced margins underutilization of our manufacturing capacity andor asset impairment charges on the other hand significant upturns can cause us to be unable to satisfy demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in the event of such an upturn we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our products and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts often in markets or regions in which we have less experience than others our decision to pursue an acquisition is based on among other factors our estimates of expected future earnings growth and potential cost savings risks related to successful integration of an acquisition include but are not limited to 1 the ability to integrate information technology and other systems 2 unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence 3 customers 

responding by changing their existing business relationships with us or the acquired company 4 diversion of management’s attention from our day to day operations and 5 loss of key employees due to uncertainty about positions postintegration in addition we may incur unexpected costs such as operating or restructuring costs including severance payments to departing employees or taxes resulting from the acquisition or integration of the newly acquired business in the past we have recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions as a result of such factors as significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results missteps or delays in integrating our acquisitions which could be caused by factors outside of our control or our failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions on the timeline we anticipate or at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

depending on the level of our ownership interest in and the extent to which we can exercise control over the acquired business we may be required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and sec rules and regulations to consolidate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements such statements may not be prepared in accordance with gaap or the acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems any of which could materially impair our ability to properly integrate such businesses into our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis any revisions to inaccuracies in or restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to accounting for our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters health and safety epidemics and other business disruptions could cause significant harm to our business operations and facilities and could adversely affect our supply chain and our customer base any of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition 

our us and international manufacturing facilities and distribution centers as well as the operations of our thirdparty suppliers are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods hurricanes earthquakes typhoons volcanic eruptions and similar natural disasters as well as power outages telecommunications failures industrial accidents health and safety epidemics and similar events the occurrence of natural disasters in any of the regions in which we operate could severely disrupt the operations of our businesses by negatively impacting our supply chain our ability to deliver products and the cost of our products such events can negatively impact revenue and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event in addition these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the us and worldwide economies although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms to the extent any losses from natural disasters or other business disruptions are not covered by insurance any costs writedowns impairments and decreased revenue can materially adversely affect our business our results of operations and our financial condition 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates or the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or have exposure to additional tax liabilities which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

changes to or interpretations of tax legislation or regulations in the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities in addition other factors or events including business combinations strategy and investment decisions changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns or as a result of deficiencies asserted by taxing authorities increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes availability of income tax credits and incentives increasing operations in high tax jurisdictions and changes in tax rates could also increase our future effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities 

we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide income tax provision and resulting income tax accrual interpretations of tax legislation or regulations with regard to transactions that occur in or outside the ordinary course of our business may result in uncertainty regarding the final tax determination our tax filings are subject to audit by the internal revenue service the irs and state local and foreign taxing authorities the final determination of an audit may be materially different than the determination which was reflected in our worldwide income tax provision and accrual an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire 

the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting beps project and issued a report in 2015 and an interim report in 2018 and continues to issue guidelines and develop proposals that could change numerous longstanding tax principles including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income the changes arising from the beps 

project if adopted by countries in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies andor legal entity structures which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are therefore subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties there is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our income tax accrual and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our legal organizational structure and the domicile of our entities that own our ip could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition changes in tax legislation future jurisdictional profitability of our subsidiaries and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or income tax accrual we record which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 

our success depends on our ability to attract motivate and retain highly skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel both in the us and internationally in the semiconductor industry the competition for qualified personnel particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees is intense particularly when the business cycle is improving during such periods competitors may try to recruit our most valuable technical employees additionally we have entered into employment agreements with certain senior executives but we do not have employment agreements with most of our employees many of these employees could leave our company with little or no prior notice and would be free to work for a competitor while we devote a great deal of our attention to designing competitive compensation programs aimed at attracting and retaining personnel specific elements of our compensation programs may not be competitive with those of our competitors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require if one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions we may not be able to replace them easily or at all and other senior management may be required to divert attention from other aspects of our business loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and on our business 

the failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our contracts could result in among other things damages fines or other liabilities 

we have a diverse customer base consisting of both private sector clients and public sector clients including the us government sales to our private sector clients are generally based on stated contractual terms the terms and conditions on our website or terms contained in purchase orders on a transactionbytransaction basis sales to our public sector clients are generally derived from sales to federal state and local governmental departments and agencies through various contracts and programs that may require compliance with regulations covering many areas of our operations including but not limited to accounting practices ip rights information handling and security noncompliance with contract terms particularly with respect to highlyregulated public sector clients or with government procurement regulations could result in fines or penalties against us termination of such contracts or civil criminal and administrative liability to the company with respect to public sector clients the government’s remedies may also include suspension or debarment from future government business in addition almost all of our contracts have default provisions and certain of our contracts in the public sector are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency the effect of any of these possible actions or the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations or practices could materially adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

climate change and the regulatory and legislative developments related to climate change may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate these may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and 

intensities water shortages changing sea levels and changing temperatures the impacts of climate change may materially and adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of our operations further any impacts to our business and financial condition as a result of climate change are likely to occur over a sustained period of time and are therefore difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity for example extreme weather events may result in adverse physical effects on portions of our infrastructure which could disrupt our supply chain and ultimately our business operations in addition disruption of transportation and distribution systems could result in reduced operational efficiency and customer service interruption climaterelated events have the potential to disrupt our business including the business of our customers and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to resume operations 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers including costs related to increased energy requirements capital equipment environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be addressed we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete furthermore even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we may be unable to implement our recent business strategy developments which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 

we believe our recent business strategy developments will help us remain competitive however we may face difficulties delays and increased expenses as we transition our business to implement this strategy and may not be able to effectively manage such transitions or efficiently implement this strategy all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations in addition implementation of a new business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations including distracting management from current operations results of operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities and if a strategy is unsuccessful we may not recoup our investments in that strategy failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions or strategies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

we may from time to time desire to exit certain facilities product lines or businesses or to restructure our operations but may not be successful in doing so 

from time to time we may decide to divest certain product lines and businesses or restructure our operations we have in recent years exited several of our product lines and businesses and we have closed several of our manufacturing and research facilities we may continue to do so in the future however our ability to successfully exit product lines and businesses or to close or consolidate operations depends on a number of factors many of which are outside of our control for example if we are seeking a buyer for a particular business line none may be available or we may not be successful in negotiating satisfactory terms with prospective buyers 

our operating results depend in part on the performance of independent distributors 

a portion of our sales occurs through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control we rely on distributors to grow and develop their customer base and anticipate customer needs and any lack of such actions by our distributors may adversely affect our results of operations in particular revenue from one of our distributors accounted for approximately 11 of the company’s total consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 if the business relationship with such distributor is terminated whether through industry consolidation or otherwise and we are unable to find a suitable replacement our operations and operating results could be materially adversely affected these independent distributors also generally represent product lines offered by several companies and are not subject to any minimum sales requirements or obligation to market our products to their customers in turn distributors could reduce their sales efforts for our products or choose to terminate their representation of us additionally we rely on our distributors to provide accurate and timely sales reports in order for us to be able to generate financial reports that accurately represent distributor sales of our products during any given period any inaccuracies or untimely reports could adversely affect our ability to produce accurate and timely financial reports and recognize revenue

executive overview 

this executive overview presents summarized information regarding our business and operating trends only for further information relating to the information summarized herein see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in its entirety 

recent on semiconductor results 

our revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 was 52550 million a decrease of 48 from 55179 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease was attributable to reduced demand for our products across psg asg and isg primarily due to the negative impact from the covid19 pandemic during 2020 while we reported net income attributable to on semiconductor of 2342 million compared to 2117 million in 2019 our operating income during 2020 was 3487 million compared to 4327 million during 2019 while the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the pervasive macroeconomic impacts of the covid19 pandemic the increase in net income attributable to on semiconductor was due to the income tax benefit recorded during the year our gross margin decreased by approximately 310 basis points to 327 in 2020 from 358 in 2019 see discussion under results of operations for further discussion on the reasons for the fluctuations year over year 

business and macroeconomic environment 

the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a significant adverse impact on global economic activity including creating supply chain and market disruption while certain measures enacted in 2020 to contain the spread of the covid19 pandemic have since been relaxed in many jurisdictions the extent to which the pandemic will impact demand for our products depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and longevity of the pandemic and actions to contain and treat its impact 

we historically have pursued and expect to continue to pursue costsaving initiatives to align our overall cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our expected revenue spending and capacity levels based on our current sales and manufacturing projections we have taken and continue to take significant cost containment efforts including but not limited to workforce reductions reducing discretionary spending furloughs and mandatory vacations while all our global 

manufacturing sites are currently operational our facilities could be required to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates there can be no assurances that we will adequately forecast the impact of adverse economic conditions on our business or that we will effectively align our cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our revenue spending and capacity levels in the future 

see note 7 restructuring asset impairments and other charges net in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information relating to our most recent costsaving initiatives 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

in an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees we have taken proactive aggressive actions to adopt social distancing policies at our locations around the world including reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time encouraging our employees to work from home where possible limiting the number of employees attending meetings and significantly reducing employee travel in our role as responsible corporate citizens we have taken actions to support our global communities by providing personal protective equipment to hospitals and health workers we will continue to actively monitor implications of the covid19 pandemic on our business and may take further actions to adjust our business operations if deemed necessary or as required by federal state or local law 

during the majority of 2020 our results of operations were adversely impacted due to the reduced demand from our customers governmentmandated temporary shutdowns of certain of our facilities supply shortages and other logistical constraints arising from the covid19 pandemic however towards the end of 2020 we experienced a meaningful improvement in the demand for most of our products specifically products in the automotive sector that had been significantly impacted by the pandemic however current demand levels have yet to reach levels achieved before the pandemic while we believe that our business has stabilized from the impact of the pandemic a possible resurgence or another wave of the pandemic could alter the business and economic landscape again we expect volatility in demand to continue in varying duration and severity until such time as the covid19 pandemic is effectively contained globally our longterm fundamentals remain strong as we believe that we are wellpositioned for growth as business conditions continue to improve we believe that secular trends in the automotive industrial and cloudpower endmarkets which are our primary areas of focus will continue to drive longterm growth in the semiconductor industry 

results of operations 

our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 includes the full year results and our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 includes partial year results of quantenna which we acquired on june 19 2019

operating results 

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements in millions   



revenue 

revenue was 52550 million and 55179 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease from 2019 to 2020 of 2629 million or 48 w as primarily attributable to a 65 31 and 25 decrease in revenue in psg asg and isg respectively which is further explained below we had one customer a distributor whose revenue accounted for approximately 11 of the total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 

revenue by operating and reportable segments was as follows dollars in millions 



 

1 certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts 

revenue from psg 

revenue from psg decreased by 1822 million or approximately 7 during 2020 compared to 2019 the revenue from our advanced power division and protection and signal division decreased by 1168 million and 491 million respectively the decreases were due to a combination of a general decline in demand for these products due to economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic and was exacerbated by internal delays in fulfilling certain customer orders due to our factories in china the philippines and malaysia which operated at significantly reduced capacity levels during portions of the first half of 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

revenue from asg 

revenue from asg decreased by 619 million or approximately 3 during 2020 compared to 2019 the revenue from our automotive division and mobile computing and cloud division decreased by 474 million and 396 million respectively and was partially offset by an increase in revenue of 341 million in our wireless connectivity solutions division which included the acquired quantenna business the decreases in demand for the products in these divisions was primarily due to the economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic and specifically the automotive industry during the first half of the year which has started to experience a meaningful recovery during the fourth quarter similar to psg this decrease was exacerbated by delays in fulfilling certain customer orders due to our factories in china the philippines and malaysia which operated at a significantly reduced capacity levels during portions of the first half of 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

revenue from isg 

revenue from isg decreased by 188 million or 25 during 2020 compared 2019 which was primarily due to the decrease in revenue from our automotive sensing division of 200 million which was due to decreased demand and delays in fulfilling certain customer orders due to supply chain constraints during the first half of 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic

our gross profit was 17158 million during 2020 compared to 19736 million during 2019 representing a decrease of 2578 million or approximately 13 our gross margin decreased to 327 during 2020 compared to 358 during 2019 the decrease in gross profit and gross margin were attributable to a significant decline in sales volume due to the covid19 pandemic and a decline in average selling prices 

while the improving business conditions during the second half of 2020 positively impacted our gross margins we incurred additional expenses for freight transportation and cleaning costs to operate our facilities in compliance with local government regulations that had an adverse impact on our gross margin 

operating expenses 

research and development 

research and development expenses were 6429 million and 6409 million or approximately 12 of revenue during each of 2020 and 2019 representing an increase of 20 million or approximately 03 yearoveryear while there was a decrease in the cost of external consultants and travelrelated expenses due to the costsaving measures and travel restrictions implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic these decreases were offset due to the payroll expenses for quantenna employees for the entire year in 2020 

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expenses were 2787 million and 3010 million or approximately 5 of revenue during each of 2020 and 2019 representing a decrease of 223 million or approximately 74 yearoveryear the decrease was primarily related to a significant decrease in travelrelated expenses due to the costsaving measures and travel restrictions implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic and nominal decreases in payroll expenses as a result of furloughs and the vsp and involuntary separation program isp offered during 2020 please see note 7 restructuring asset impairments and other charges net in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a more detailed description of the vsp and the isp

other income and expenses 

interest expense 

interest expense increased by 201 million or approximately 14 to 1684 million during 2020 compared to 1483 million in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the outstanding balances of longterm debt as a result of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility which was subsequently repaid and our issuance of the 3875 notes offset partially by the repayment of our 100 notes we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of 382 million and 378 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively our average gross amount of longterm debt balance including current maturities during 2020 and 2019 was 36694 million and 33441 million respectively our weighted average interest rate on our gross amount of longterm debt including current maturities was 46 and 44 per annum in 2020 and 2019 respectively

loss on debt refinancing and prepayment 

we recorded loss on debt refinancing and prepayment of 62 million during 2019 related to the activity under the amended credit agreement no such expenses were incurred during 2020 

other income expense 

other expense decreased by 32 million or approximately 27 from 2019 to 2020 the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of 116 million in actuarial losses on our pension obligations during 2020 compared to 2019 offset by the recognition of an indemnification gain of 78 million primarily attributable to the resolution of a foreign tax dispute and other ip related claims during 2019 

income tax provision 

we recorded an income tax benefit of 598 million and a provision of 627 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2020 consisted of discrete benefits of 630 million primarily due to the recognition of certain deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities related to the domestication of certain foreign subsidiaries and a benefit of 494 million related to the release of valuation allowance against certain state deferred tax assets these benefits were partially offset by a provision of 439 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations a 23 million discrete provision relating to prior year uncertain tax positions a discrete provision of 55 million relating to additional foreign valuation allowance and 09 million of other discrete items 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2019 consisted primarily of 664 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations 60 million relating to the resolution of a foreign tax dispute and 33 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions and 21 million of prior year adjustments these amounts were offset by discrete benefits of 92 million relating to the release of reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions related to prior years and 59 million relating to equity award excess tax benefits

liquidity and capital resources 

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements offbalance sheet arrangements contingencies sources and uses of cash operations working capital and longterm assets and liabilities 

contractual obligations 

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt operating lease liabilities and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2020 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

  



 

1 the table above excludes approximately 451 million of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement of such liabilities 

2 includes interest payments at applicable rates as of december 31 2020 

3 these represent our offbalance sheet arrangements see liquidity and capital resources  offbalance sheet arrangements for further information 

4 during 2019 we incurred additional commitments relating to the pending acquisition of a manufacturing facility of which 1700 million has been deposited with the seller already the remaining commitment of 2300 million will be owed on or around december 31 2022 see note 5 acquisitions divestiture and licensing transactions in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

the table also excludes our pension obligations we expect to make cash contributions to comply with local funding requirements and required benefit payments of approximately 221 million and 70 million respectively in 2021 this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2021 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations see note 12 employee benefit plans in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information on our pension obligations 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 10807 million as of december 31 2020 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash available from our revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund our operating debt repayment and capital needs for at least the next 12 months total cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 include approximately 4891 million available in the united states we require a substantial 

amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt service debt repayments and acquisitions while we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries we have the ability to obtain cash in the united states in order to cover our domestic needs through distributions from our foreign subsidiaries by utilizing existing credit facilities or through new bank loans or debt obligations

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties in connection with certain transactions including but not limited to material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases utilities or customs guarantees as of december 31 2020 our revolving credit facility included 150 million available for the issuance of letters of credit there were 09 million letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 which reduced our borrowing capacity dollarfordollar as of december 31 2020 we also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in the amount of 97 million 

as part of securing financing in the ordinary course of business we have issued guarantees related to certain of our subsidiaries which totaled 09 million as of december 31 2020 based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements for the foreseeable future 

we have not recorded any liability in connection with these letters of credit and guarantee arrangements see note 9 longterm debt and note 13 commitments and contingencies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

contingencies 

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses including but not limited to losses due to ip infringement environmental contamination and other property damage personal injury our failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or our breach of representations warranties or covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in economic damage bodily injury or property damage in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims 

we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities including certain liabilities under the exchange act that might be incurred by any director or officer in his or her capacity as such 

the agreement and plan of merger relating to the acquisition of fairchild semiconductor international inc the fairchild agreement provides for indemnification and insurance rights in favor of fairchild’s then current and former directors officers and employees specifically we have agreed that for no fewer than six years following the fairchild acquisition we will a indemnify and hold harmless each such indemnitee against losses and expenses including advancement of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any proceeding asserted against the indemnified party in connection with such person’s servings as a director officer employee or other fiduciary of fairchild or its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the acquisition b maintain in effect all provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries or any other agreements of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries with any indemnified party regarding elimination of liability indemnification of officers directors and employees and advancement of expenses in existence on the date of the fairchild agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition and c subject to certain qualifications provide to fairchild’s then current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides 

coverage for events occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition that is no less favorable than fairchild’s thenexisting policy or if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable the best available coverage 

similarly the agreement and plan of merger relating to the acquisition of quantenna the quantenna agreement provides for indemnification and insurance rights in favor of quantenna’s then current and former directors officers employees and agents specifically we have agreed that for no fewer than six years following the quantenna acquisition we will a indemnify and hold harmless each such indemnified party to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law in the event of any threatened or actual claim suit action proceeding or investigation against the indemnified party based in whole or in part on or pertaining to such person’s serving as a director officer employee or agent of quantenna or its subsidiaries or predecessors prior to the effective time of the acquisition or in connection with the quantenna agreement b maintain in effect provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of quantenna and each of its subsidiaries regarding the elimination of liability of directors and indemnification of officers directors and employees that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of quantenna and each of its subsidiaries in existence on the date of the quantenna agreement and c obtain and fully pay the premium for a noncancelable extension of directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of quantenna’s directors’ and officers’ policies and quantenna’s fiduciary liability insurance policies in effect as of the date of the quantenna agreement 

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

see note 13 commitments and contingencies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for possible contingencies related to legal matters see also business—government regulation for information on certain environmental matters 

sources and uses of cash 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 10807 million as of december 31 2020 we require cash to fund our operating expenses working capital requirements outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments for debt service including principal and interest for research and development for capital expenditures and to repurchase our common stock as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities on a regular basis during 2019 we entered into an agreement on the pending acquisition of a manufacturing facility and completed the acquisition of quantenna 

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

• geopolitical and macroeconomic factors caused by the covid19 pandemic which has had and is expected to continue to have negative impacts on the economies of the majority of countries and industries while there has been a nominal recovery during the second half of 2020 the ultimate effect of the covid19 pandemic and the responses of various governmental entities and industries thereto the duration and severity and the possibility of the reemergence of the pandemic in future months and the anticipated recovery period is uncertain 

• factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows including the impact on our business and operations as a result of changes in demand for our products including as a result of the covid19 pandemic competitive pricing pressures effective management of our manufacturing capacity our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business and 

• factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise including interest rate fluctuations macroeconomic conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time 

the following are some of the significant sources and uses of cash during 2020 outside of our operating activities and regular capital expenditures 

• borrowing of 11650 million under the revolving credit facility on march 24 2020 and repayment of 12000 million of such borrowings using the net proceeds from the issuance of the 3875 notes and cash on hand on august 21 2020 

• issuance of 7000 million of 3875 notes on august 21 2020 the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

• additional deposit of 1000 million for the pending acquisition of gfus’s east fishkill new york site and fabrication facilities and certain other assets and liabilities on october 5 2020 

• repayment upon maturity of the principal portion of the 100 notes amounting to 6900 million on december 1 2020 

• repayment of 650 million of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility on december 31 2020 

• repurchase of 36 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 653 million under the 2018 share repurchase program 

our ability to service our longterm debt including our 3875 notes 1625 notes revolving credit facility and term loan b facility to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance timing of the full economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic as well as to financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longerterm objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating debt repayment and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next 12 months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

during the ordinary course of business we evaluate our cash requirements and if necessary adjust our expenditures for inventory operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand our capital expenditures are primarily directed towards manufacturing equipment our capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives for example during 2020 we paid approximately 3836 million for capital expenditures while in 2019 we paid approximately 5346 million while our capital expenditures have historically been approximately 6 to 7 of annual revenue we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 7 and 10 of annual revenue in 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of 7 to 8 of revenue in 2021 to further improve our manufacturing cost structure future capital expenditures are expected to be lower however may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted 

as of december 31 2020 there was 16145 million outstanding under the term loan b facility and 7000 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility in addition to the 3875 notes for 7000 million and 1625 notes for 5750 million of which the 1625 notes net of unamortized discount and issuance costs has been reclassified as a current portion of longterm debt the associated interest expense related to this indebtedness will continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations 

see note 5 acquisitions divestiture and licensing transactions and note 9 longterm debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

cash management 

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms for new products 

primary cash flow sources 

our longterm cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash our cash flows from operating activities were 8843 million 6947 million and 12742 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively our operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2020 increased by 1896 million or 273 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 which was primarily due to the payment of 1750 million in 2019 to pi relating to a litigation settlement which decreased our cash flows during 2019 although there was a significant decrease in operating income and income before income taxes in 2020 due to decreased demand for our products as a result of the covid19 pandemic the negative impact on the cash flows provided from operating activities were offset by effective working capital management 

our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on among other factors our success in achieving our 

revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below 

working capital 

working capital calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs in addition our working capital may be affected by acquisitions and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives 

our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of longterm debt was 9605 million as of december 31 2020 and has fluctuated between 8793 million and 10571 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters our working capital including cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of longterm debt was 15096 million as of december 31 2020 and has fluctuated between 10714 million and 23798 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters the significant fluctuation was due to the additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility during 2020 in light of the covid19 pandemic for the year ended december 31 2020 there was not a significant impact to our working capital as we tried to manage our business conservatively in light of the negative impact from the covid19 pandemic 

longterm assets and liabilities 

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets deferred taxes and goodwill our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt and deferred taxes consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans operating lease liabilities and contingent tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions for additional information see note 12 employee benefit plans note 8 balance sheet information and note 16 income taxes in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

key financing and capital events 

overview 

for the past several years we have undertaken various measures to secure liquidity to pursue acquisitions repurchase shares of our common stock reduce interest costs amend existing key financing arrangements and in some cases extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility certain of these measures continued in 2020 set forth below is a summary of certain key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years for further discussion of our debt instruments see note 9 longterm debt and for further discussion on the 2018 share repurchase program and the 2014 share repurchase program as defined below see note 10 earnings per share and equity in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

the 100 notes we concurrently entered into hedge transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the 100 notes and accordingly repurchased an equivalent number of shares of our common stock at fair market value to effectively offset the issuance of shares

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience current and expected future conditions thirdparty evaluations and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following i future payouts for customer incentives and amounts subject to allowances and returns ii valuation and obsolescence relating to inventories iii variable and sharebased compensation and iv measurement of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and evaluations of uncertain tax positions additionally during periods where it becomes applicable significant estimates will be used by management in determining the future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill and in assumptions used in connection with business combinations actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the consolidated financial statements 

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue to a much lesser extent from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled for sales agreements we have identified the promise to transfer products each of which is distinct to be the performance obligation for product development agreements we have identified the completion of a service defined in the agreement to be the performance obligation we apply a fivestep approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized 1 identifying the contract with a customer 2 identifying the performance obligations in the contract 3 determining the transaction price 4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied we allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled substantially all of our revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer 

sales to certain distributors primarily those with ship and credit rights can be subject to price adjustment on certain products we develop an estimate of their expected claims under the ship and credit program based on the historical claims data submitted by product and customer and expected future claims which requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the amount of each claim as well as the historical period used to develop the estimate 

  

our oem customers do not have the right to return products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances ship and credit claims and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue are recognized and are netted against revenue for nonquality related returns we recognize a related asset for the right to recover returned products with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold we record a reserve for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenue based on the experience with each customer 

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected enduser demand the determination of projected enduser demand requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected unit sales for each product these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory that is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved impacting our cost of revenue and gross profit the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded however we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been consistently insignificant and the related impact on our margins has also been insignificant 

variable and sharebased compensation we record compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including rsus and shares issued under the espp and measure them at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and we recognize each such award as an expense over the performance measurement period andor employees requisite service period we have outstanding awards with service performance and marketbased vesting conditions determining the amount of sharebased compensation requires us to develop estimates and use valuation models in calculating the grantdate fair value of the award additionally employees are compensated on a variable basis during periods when we are profitable and certain performance goals are achieved determining the amount of variable compensation expense requires us to estimate future profitability and achievement of performance goals which involves judgment 

income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under this method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

in determining the amount of the valuation allowance estimated future taxable income feasible tax planning strategies future reversals of existing temporary differences and taxable income in prior carryback years if a carryback is permitted are considered if we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 

  

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement no tax benefit is recognized for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made which could have a material impact to our effective tax rate 

business combination we use significant estimates and assumptions in allocating the purchase price of acquired business by utilizing established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology industry to record the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value we utilize the income approach cost approach or market approach depending upon which approach is the most appropriate based on the nature and reliability of available data if the income approach is used the fair value determination is predicated upon the value of the future cash flows that an asset is expected to generate over its economic life and involves significant assumptions as to cash flows associated expenses longterm growth rates and discount rates the cost approach takes into account the cost to replace or reproduce the asset and involves assumptions relating to the assets value of physical functional andor economic obsolescence that has occurred with respect to the asset the market approach is used to estimate value from an analysis of actual transactions or offerings for economically comparable assets available as of the valuation date determining the fair value of acquired technology assets is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including the discount rate revenue growth rates projected gross margins and estimated research and development expenses 

impairment of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable our impairment evaluation consists of a qualitative assessment and if deemed necessary a quantitative test is performed which compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows discount and longterm growth rates we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows the assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenue gross profit operating expenses and industry trends we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and longterm growth rates to use in its analysis we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value 

we are required to test our iprd assets for impairment annually using the guidance for indefinitelived intangible assets our impairment evaluation consists of first assessing qualitative factors and if deemed necessary we calculate the fair value of the iprd asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount exceeds fair value we determine the fair value based on an income approach which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the iprd asset the assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenue gross profit operating expenses and industry trends 

we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding iprd whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount impairment losses if applicable are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests 

contingencies  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading 

purposes 

as of december 31 2020 our gross longterm debt including current maturities totaled 35895 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 27750 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 8145 million balance of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2020 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately 41 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase our interest rate swaps hedge the majority of the risk of variability in cash flows resulting from future interest payments on our variable interest rate debt 

while we have recently begun to observe stabilization in the capital markets impacted by the covid19 pandemic there can be no assurance that equity or borrowings will be available when we access the capital markets again or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 

to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures from an accounting and economic perspective however given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged we cannot provide any assurances that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the us dollar as a normal part of the reporting process some of our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a nonfunctional currency changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged the notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2020 and 2019 was 2634 million and 1833 million respectively our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies including chinese renminbi czech koruna euros japanese yen korean won malaysian ringgit philippine peso and vietnamese dong due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the us dollar for example we determined that based on a hypothetical weightedaverage change of 10 in currency exchange rates our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately 1297 million for the year ended december 31 2020 assuming no offsetting hedge position or correlated activities

raw materials 

  

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers sic wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases as well as other production supplies used in our manufacturing processes we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a justintime basis and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our contractual obligations table in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—contractual obligations included elsewhere in this form 10k from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply increased demand in the industry or other factors 

sales marketing and distribution 

as of december 31 2019 our sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 1800 professionals servicing customers globally we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective global applications support from our technical information centers and solution engineering centers allowing for applications which are developed in one region of the world to be instantaneously available throughout all other regions 

patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights 

  

we market our products primarily under our registered trademark on semiconductor ® and our on logo and in the united states and internationally we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets employee and nondisclosure agreements and licensing agreements to protect our ip we acquired or were licensed or sublicensed to a significant amount of ip including patents and patent applications in connection with our acquisitions and we have numerous us and foreign patents issued allowed and pending as of december 31 2019 we held patents with expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2039 and none of the patents that expire in the next three years materially affect our business our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our ip rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents copyrights and other ip rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 

seasonality 

  

we believe our business today is driven more by content gains within applications and secular growth drivers and not solely by macroeconomic and industry cyclicality as was the case historically as experienced in 2019 we could again experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions for information regarding risks associated with the cyclicality and seasonality of our business see “risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

backlog and inventory 

our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are predominantly booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our edi customers in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times during 2019 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 85 and 87 of actual revenue during such quarter which is consistent with backlog levels in recent prior periods as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases customers tend to order products further in advance and as a result backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenue during such period is likely to increase 

  

in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 

  

we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations we routinely generate inventory based on customers estimates of enduser demand for their products which are difficult to predict see risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business located elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information regarding the inventory practices within the semiconductor industry 

competition 

  

we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because some of our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fullycustomized ics as well as customers who develop their own ic products see risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

  

in comparison several of our competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers the following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

changes in tariffs or other government trade policies may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations including by reducing demand for our products 

the imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions as a result of international trade disputes or changes in trade policies may adversely affect our sales and profitability for example in 2018 and 2019 the us government imposed and proposed among other actions new or higher tariffs on specified imported products originating from china in response to what it characterizes as unfair trade practices and china has responded by imposing and proposing new or higher tariffs on specified products including some semiconductors fabricated in the united states and certain transistors diodes ics and other products that we import into china as part of our supply chain although the united states and china announced an initial “phase one” trade agreement in december 2019 the result of which may roll back or delay the imposition of additional tariffs details have not yet been released and there can be no assurance that a broader trade agreement will be successfully negotiated between the united states and china to reduce or eliminate these tariffs these tariffs and the related geopolitical uncertainty between the united states and china may cause decreased endmarket demand for our products from distributors and other customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for example certain of our foreign customers may respond to the imposition of tariffs or threat of tariffs on products we produce by delaying purchase orders purchasing products from our competitors or developing their own products ongoing international trade disputes and changes in trade policies could also impact economic activity and lead to a general contraction of customer demand in addition tariffs on components that we import from china or other nations that have imposed or may in the future impose tariffs will adversely affect our profitability unless we are able to exclude such components from the tariffs or we raise prices for our products which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors future actions or escalations by either the united states or china that affect trade relations may also impact our business or that of our suppliers or customers and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether such actions will occur or the form that they may take to the extent that our sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

changes in government trade policies could limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the us congress or us regulatory authorities may take administrative legislative or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to make sales to certain of our customers particularly in china we could experience unanticipated restrictions on our ability to sell to certain foreign customers where sales of products and the provision of services may require export licenses or are prohibited by government action export restrictions may also include technical discussions with customers that can impede our ability to pursue designwins with customers and thus may impact future sales for example in may 2019 the us department of commerce added huawei technologies co ltd and its nonus affiliates and subsidiaries and certain other customers to the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security’s entity list imposing significant restrictions on the export and transfer of us goods and technologies to such entities and the us may ban the export of us products goods and technologies to additional foreign customers the terms and duration of any such restrictions may not be known to us in advance and may be subject to ongoing modifications even to the extent such restrictions are subsequently lifted or temporarily suspended any financial or other penalties imposed on affected foreign customers could have a negative impact on future orders such foreign customers may also respond to sanctions or the threat of sanctions by employing their own solutions to address the impacts of restrictions the loss or temporary loss of customers as a result of such future regulatory limitations could materially adversely affect our sales business and results of operations 

downturns or volatility in general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in recent years worldwide semiconductor industry sales have tracked the impact of the financial crisis subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty we believe that the state of global economic conditions is particularly uncertain due to recent and expected shifts in political legislative and regulatory conditions concerning among other matters international trade and taxation and that an uneven recovery or a renewed global downturn may put pressure on our sales due to reductions in customer demand as well as customers deferring purchases volatile or uncertain economic conditions as well as continuing political unrest in markets in which we conduct significant business including hong kong can adversely impact sales and profitability and make it difficult for us and our competitors to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and as a result subject to significant downturns and upturns in customer demand for semiconductors and related products we believe our business today is driven more by secular growth drivers and not solely by macroeconomic and industry cyclicality as was the case historically as experienced in 2019 we could again experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions we cannot accurately predict the timing of future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry or how severe and prolonged these conditions might be significant downturns often occur in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used or declines in general economic conditions and can result in reduced product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results as a result of increased operating expenses outpacing decreased revenue reduced margins underutilization of our manufacturing capacity andor asset impairment charges on the other hand significant upturns can cause us to be unable to satisfy demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in the event of such an upturn we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected we may face oversupply of our products relative to customer demand in the past reduced customer spending has driven us and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which results in a negative effect on gross profit moreover volatility in revenue as a result of unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our shortterm and longterm strategies to the extent that our sales profitability and strategies are negatively affected by downturns or volatility in general economic conditions our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the loss of one of our largest customers or a significant reduction in the revenue we generate from these customers could materially adversely affect our revenue profitability and results of operations 

product sales to our ten largest endcustomers which excludes distributors have historically accounted for a significant amount of our business for instance for the year ended december 31 2019 revenue from our 10 largest endcustomers collectively represented approximately 27 of our total revenue many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that our largest customers will not cease purchasing products from us in favor of products produced by other suppliers significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future and any such event could have a material adverse effect on our revenue profitability and results of operations 

because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the automotive industrial and communications industries a downturn or lower sales to customers in either industry could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

a significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive industrial including medical aerospace and defense and communications industries including wireless and networking sales into these industries represented approximately 33 26 and 19 of our revenue respectively for the year ended december 31 2019 and those percentages will vary from quarter to quarter each of the automotive industrial and communications industries is cyclical and as a result our customers in these industries are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions disruptive innovation and endmarket preferences which can adversely affect sales of our products and correspondingly our results of operations additionally the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in these industries could decline despite continued growth in their respective end markets lower sales to customers in the automotive industrial or communications industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

shortages or increased prices of raw materials could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including various chemicals and gases polysilicon silicon wafers aluminum gold silver copper lead frames mold compound and ceramic packages generally our agreements with suppliers of raw materials impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers of raw materials may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors beyond our control shortages could occur in various essential raw materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner the costs of our raw materials increases significantly their quality deteriorates or they give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

many of our facilities and processes are interdependent and an operational disruption at any particular facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce many of our products which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we utilize an integrated manufacturing platform in which multiple facilities may each produce one or more components necessary for the assembly of a single product as a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities an operational disruption at a facility toward the frontend of our manufacturing process may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products for example our facility in rožnov pod radhoštěm czech republic manufactures silicon wafers used by a number of our facilities and isg relies predominantly on one thirdparty for manufacturing at the frontend of its manufacturing process and any operational disruption natural or manmade disaster or other extraordinary event that impacted either of those facilities would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce a number of our products worldwide in the event of a disruption at any such facility we may be unable to effectively source replacement components on acceptable terms from qualified third parties in which case our ability to produce many of our products could be materially disrupted or delayed conversely many of our facilities are single source facilities that only produce one of our endproducts and a disruption at any such facility would materially delay or cease production of the related product in the event of any such operational disruption we may experience difficulty in beginning production of replacement components or products at new facilities for example due to construction delays or transferring production to other existing facilities for example due to capacity constraints or difficulty in transitioning to new manufacturing processes any of which could result in a loss of future revenues and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if our technologies are subject to claims of infringement on the ip rights of others efforts to address such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may from time to time be subject to claims that we may be infringing the ip rights of others if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such ip rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a thirdparty for ip we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring such technologies further we may be subject to ip litigation which could cause us to incur significant expense materially adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome or pursuant to the terms of a settlement of any such litigation we may be required to 

• pay substantial damages or settlement costs 

• indemnify customers or distributors 

• cease the manufacture use sale or importation of infringing products 

• expend significant resources to develop or acquire noninfringing technologies 

• discontinue the use of processes or 

• obtain licenses which may not be available on reasonable terms to the infringing technologies 

please see note 13 commitments and contingencies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a more detailed description of the litigation we are currently engaged in the outcome of ip litigation is inherently uncertain and if not resolved in our favor could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to protect the ip we use our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the enforceability of our patents trademarks copyrights software licenses and other ip is uncertain in certain circumstances effective ip protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the us and internationally the various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered ip assets patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts with respect to our ip generally we cannot assure you that 

• any of the substantial number of us or foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated circumvented challenged abandoned or licensed to others 

• any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought 

• any of the trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow or mask works that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated circumvented challenged abandoned or licensed to others 

• any of our pending or future trademark copyright or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought or 

• that we will be able to successfully enforce our ip rights in the us or foreign countries 

when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights of its own against us which may materially adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications we seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to ip arising out of our research should we be unable to protect our ip competitors may develop products or technologies that duplicate our products or technologies benefit financially from innovations for which we bore the costs of development and undercut the sales and marketing of our products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to identify and make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process and often requires significant capital investment and lead time for development and testing we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive in addition the lengthy development cycle for our products limits our ability to adapt quickly to changes affecting the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and we may be unable to develop innovative responses to our customers’ and endusers’ evolving needs on the timelines they require or at all there can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” for new products in addition design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or that we will generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments as expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured there is no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop new products that a significant investment in new products will be profitable or that we will have margins as high as we anticipate at the time of investment or have experienced historically to the extent that we underinvest in our research and development efforts fail to recognize the need for innovation with respect to our products or that our investments and capital expenditures in research and development do not lead to sales of new products we may be unable to bring to market technologies and products that are attractive to our customers and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts often in markets or regions in which we have less experience than others our decision to pursue an acquisition is based on among other factors our estimates of expected future earnings growth and potential cost savings for example we may anticipate rationalization of a combined infrastructure and savings through integration of a newly acquired business into our business and our estimates could turn out to be incorrect risks related to successful integration of an acquisition include but are not limited to 1 the ability to integrate information technology and other systems 2 unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence 3 customers responding by changing their existing business relationships with us or the acquired company 4 diversion of management’s attention from our day to day operations and 5 loss of key employees due to uncertainty about positions postintegration in addition we may incur unexpected costs such as operating or restructuring costs including severance payments to departing employees or taxes resulting from the acquisition or integration of the newly acquired business in the past we have recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions as a result of such factors as significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results missteps or delays in integrating our acquisitions which could be caused by factors outside of our control or our failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions on the timeline we anticipate or at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

depending on the level of our ownership interest in and the extent to which we can exercise control over the acquired business we may be required by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and sec rules and regulations to consolidate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements such statements may not be prepared in accordance with gaap or the acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems any of which could materially impair our ability to properly integrate such businesses into our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis any revisions to inaccuracies in or restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to accounting for our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain manufacturing efficiency which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing requires advanced equipment and significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs which include depreciation expense manufacturing semiconductor components also involves highly complex processes that we and our competitors are continuously modifying to improve yields and product performance in addition impurities waste or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower production yields our manufacturing efficiency is 

and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or be successful in our manufacturing rationalization plans if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at expected levels or if production capacity increases while revenue does not the fixed costs and other operating expenses associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the failure to successfully implement cost reduction initiatives including through restructuring activities could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

from time to time we have implemented cost reduction initiatives in response to significant downturns in our industry including relocating manufacturing to lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to lower costs implementing personnel reductions and voluntary retirement programs reducing employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in addition we continuously monitor productivity and capital expenditures at our facilities in order to make strategic determinations regarding the temporary or permanent shutdown or disposition of facilities to improve our cost structure in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs have been primarily composed of employee separation costs including severance payments and asset impairments we also often undertake restructuring activities and programs to improve our cost structure in connection with our business acquisitions which can result in significant charges including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges 

we cannot assure you that our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business including but not limited to the location of our production facilities and personnel the associated cost reductions could materially adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position to the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other benefits of our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives that we anticipate our results of operations may be materially adversely effected 

we may be unable to develop new products to satisfy changing customer demands or regulatory requirements which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving regulatory and industry standards and certifications changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions our success is largely dependent on our ability to accurately predict identify and adapt to changes affecting the requirements of our customers in a timely and costeffective manner additionally the emergence of new industry or regulatory standards and certification requirements may adversely affect the demand for our products we focus our independent new product development efforts on market segments and applications that we anticipate will experience growth but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying highgrowth areas or develop products that meet industry standards or certification requirements in a timely manner a fundamental shift in technologies the regulatory climate or consumption patterns and preferences in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could make our current products obsolete prevent or delay the introduction of new products that we planned to make or render our current or new products irrelevant to our customers’ needs if our new product development efforts fail to align with the needs of our customers including due to circumstances outside of our control like a fundamental shift in the product markets of our customers and end users or regulatory changes our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

uncertainties regarding the timing and amount of customer orders could lead to excess inventory and writedowns of inventory that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers requiring a commitment to purchase our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and generally prior to start of production for custom products without incurring a penalty we routinely generate inventory based on customers’ estimates of enduser demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties which may vary significantly in times of under supply for certain products some customers could respond by inflating their demand signals as 

markets level off and supply capacity begins to match actual market demands we could experience an increased risk of inventory writedowns which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction of products due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers unsold inventory canceled orders and cancellation penalties may materially adversely affect our results of operations and inventory writedowns which may materially adversely affect our financial condition 

if we do not have access to capital on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

we require a substantial amount of capital to meet our operating requirements and remain competitive we routinely incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency to upgrade equipment and to expand production capacity and there can be no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended we have incurred and may continue to incur material amounts of debt to fund these requirements significant volatility or disruption in the global financial markets may result in us not being able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all and we may not be able to refinance if necessary any outstanding debt when due all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition any inability to obtain additional funding on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all may cause us to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or obtain funds through arrangements that management does not currently anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies the occurrence of any of which may significantly impair our ability to remain competitive if our operating results falter our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fully customized ics as well as from customers who develop their own ic products in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

our inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations products or technologies developed by competitors that are larger and have more substantial research and development budgets or that are smaller and more targeted in their development efforts may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive we also may be unable to market and sell our products if they are not competitive on the basis of price quality technical performance features system compatibility customized design innovation availability delivery timing and reliability if we fail to compete effectively on developing strategic relationships with customers and customer sales and technical support our sales and revenue may be materially adversely affected competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise prices and any inability to maintain revenue or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a significant adverse effect on our gross margin reduced sales and lower gross margins would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry has experienced rapid consolidation and our inability to compete with large competitors or failure to identify attractive opportunities to consolidate may materially adversely affect our business 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by the high costs associated with developing marketable products and manufacturing technologies as well as high levels of investment in production capabilities as a result the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including but not limited to substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition in addition we may be at a competitive disadvantage to our peers if we fail to identify attractive opportunities to acquire companies to expand our business consolidation among our competitors and integration among our customers could erode our market share negatively impact 

our capacity to compete and require us to restructure our operations any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

natural disasters health and safety epidemics and other business disruptions could cause significant harm to our business operations and facilities and could adversely affect our supply chain and our customer base any of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition 

our us and international manufacturing facilities and distribution centers as well as the operations of our thirdparty suppliers are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods hurricanes earthquakes typhoons and similar natural disasters as well as power outages telecommunications failures industrial accidents health and safety epidemics and similar events the occurrence of natural disasters in any of the regions in which we operate could severely disrupt the operations of our businesses by negatively impacting our supply chain our ability to deliver products and the cost of our products for example as a result of the outbreak of the coronavirus in the first quarter of 2020 we andor certain of our third party vendors may experience decreased production in our facilities in china and elsewhere which may lead to interruptions in our supply chain delays in delivery of or inability to deliver products on expected timeframes or at all andor loss of customers such events can negatively impact revenue and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event in addition these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the us and worldwide economies although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms to the extent any losses from natural disasters or other business disruptions are not covered by insurance any costs writedowns impairments and decreased revenue can materially adversely affect our business our results of operations and our financial condition 

we are dependent on the services of thirdparty suppliers and contract manufacturers and any disruption in or deterioration of the quality of the services delivered by such third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use thirdparty contractors for certain of our manufacturing activities primarily wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to commit to purchase services based on forecasted product needs which may be inaccurate and in some cases require longerterm commitments we are also dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized thirdparty suppliers for required components and materials for certain of our key technologies arranging for replacement manufacturers and suppliers can be time consuming and costly and the number of qualified alternative providers can be extremely limited our business operations productivity and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasted needs proved to be materially incorrect 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates or the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or have exposure to additional tax liabilities which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

changes to tax or other applicable laws or regulations in the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws or regulations could under our existing tax structure significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities result in us having to restructure and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition other factors or events including business combinations and investment transactions changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns or as a result of deficiencies asserted by taxing authorities increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in available tax credits increasing operations in high tax jurisdictions and changes in tax rates could also increase our future effective tax rate 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service the irs and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project that was undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles the changes arising from the beps project if adopted by countries in which we do business could increase tax uncertainty and may 

adversely affect our provision for income taxes which could ultimately materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the impact of us tax legislation is uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation hr1 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code some of the changes still require additional guidance including through the issuance of final treasury regulations which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the tax act our analysis and interpretation of the tax act and proposed treasury regulations are ongoing and may include judgments and interpretations that could change based on final treasury regulations or other guidance or due to actions that the company may take in response to such regulatory change as a result the impact of the tax act on our results of operations and cash flows may differ from our estimates possibly materially 

the tax act could have a material benefit or material adverse impact and could result in volatility in our effective tax rate tax expense and cash flow any benefit associated with the lower us corporate tax rate could be reduced or outweighed by the cost of compliance or other adverse regulatory changes related to the tax act or final treasury regulations 

we operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies andor legal entity structures which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are therefore subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties there is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results or operations and cash flows 

our legal organizational structure and the domicile of our entities that own our ip could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes in laws regulations future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in us becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

currency fluctuations changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sizeable sales and operations in the asiapacific region and europe and a significant amount of this business is transacted in currency other than us dollars in addition while a significant percentage of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside the us many of our liabilities including our outstanding indebtedness and certain other cash payments such as share repurchases are payable in us dollars as a result currency fluctuations and changes in foreign exchange regulations can have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

in addition repatriation of funds held outside the us could have adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay due to required local country approvals or local obligations from time to time we are required to make cash deposits outside of the us to support bank guarantees of our obligations under certain office leases or amounts we owe to certain vendors and such cash deposits are not available for other uses as long as the related bank guarantees are outstanding foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency as a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the us our financial flexibility may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations restrictions on repatriation or the inability to use cash held abroad to fund our operations in the us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

rapid innovation and short product life cycles in the semiconductor industry can result in price erosion of older products which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid innovation and short product life cycles which often results in price erosion especially with respect to products containing older technology products are frequently replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes and as demand for older technology falls the price at which such products can be sold drops in some cases precipitously in addition our and our competitors’ excess inventory levels can accelerate general price erosion 

in order to continue to profitably supply older products we must offset lower prices by reducing production costs typically through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies if we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our production efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of older products moreover in certain limited cases we may not be able to cease production of older products either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products for a sustained period of time if reductions in our production costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 

our success depends on our ability to attract motivate and retain highly skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel both in the us and internationally in the semiconductor industry the competition for qualified personnel particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees is intense particularly when the business cycle is improving during such periods competitors may try to recruit our most valuable technical employees while we devote a great deal of our attention to designing competitive compensation programs aimed at attracting and retaining personnel specific elements of our compensation programs may not be competitive with those of our competitors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and on our business 

if we must reduce our use of equity awards to compensate our employees our competitiveness in the employee marketplace could be adversely affected and our results of operations could vary as a result of changes in our stockbased compensation programs 

we have issued in the past and expect to continue to issue rsus with timebased vesting performancebased awards and common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time as compensation tools while this is a routine practice in many parts of the world foreign exchange and income tax regulations in some countries make this practice more and more difficult such regulations tend to diminish the value of equity compensation to our employees in those countries our current practice is to seek stockholder approval of new or amendments to existing equity compensation plans if these proposals do not receive stockholder approval we may not be able to grant equity awards to employees at the same levels as in the past which could materially adversely affect our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel thereby materially adversely affecting our business in addition changes in forecasted stockbased compensation expense could cause our results of operations to vary by impacting our gross margin percentage research and development expenses marketing general and administrative expenses and our tax rate 

disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could materially harm our business and reputation 

labor disputes could lead to disruption from time to time in our union and nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to production slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in a loss of business and material damage to our reputation in addition union activity and compliance with international labor standards could result in higher labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

environmental and health and safety liabilities and expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations for example our manufacturing operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground and we have been identified as either a primary responsible party or a potentially responsible party at sites where we or our predecessors operated or disposed of waste in the 

past our other operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other requirements regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances we have indemnities from third parties for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities for periods prior to our operations at some of our current and past sites and we have also purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance will cover any or all of our material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities including 

• changes in us and international environmental or health and safety laws or regulations including but not limited to future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns 

• the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced administered or interpreted 

• our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities 

• the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims including the cost of cleanup of currently unknown environmental conditions or 

• the cost of fines penalties or other legal liability should we fail to comply with environmental or health and safety laws or regulations 

to the extent that we face unforeseen environmental or health and safety compliance costs or remediation expenses or liabilities that are not covered by indemnities or insurance we may bear the full effect of such costs expense and liabilities which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards 

like most publicly traded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm as we continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future 

there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future failure to comply with sox including delaying or failing to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such transactions and the trading price of our common stock or other securities may decline in addition if we fail to remedy any material weakness our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements our financial statements may be materially inaccurate our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process requiring production in a tightly controlled clean environment minute impurities in our manufacturing materials contaminants in the manufacturing environment manufacturing equipment failures and other defects can cause our products to be noncompliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in electrical design oems are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage if any and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall could have material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell 

our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them and claims for consequential damages against our customers from their customers we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenue and profits we receive from the products involved in certain instances we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective and to the extent that we are liable for damages in excess of the revenue and profits we received from the products involved our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could irreparably damage our reputation and our business expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we routinely collect and store sensitive data including confidential and other proprietary information about our business and our customers suppliers and business partners the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses illegal hacking criminal fraud or impersonation acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error our security measures andor those of our thirdparty service providers andor customers may not detect or prevent such security breaches the costs to us to reduce the risk of or alleviate cyber security breaches and vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may materially impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions any such compromise of our information security could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business an interruption in our operations the unauthorized transfer of cash or other of our assets the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws in addition computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities and any such attack if successful could expose us to liability to customer claims any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

sales through distributors and other third parties expose us to risks that if realized could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face risks related to our sale of a significant and increasing portion of our products through distributors distributors may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the fcpa or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our contracts could result in among other things damages fines or other liabilities 

we have a diverse customer base consisting of both private sector clients and public sector clients including the us government sales to our private sector clients are generally based on stated contractual terms the terms and conditions on our website or terms contained in purchase orders on a transactionbytransaction basis sales to our public sector clients are generally derived from sales to federal state and local governmental departments and agencies through various contracts and programs which may require compliance with regulations covering many areas of our operations including but not limited to accounting practices ip rights information handling and security noncompliance with contract terms particularly with respect to highlyregulated public sector clients or with government procurement regulations could result in fines or penalties against us termination of such contracts or civil criminal and administrative liability to the company with respect to public sector clients the government’s remedies may also include suspension or debarment from future government business in addition almost all of our contracts have default provisions and certain of our contracts in the public sector are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency the effect of any of these possible actions or the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations or practices could materially adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

the company is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future the company collects personally identifiable information “pii” and other data as part of its business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union and other relevant jurisdictions where the company conducts business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are currently more restrictive than those in the us additionally in may 2016 the european union adopted the general data protection regulation that imposed more stringent data protection requirements and provided for greater penalties for noncompliance beginning in may 2018 in addition among other applicable laws california adopted significant new consumer privacy laws in june 2018 that became effective on january 1 2020 and thailand adopted the personal data protection act be 2562 in may 2019 in addition from time to time our global operations may require importing exporting or transferring data across international borders in compliance with both us customs and export control regulations including the export administration regulations and the international traffic in arms regulations any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or to comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to the company or company officials including substantial monetary fines and could damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business 

expectations of the company relating to environmental social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks 

there is an increasing focus from certain investors employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate social responsibility csr specifically related to environmental social and governance factors some investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and in some cases may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to csr are inadequate thirdparty providers of csr ratings and reports on companies have increased to meet growing investor demand for measurement of csr performance in addition the criteria by which companies’ csr practices are assessed may change which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria alternatively if we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria investors may conclude that our policies with respect to csr are inadequate we may face reputational damage in the event that our csr procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies furthermore if our competitors’ csr performance is perceived to be greater than ours potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead in addition in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental social and governance matters we could fail or be perceived to fail in our achievement of such initiatives or goals or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals if we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors employees and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned our reputation and financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

climate change and the regulatory and legislative developments related to climate change may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate these may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities water shortages changing sea levels and changing temperatures the impacts of climate change may materially and adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of our operations further any impacts to our business and financial condition as a result of climate change are likely to occur over a sustained period of time and are therefore difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity for example extreme weather events may result in adverse physical effects on portions of our infrastructure which could disrupt our supply chain and ultimately our business operations in addition disruption of transportation and distribution systems could result in reduced operational efficiency and customer service interruption climaterelated events have the potential to disrupt our business including the business of our customers and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to resume operations 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers including costs related to increased energy requirements capital equipment environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be addressed we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete furthermore even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity 

in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial debt could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2019 we had 37492 million of outstanding indebtedness we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future to repay or refinance other outstanding debt to make acquisitions or for other purposes and if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

• our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 

• the timing amount and execution of our capital allocation policy including our 2018 share repurchase program could be affected by the degree to which we are leveraged 

• a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt which reduces the funds available to us for our operations and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests 

• some of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates 

• our debt agreements may contain and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain financial and restrictive covenants and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on us 

• our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to and reduce our flexibility to respond to general economic downturns and adverse industry and business conditions 

• as our longterm debt ages we must repay and may need to renegotiate such debt or seek additional financing 

• to the extent the debt we incur requires collateral to secure such indebtedness our assets could be at risk and our flexibility related to such assets could be limited 

• our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the semiconductor industry 

• our substantial leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage visàvis our competitors who may have less leverage relative to their overall capital structures and 

• our level of indebtedness may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors 

to the extent that we continue to maintain or expand our significant indebtedness our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the inability to meet our obligations under our amended credit agreement could materially and adversely affect us by among other things limiting our ability to conduct our operations and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

our amended credit agreement provides for our 197 billion revolving credit facility and our 24 billion term loan “b” facility the proceeds of which have been used among other things to fund acquisitions the obligations under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the personal property and material real property assets of the company and most of the company’s domestic subsidiaries as a result if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the amended credit agreement the lenders could take possession of and foreclose on the pledged collateral securing the indebtedness in which case we would be at risk of losing the related collateral which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations in addition subject to customary exceptions the amended credit agreement requires mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances which may result in prepaying outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility and the term loan “b” facility rather than using funds for other business purposes our acquisitionrelated financing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition including among other things our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and could reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

the agreements relating to our indebtedness including the amended credit agreement may restrict our ability to operate our business and as a result may materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our debt agreements including the amended credit agreement contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to 

• incur additional debt including issuing guarantees 

• incur liens 

• make certain investments 

• settle a conversion of our 100 and 1625 notes in whole or in part with cash 

• sell or otherwise dispose of assets 

• make some acquisitions 

• engage in mergers or consolidations or certain other “change of control” transactions 

• make distributions to our stockholders 

• engage in restructuring activities 

• engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions and 

• issue or repurchase stock or other securities 

such agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them to the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations our financial condition may be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us to the extent that we are unable to engage in activities that support the growth profitability and competitiveness of our business our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations and any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations as they come due we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect furthermore we cannot assure you that if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness which could materially negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition a default under our committed credit facilities including our amended credit agreement could also limit our ability to make further borrowings under those facilities which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to the current stockholders 

an event of default under any agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness could cross default other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if there were an event of default under certain of our agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness any such cross default would put immediate pressure on our liquidity and financial condition and would amplify the risks described above with regards to being unable to repay our indebtedness when due and payable we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our operating subsidiaries which may have no independent obligation to repay our debt are not able to make cash available to us for such repayment our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if interest rates increase our debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could increase significantly which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

borrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time including under our amended credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and as a result expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease during the first quarters of 2017 and 2019 we entered into interest rate swaps that involved the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility for a portion of our term loan b facility through the end of 2021 however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk to the extent the risk materializes and is not fully mitigated the resulting increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a number of our current debt agreements including the amended credit agreement have an interest rate tied to libo rate which is expected to be discontinued after 2021 while some of our debt agreements provide procedures for determining an alternative base rate in the event that libo rate is discontinued not all do so regardless there can be no assurances as to what alternative base rates may be and whether such base rate will be more or less favorable than libo rate and any other unforeseen impacts of the potential discontinuation of libo rate the company intends to monitor the developments with respect to the potential phasing out of libo rate after 2021 and work with its lenders to ensure any transition away from libo rate will have minimal impact on its financial condition but can provide no assurances that the impact of the discontinuation of libo rate would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

servicing the 100 notes and 1625 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 100 notes and 1625 notes in a timely manner 

in june 2015 we issued 6900 million aggregate principal amount of our 100 notes and in march 2017 we issued 5750 million aggregate principal amount of our 1625 notes holders of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined under the respective indentures governing such notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change repurchase date in addition upon conversion of the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes to be repurchased unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares we will be required to make cash payments in respect of such 100 notes andor 1625 notes being converted moreover we will be required to repay the 100 notes and the 1625 notes in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted or repurchased servicing the 100 notes and the1625 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 100 notes and the 1625 notes our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes repurchase the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes in the event of a fundamental change or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would dilute existing stockholders in addition if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of such notes which could cross default other debt and materially adversely harm our business the terms of the amended credit agreement limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur but the terms of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the 

risks described above our decision to use our cash for other purposes such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock could also intensify these risks 

the conditional conversion feature of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and if we elect to settle the conversion of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes in common stock any such settlement could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

if specified conditions are met holders of the 100 notes may convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding september 1 2020 and holders of the 1625 notes may convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding july 15 2023 unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligations by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares in the event the conditional conversion feature under either the 100 notes or the 1625 notes is triggered holders electing to convert their notes could require us to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligations through the payment of cash which could materially adversely affect our liquidity alternatively if the conditional conversion feature under either the 100 notes or the 1625 notes is triggered and holders do not elect to convert their notes we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of such notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital any material decrease in our liquidity or reduction in our net working capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may elect to settle a conversion of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes solely in common stock to avoid an event of default under our amended credit agreement and any such issuance of common stock could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders including stockholders who previously converted such notes to shares of our common stock 

the fundamental change repurchase feature of our 100 notes and 1625 notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company 

the terms of our 100 notes and 1625 notes require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined under the respective indentures governing such notes in certain circumstances a takeover of our company could trigger an option of the holders of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes to require us to repurchase such notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors in the 100 notes and the 1625 notes and our common stock which could materially decrease the value of such notes and of our common stock 

note hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

concurrently with the issuance of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions which we refer to as the option counterparties the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the respective series of notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes of such series as the case may be we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds 2596 with respect to the 100 notes and 3070 with respect to the 1625 notes which would trigger the conditional conversion feature under such notes for example in the first quarter of 2018 the conditional conversion feature was triggered with respect to the 100 notes as a result of which holders were permitted to convert their 100 notes into shares of common stock cash or a combination thereof at our election for a threemonth period we can provide no assurance as to when or whether these conditional conversion features will be triggered again in the future 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock andor entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock following the pricing of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes respectively the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes respectively and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 100 notes or 1625 notes following any repurchase of the 100 notes or 1625 notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions if realized could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we are subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral if one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions 

to the extent the option counterparties do not honor their contractual commitments with us pursuant to the note hedge transactions we could face a material increase in our exposure to potential dilution upon any conversion of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes andor cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 100 notes or 1625 notes as the case may be our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock in addition upon a default by one of the option counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences with respect to our common stock any such adverse tax consequences or increased cash payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability and unexpected changes may impact the value of our common stock a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter in addition to the other factors described above factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

• the timing and size of orders from our customers including cancellations and reschedulings 

• the timing of introduction of new products 

• the gain or loss of significant customers including as a result of industry consolidation or as a result of our acquisitions 

• seasonality in some of our target markets 

• changes in the mix of products we sell 

• changes in demand by the endusers of our customers’ products 

• market acceptance of our current and future products 

• variability of our customers’ product life cycles 

• availability of supplies and manufacturing services 

• changes in manufacturing yields or other factors affecting the cost of goods sold such as the cost and availability of raw materials and the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity 

• changes in the prices of our products which can be affected by the level of our customers’ and endusers’ demand technological change product obsolescence competition or other factors 

• cancellations changes or delays of deliveries to us by our thirdparty manufacturers including as a result of the availability of manufacturing capacity and the proposed terms of manufacturing arrangements 

• our liquidity and access to capital and 

• our research and development activities and the funding thereof 

an adverse change or development in any of the above factors could cause the market price of common stock to materially decline 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors 

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors among others some of which are beyond our control 

• variations in our quarterly operating results 

• declines in our gross margins 

• the issuance or repurchase of shares of our common stock 

• changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our financial performance 

• changes in market valuations of similar companies 

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures capital commitments new products or product enhancements 

• loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions and 

• additions or departures of key personnel 

the trading price of our common stock in the past has had significant volatility and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a thirdparty to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

• establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting 

• authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock which is preferred stock that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval and that could be issued with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and 

• require the approval by holders of at least 66 23 of our outstanding common stock to amend any of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders any delay or prevention of an acquisition of our company that would have been beneficial to our stockholders could materially decrease the value of our common stock

executive overview 

this executive overview presents summarized information regarding our industry markets business and operating trends only for further information relating to the information summarized herein see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in its entirety 

industry overview 

according to wsts an industry research firm worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 4121 billion in 2019 a decrease of approximately 121 from 4688 billion in 2018 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and to track our progress against the market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenue since 2015 



 

1 based on shipment information published by wsts we believe the data provided by wsts is reliable but we have not independently verified it wsts periodically revises its information we assume no obligation to update such information 

as indicated above worldwide semiconductor sales increased from 3352 billion in 2015 to 4121 billion in 2019 the decrease of 121 from 2018 to 2019 was the result of decreased demand for semiconductor products our revenue decreased by 3604 million or 61 from 2018 to 2019 

on semiconductor overview 

  

our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in product areas that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple highgrowth applications we collaborate with our customers to identify desired innovations in electronic systems in each endmarket that we serve this enables us to participate in the fastest growing sectors of the market we also innovate in advanced packaging technologies to support ongoing size reduction in electronic systems and in advanced thermal packaging to support high performance power conversion applications it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of highgrowth technologies we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to facilitate continued growth by targeting innovative products and solutions for high growth applications that position us to outperform the industry our design expertise in analog digital mixed signal and imaging ics combined with our extensive portfolio of standard products enable the company to offer comprehensive valueadded solutions to our global customers for their electronics systems 

we believe that some of the key factors and trends affecting our current and future results of operations include but not limited to 

• macroeconomic conditions affecting the semiconductor industry 

• the cyclicality and seasonality of the semiconductor industry 

• the global economic climate 

• our significant indebtedness including the indebtedness incurred for the acquisition of fairchild and quantenna 

• the impact of us corporate tax reform and an uncertain corporate tax environment abroad 

• an uncertain political climate and related impacts on global trade such as tariffs on imports into the us from china 

• the effects of trends in the automotive and industrial endmarkets on our revenue 

• competitive conditions and in particular consolidation within our industry and 

• underutilization of installed capacity and competitive pricing environment 

acquisition of quantenna 

on june 19 2019 we completed our acquisition of quantenna pursuant to the definitive agreement and plan of merger with each of quantenna and raptor operations sub inc our whollyowned subsidiary “raptor” which provided for the merger of quantenna with raptor whereby quantenna continued as the surviving corporation and our whollyowned subsidiary following the acquisition quantenna changed its name to on semiconductor connectivity solutions inc the purchase price totaled 10393 million of which 10266 million was paid through december 31 2019 with the proceeds from a 9000 million draw against our revolving credit facility and cash on hand we believe the acquisition of quantenna creates a strong platform for addressing connectivity solutions for industrial iot by combining our expertise in power management and bluetooth technologies with quantennas wifi technologies and software capabilities 

recent on semiconductor results 

our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 was 55179 million a decrease of 61 from 58783 million from the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced demand for our products across psg asg and isg during 2019 we reported net income attributable to on semiconductor of 2117 million compared to 6274 million in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to the impact of reduced demand and a onetime litigation settlement charge our gross margin decreased by approximately 230 basis points to 358 in 2019 from 381 in 2018 the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a competitive pricing environment and decreased demand for our products 

business and macroeconomic environment influence on cost savings and restructuring activities 

the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions and may experience significant uncertainty and volatility in the future we believe our business today is driven more by secular growth drivers and not solely by macroeconomic and industry cyclicality as was the case historically as experienced in 2019 we could again experience periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

during the year ended december 31 2019 geopolitical and macroeconomic factors continued to adversely impact product demand in the semiconductor industry in light of these factors we expect that such demand for our products could be adversely affected in the shortterm we also believe however that secular megatrends in the automotive industrial and cloudpower endmarkets will continue to drive longterm growth in the semiconductor industry 

in response to the above industry trends we are investing and taking other measures to further strengthen our position in the automotive industrial and cloudpower endmarkets in an effort to mitigate adverse demand trends in the semiconductor industry we have historically pursued and expect to continue to pursue costsaving initiatives to align our overall cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our expected revenue spending and capacity levels based on our current sales and manufacturing projections we have recognized efficiencies from previously implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure we have historically taken significant actions to align our overall cost structure with our expectations of market conditions by focusing on synergiesrelated cost reductions arising from each of our acquisitions however there can be no assurances that we will adequately forecast economic conditions or that we will effectively align our cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our revenue spending and capacity levels in the future 

see note 7 restructuring asset impairments and other charges net in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information relating to our most recent costsaving initiatives

revenue by reportable segment for each were as follows dollars in millions 



 

1 certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts 

revenue from psg 

revenue from psg decreased by 2499 million or approximately 8 which was due to a combination of a decrease in volume of products sold and a competitive pricing environment the revenue in our protection and signal division integrated circuits division and high power division decreased by 1065 million 966 million and 915 million respectively this was partially offset by an increase in revenue of 301 million and 150 million from our foundry services and power mosfet division respectively 

revenue from asg 

revenue from asg decreased by 989 million or approximately 5 which was also due to a combination of a decrease in volume of products sold and a competitive pricing environment the revenue in our industrial and offline power division and our signal processing wireless and medical division decreased by 1005 million and 564 million respectively this was partially offset by 848 million of revenue from quantenna which was acquired during 2019 

revenue from isg 

revenue from isg decreased by 116 million or 15 which was due to a decrease in our industrial sensing division revenue of 208 million primarily due to decreased demand which was partially offset by an increase in revenue in other divisions 

revenue by geographic location 

revenue by geographic location including local sales made by operations within each area based on sales billed from the respective country are as follows dollars in millions   



 

1 certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts

2 unallocated manufacturing costs are presented as a percentage of total revenue includes expensing of the fair market value stepup of inventory of 196 million during 2019 and 10 million during 2018 

the decrease in gross profit of 2651 million or approximately 12 was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in sales volume higher fixed costs due to the expansion in our manufacturing capacity as well as the expensing of 196 million excess over book value of inventory commonly referred to as the fair market value stepup from the quantenna acquisition 

gross margin decreased to 358 during 2019 compared to 381 during 2018 the decrease was due to a competitive pricing environment resulting in a decline in average selling prices higher demand for lower margin products increased manufacturing costs due to a higher mix of external manufacturing and decreased demand for our products as explained in the revenue section 

operating expenses 

research and development 

research and development expenses were 6409 million and 6507 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively representing approximately 12 of revenue in 2019 and 11 of revenue for 2018 the decrease in research and development expenses of 98 million or approximately 2 was primarily related to a decrease in variable compensation in 2019 which was partially offset by expenses in quantenna 

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expenses were 3010 million and 3247 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively representing approximately 5 of revenue in 2019 and 6 of revenue in 2018 the decrease in selling and marketing expenses of 237 million or approximately 7 was primarily related to a decrease in variable compensation in 2019 which was partially offset by expenses in quantenna 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses were 2840 million and 2933 million representing approximately 5 of revenue for 2019 and 2018 respectively the decrease in general and administrative expenses of 93 million or approximately 3 was due to a decrease in variable compensation in 2019 which was partially offset by an increase in acquisitionrelated expenses and the expenses in quantenna

see note 6 goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

other income and expenses 

interest expense 

interest expense increased by 201 million or approximately 16 to 1483 million during 2019 compared to 1282 million in 2018 primarily due to an increase in the outstanding longterm debt balance incurred relating to the acquisition of quantenna we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of 378 million and 361 million for 2019 and 2018 respectively our average gross amount of longterm debt balance including current maturities during 2019 and 2018 was 33441 million and 30570 million respectively our weighted average interest rate on our gross amount of longterm 

debt including current maturities was 44 and 42 per annum in 2019 and 2018 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources—key financing and capital events” below and note 9 longterm debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a description of our indebtedness and our refinancing activities

see note 9 longterm debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

gain on divestiture of business 

gain on divestiture of business was zero in 2019 compared to 50 million for 2018 during 2018 we divested the transient voltage suppressing diodes business we acquired from fairchild to tsc america inc and recorded a gain of 46 million for additional information see note 5 acquisitions divestitures and licensing transactions in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

licensing income 

licensing income was zero in 2019 compared to 366 million for 2018 the 2018 licensing income was primarily due to the achievement of the established criteria based on which income was recognized under the various licensing agreements we completed recognizing all licensing income under existing agreements as of december 31 2018 

see note 5 acquisitions divestitures and licensing transactions in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information 

other income expense 

other expense increased by 47 million or approximately 66 from expense of 71 million in 2018 to expense of 118 million in 2019 the increase in other expense is attributed to an increase in recognized actuarial loss of 98 million which was partially offset by 78 million of indemnification gain relating to the resolution of a foreign tax dispute and other ip related claims recognized in 2019 

income tax provision 

we recorded an income tax provision of 627 million and 1251 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2019 consisted primarily of 664 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations 60 million relating to the resolution of a foreign tax dispute and 33 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions and 21 million of prior year adjustments these amounts were offset by discrete benefits of 92 million relating to the release of reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions related to prior years and 59 million relating to equity award excess tax benefits 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2018 consisted primarily of 1800 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic current year operations and 352 million related to the finalization of the companys tax impacts of us tax reform these expenses were offset by a onetime benefit of 482 million related to us tax method changes made during the year that impacted the company’s global intangible low tax income “gilti” inclusion a benefit of 171 million relating to an increase in deferred tax assets expected to be realized in the foreseeable future due to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary a benefit of 140 million relating to the lapse of the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits a benefit of 76 million relating to equity award excess tax benefits and a benefit of 32 million relating to changes in valuation allowance 

in line with the oecd’s beps conclusions and changes to tax laws in the united states and certain countries in the european union we are considering simplifying our corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights to our intellectual property to the united states during the second half of 2020 the impact of such repatriation may have a material impact on our 2020 effective tax rate 

we expect our effective tax rate before discrete items or the impact mentioned above from the proposed repatriation of the economic rights to our intellectual property to be between 22 and 26 until we fully utilize all of our us federal net operating losses the primary difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 is due to foreign taxes for which the company will not receive a us tax credit as a result of us tax reform until our us federal net operating losses are fully utilized once our us federal net operating losses are fully utilized we expect our future effective tax rate before discrete items to approximate or be lower than the federal statutory rate of 21 we anticipate our us federal net operating losses and credits will be substantially utilized by 2021 

our cash tax as a percentage of income before income taxes “cash tax rate” has historically been significantly lower than our effective tax rate due to the current utilization of our us federal net operating losses and credits during 2019 our cash tax rate approximated our effective tax rate primarily due to the litigation settlement with pi we expect our future cash tax rate to be lower than our effective tax rate until our us federal net operating losses and credits are fully utilized 

we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our us state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses and tax credits in certain other foreign jurisdictions a substantial portion of which relate to japan net operating losses which are projected to expire prior to utilization

liquidity and capital resources 

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements offbalance sheet arrangements contingencies sources and uses of cash operations working capital and longterm assets and liabilities 

contractual obligations 

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt operating leases and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions   



 

1 the table above excludes approximately 281 million of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement of such liabilities 

2 includes interest payments at applicable rates as of december 31 2019 

3 these represent our offbalance sheet arrangements see “liquidity and capital resources—offbalance sheet arrangements” for a description of our offbalance sheet arrangements 

4 during 2019 we incurred additional commitments of 3300 million relating to the pending acquisition of a manufacturing facility which is included in the contractual obligations table see note 5 acquisitions divestitures and licensing transactions in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information 

the table also excludes our pension obligations we expect to make cash contributions to comply with local funding requirements and required benefit payments of approximately 173 million and 50 million respectively in 2020 this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2020 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations see note 12 employee benefit plans in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information on our pension obligations 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 8942 million as of december 31 2019 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash available from our revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months total cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2019 include approximately 3719 million available in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt service debt repayments and acquisitions while we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries we have the ability to obtain cash in the united states in order to cover our domestic needs through distributions from our foreign subsidiaries by utilizing existing credit facilities or through new bank loans or debt obligations

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties in connection with certain transactions including but not limited to material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases utilities or customs guarantees as of december 31 2019 our revolving credit facility included 150 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit there were 10 million letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019 which reduces our borrowing capacity dollarfordollar as of december 31 2019 we also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in the amount of 117 million 

as part of securing financing in the ordinary course of business we issued guarantees related to certain of our subsidiaries finance lease obligations equipment financing lines of credit and real estate mortgages which totaled 18 million as of december 31 2019 based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements for the foreseeable future 

we have not recorded any liability in connection with these letters of credit and guarantee arrangements see note 9 longterm debt and note 13 commitments and contingencies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

contingencies 

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to ip infringement environmental contamination and other property damage personal injury our failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or our breach of representations warranties or covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in economic damage bodily injury or property damage in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims 

we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities including certain liabilities under the exchange act that might be incurred by any director or officer in his or her capacity as such 

the fairchild acquisition agreement provides for indemnification and insurance rights in favor of fairchild’s then current and former directors officers and employees specifically we have agreed that for no fewer than six years following the fairchild acquisition we will a indemnify and hold harmless each such indemnitee against losses and expenses including advancement of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any proceeding asserted against the indemnified party in connection with such person’s servings as a director officer employee or other fiduciary of fairchild or its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the acquisition b maintain in effect all provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries or any other agreements of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries with any indemnified party regarding elimination of liability indemnification of officers directors and employees and advancement of expenses in existence on the date of the fairchild agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition and c subject to certain qualifications provide to fairchild’s then current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition that is no less favorable than fairchild’s thenexisting policy or if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable the best available coverage 

similarly the quantenna agreement provides for indemnification and insurance rights in favor of quantenna’s then current and former directors officers employees and agents specifically the company has agreed that for no fewer than six years following the quantenna acquisition the company will a indemnify and hold harmless each such indemnified party to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law in the event of any threatened or actual claim suit action proceeding or investigation against the indemnified party based in whole or in part on or pertaining to such person’s serving as a director officer employee or agent of quantenna or its subsidiaries or predecessors prior to the effective time of the acquisition or in connection with the quantenna agreement b maintain in effect provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of quantenna and each of its subsidiaries regarding the elimination of liability of directors and indemnification of officers directors and 

employees that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of quantenna and each of its subsidiaries in existence on the date of the quantenna agreement and c obtain and fully pay the premium for a noncancelable extension of directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of quantenna’s directors’ and officers’ policies and quantenna’s fiduciary liability insurance policies in effect as of the date of the quantenna agreement 

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

see legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for possible contingencies related to legal matters see also business—government regulation for information on certain environmental matters 

sources and uses of cash 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments for research and development to make capital expenditures to repurchase our common stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including principal and interest and finance lease payments we expect interest expense to remain significant in future periods as we continue to service our debt our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and with cash and cash equivalents on hand we also have the ability to utilize our revolving credit facility 

as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis during 2019 we completed the acquisition of quantenna see note 5 acquisitions divestitures and licensing transactions in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

• factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows including the impact on our business and operations as a result of changes in demand for our products competitive pricing pressures effective management of our manufacturing capacity our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business and 

• factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise including interest rate fluctuations macroeconomic conditions sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time 

our ability to service our longterm debt including our 1625 notes 100 notes revolving credit facility and term loan b facility to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next 12 months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

during the ordinary course of business we evaluate our cash requirements and if necessary adjust our expenditures for inventory operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and 

demand our capital expenditures are primarily directed toward production equipment and capacity expansion our capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives for example during 2019 we paid approximately 5346 million for capital expenditures while in 2018 we paid approximately 5148 million while our capital expenditures have historically been approximately 6 to 7 of annual revenue we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 10 and 9 of annual revenue in 2019 and 2018 respectively and expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately 8 of revenue in 2020 to further improve our manufacturing cost structure future capital expenditures are expected to be lower however may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted 

on march 31 2017 we completed the private unregistered offering of 5750 million aggregate principal amount of the 1625 notes which amount includes the full exercise of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase additional 1625 notes the net proceeds from the offering of the 1625 notes were used to repay 5621 million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan “b” facility 

on november 30 2017 we entered into the third amendment as defined below pursuant to which among other things we increased the amount that may be borrowed under the revolving credit facility to 10 billion in connection with the third amendment we prepaid 4000 million of borrowings under the term loan “b” facility 

on june 12 2019 the company entered into the fifth amendment as defined below to the amended credit agreement the fifth amendment provided for among other things modifications to the amended credit agreement to increase the amount that may be borrowed pursuant to the revolving credit facility by 9000 million to 19 billion the 9000 million was drawn to partially fund the acquisition of quantenna on june 19 2019 

on august 15 2019 the company entered into the sixth amendment as defined below to the amended credit agreement which increased amounts that may be borrowed under the revolving credit facility by 700 million to 197 billion 

on september 19 2019 the company entered into the seventh amendment as defined below to the amended credit agreement the seventh amendment provided for among other things modifications to the amended credit agreement to increase the amount that may be borrowed pursuant to the term loan “b” facility by approximately 5005 million up to an aggregate principal amount of 1635 billion we utilized the additional borrowings under the term loan b facility to repay 5000 million of outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility 

as of december 31 2019 there was 16309 million outstanding under the term loan “b” facility and 8000 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility the associated interest expense related to the term loan “b” facility and revolving credit facility has had and will continue to have a material impact on our results of operations throughout the term of the amended credit agreement 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we repurchased 78 million shares of common stock worth approximately 1389 million under the 2018 share repurchase program 

cash management 

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

primary cash flow sources 

our longterm cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash our cash flows from operating activities were 6947 million 12742 million and 10942 million for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

our cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased by 5795 million or 455 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in net income resulting in lower cash flows payment of variable compensation for prior year and litigation settlement payments our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on among other factors our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets 

our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below 

working capital 

working capital calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs in addition our working capital may be affected by acquisitions and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of longterm debt was 10434 million as of december 31 2019 and has fluctuated between 7674 million and 10434 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters our working capital including cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of longterm debt was 12016 million as of december 31 2019 and has fluctuated between 10220 million and 17974 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters 

although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives for the year ended december 31 2019 our working capital was most significantly impacted by our payments for variable compensation litigation settlement payments and capital expenditures see note 9 longterm debt and note 10 earnings per share and equity in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

longterm assets and liabilities 

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets deferred taxes and goodwill 

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt and deferred taxes consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans operating lease liabilities and contingent tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions for additional information see note 12 employee benefit plans note 8 balance sheet information and note 16 income taxes in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience current and expected future conditions thirdparty evaluations and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following i future payouts for customer incentives and amounts subject to allowances returns and warranties ii measurement of valuation allowances relating to inventories iii assumptions used in business combinations iv fair values of sharebased compensation and v measurement of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and evaluations of unrecognized tax benefits additionally during periods where it becomes applicable significant estimates will be used by management in determining the future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue to a much lesser extent from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled for sales agreements we have identified the promise to transfer products each of which is distinct to be the performance obligation for product development agreements we have identified the completion of a service defined in the agreement to be the performance obligation we apply a five step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized 1 identifying the contract with a customer 2 identifying the performance obligations in the contract 3 determining the transaction price 4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied we allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled substantially all of our revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer 

sales to certain distributors primarily those with ship and credit rights can be subject to price adjustment on certain products we develop an estimate of their expected claims under the ship and credit program based on the historical claims data submitted by product and customer and expected future claims which requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the amount of each claim as well as the historical period used to develop the estimate 

  

our oem customers do not have the right to return products other than pursuant to the provisions of the company’s standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances ship and credit claims and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue are recognized and are netted against revenue for returns we recognize a related asset for the right to recover returned products with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold we record a reserve for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and 

a reduction to revenue based on the experience with each customer although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days in addition the company offers cash discounts to certain customers for payments received within an agreed upon time generally 10 days after shipment 

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected enduser demand the determination of projected enduser demand requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected unit sales for each product these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory that is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved impacting our cost of revenue and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent over the period and the related impact on our margins has not been significant 

sharebased compensation we record compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including rsus and espps and measure them at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period determining the amount of sharebased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of the award we calculate the grantdate fair value of the award using valuation models which are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends for the past several years we have utilized rsus as our primary equity incentive compensation for employees we have outstanding awards with service performance and marketbased vesting provisions 

income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under this method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

in determining the amount of the valuation allowance estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies for each taxing jurisdiction are considered if we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 

  

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made which could have a material impact to our effective tax rate 

business combination we use significant estimates and assumptions in allocating the purchase price of acquired business by utilizing established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology industry to record the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value we utilize the income approach cost approach or market approach depending upon which approach is the most appropriate based on the nature and reliability of available data if the income approach is used the fair value determination is predicated upon the value of the future cash flows that an asset is expected to generate over its economic life and involves significant assumptions as to cash flows associated expenses longterm growth rates and discount rates the cost approach takes into account the cost to replace or reproduce the asset and involves assumptions relating to the assets value of physical functional andor economic obsolescence that has occurred with respect to the asset the market approach is used to estimate value from an analysis of actual transactions or offerings for economically comparable assets available as of the valuation date determining the fair value of acquired technology assets is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates 

and assumptions including the discount rate revenue growth rates projected gross margins and estimated research and development expenses 

impairment of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable our impairment evaluation consists of a qualitative assessment and if deemed necessary a quantitative test is performed which compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets associated with that unit goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value of the net assets associated with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is considered impaired and will be determined as the amount by which the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows discount and longterm growth rates we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows the assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenue gross profit operating expenses and industry trends we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and longterm growth rates to use in its analysis we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value 

we are required to test our iprd assets for impairment annually using the guidance for indefinitelived intangible assets an iprd asset is considered to be impaired when the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its fair value our impairment evaluation consists of first assessing qualitative factors and if deemed necessary we calculate the fair value of the iprd asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount exceeds fair value we determine the fair value based on an income approach which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the iprd asset the assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenue gross profit operating expenses and industry trends 

we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding iprd whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount impairment losses if applicable are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests 

contingencies  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

as of december 31 2019 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 37492 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 22651 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 14841 million balance of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2019 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately 74 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on 

deposits and investments also increase we entered into interest rate swaps to hedge some of the risk of variability in cash flows resulting from future interest payments on our variable interest rate debt 

to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures from an accounting and economic perspective however given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged we cannot provide any assurances that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the us dollar as a normal part of the reporting process some of our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a nonfunctional currency changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged the notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2019 and 2018 was 1833 million and 1573 million respectively our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies including japanese yen euros korean won malaysian ringgit philippine peso singapore dollars swiss francs chinese renminbi and czech koruna due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the us dollar for example we determined that based on a hypothetical weightedaverage change of 10 in currency exchange rates our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately 1057 million for the year ended december 31 2019 assuming no offsetting hedge position or correlated activities 

see note 15 financial instruments in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further information with respect to our hedging activity

endmarkets for our products 

the following table sets forth our principal endmarkets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenue generated from each endmarket during 2018 and sample applications for our products our industrial endmarket includes the data relating to the medical aerospace and defense and our communications endmarket includes the data relating to the networking and wireless 

 

 oems direct sales to oems accounted for approximately 34 of our revenue in 2018 34 of our revenue in 2017 and 38 of our revenue in 2016 oem customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry we focus on three types of oems multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core oem customers the target market customers for our endmarkets are oems that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our oem customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our warranty 

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 60 of our revenue in 2018 60 of our revenue in 2017 and 56 of our revenue in 2016 the 2017 increase being attributed to our acquisition of fairchild which had a greater distribution mix than our historical business our distributors resell to midsized and smaller oems and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns we developed our new internal processes and systems which enabled us to reliably estimate upfront the effects of returns and allowances and thus began recognizing revenue at the time of sales to the distributors beginning in the first quarter of 2017 prior to 2017 for products sold to distributors who are entitled to returns and allowances generally referred to as “ship and credit rights” we recognized related revenue and cost of revenue when we were informed by the distributors that they had resold the products to the enduser 

 

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 6 of our revenue in 2018 6 of our revenue in 2017 and 6 of our revenue in 2016 these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for oems originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many oems now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace generally our electronic manufacturing service customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our warranty

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

downturns or volatility in general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in recent years worldwide semiconductor industry sales have tracked the impact of the financial crisis subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty we believe that the state of economic conditions in the united states is particularly uncertain due to recent and expected shifts in legislative and regulatory conditions concerning among other matters international trade and taxation and that an uneven recovery or a renewed global downturn may put pressure on our sales due to reductions in customer demand as well as customers deferring purchases volatile andor uncertain economic conditions can adversely impact sales and profitability and make it difficult for us and our competitors to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected we may face oversupply of our products relative to customer demand in the past reduced customer spending has driven us and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which results in a negative effect on gross profit moreover volatility in revenue as a result of unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our shortterm and longterm strategies to the extent that our sales profitability and strategies are negatively affected by downturns or volatility in general economic conditions our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the loss of one of our largest customers or a significant reduction in the revenue we generate from these customers could materially adversely affect our revenue profitability and results of operations 

product sales to our ten largest endcustomers which excludes distributors have historically accounted for a significant amount of our business for instance for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 revenue from our 10 largest endcustomers collectively represented approximately 25 and 24 respectively of our total revenue for those years many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that our largest customers will not cease purchasing products from us in favor of products produced by other suppliers significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future and any such event could have a material adverse effect on our revenue profitability and results of operations 

 

because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the automotive industrial and communications industries a downturn or lower sales to customers in either industry could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

a significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive industrial including medical aerospace and defense and communications industries including wireless and networking sales into these industries represented approximately 31 27 and 18 of our revenue respectively for the year ended december 31 2018 and those percentages will vary from quarter to quarter each of the automotive industrial and communications industries is cyclical and as a result our customers in these industries are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions disruptive innovation and endmarket preferences which can adversely affect sales of our products and correspondingly our results of operations additionally the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in these industries could decline despite continued growth in their respective end markets lower sales to customers in the automotive industrial or communications industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and significant downturns or upturns in customer demand can materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and as a result is subject to significant downturns and upturns in customer demand for semiconductors and related products we cannot accurately predict the timing of future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry or how severe and prolonged these conditions might be significant downturns often occur in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used or declines in general economic conditions and can result in reduced product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results as a result of increased operating expenses outpacing decreased revenue reduced margins underutilization of our manufacturing capacity andor asset impairment charges on the other hand significant upturns can cause us to be unable to satisfy demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in the event of such an upturn we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

rapid innovation and short product life cycles in the semiconductor industry can result in price erosion of older products which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid innovation and short product life cycles which often results in price erosion especially with respect to products containing older technology products are frequently replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes and as demand for older technology falls the price at which such products can be sold drops in some cases precipitously in addition our and our competitors’ excess inventory levels can accelerate general price erosion 

in order to continue to profitably supply older products we must offset lower prices by reducing production costs typically through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies if we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our production efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of older products moreover we may not be able to cease production of older products either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products for a sustained period of time if reductions in our production costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

shortages or increased prices of raw materials could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including various chemicals and gases polysilicon silicon wafers aluminum gold silver copper lead frames mold compound and ceramic packages generally our agreements with suppliers of raw materials impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers of raw materials may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors beyond our control shortages could occur in various essential raw materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner the costs of our raw materials increases significantly their quality deteriorates or they give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

many of our facilities and processes are interdependent and an operational disruption at any particular facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce many of our products which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we utilize an integrated manufacturing platform in which multiple facilities may each produce one or more components necessary for the assembly of a single product as a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities an operational disruption at a facility toward the frontend of our manufacturing process may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products for example our facility in rožnov pod radhoštěm czech republic manufactures silicon wafers used by a number of our facilities and our intelligent sensing group relies predominantly on one thirdparty for manufacturing at the frontend of its manufacturing process and any operational disruption natural or manmade disaster or other extraordinary event that impacted either of those facilities would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce a number of our products worldwide in the event of a disruption at any such facility we may be unable to effectively source replacement components on acceptable terms from qualified third parties in which case our ability to produce many of our products could be materially disrupted or delayed conversely many of our facilities are single source facilities that only produce one of our endproducts and a disruption at any such facility would materially delay or cease production of the related product in the event of any such operational disruption we may experience difficulty in beginning production of replacement components or products at new facilities for example due to construction delays or transferring production to other existing facilities for example due to capacity constraints or difficulty in transitioning to new manufacturing processes any of which could result in a loss of future revenues and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if our technologies are subject to claims of infringement on the ip rights of third parties efforts to address such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may from time to time be subject to claims that we may be infringing thirdparty ip rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such ip rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a thirdparty for ip we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring such technologies further we may be subject to ip litigation which could cause us to incur significant expense materially adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

 

   

    there are several civil litigation proceedings with power integrations inc “pi” many of which were pending prior to the fairchild transaction and there are also over two dozen outstanding administrative proceedings between the parties at the united states patent and trademark office the “uspto” in which each party is challenging the validity of the other party’s patents please see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a more detailed description of the litigation and related administrative matters with pi and other legal matters we are currently engaged in 

the outcome of ip litigation is inherently uncertain and if not resolved in our favor could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts often in markets or regions in which we have less experience than others our decision to pursue an acquisition is based on among other factors our estimates of expected future earnings growth and potential cost savings for example we may anticipate rationalization of a combined infrastructure and savings through integration of a newly acquired business into our business and our estimates could turn out to be incorrect risks related to successful integration of an acquisition include but are not limited to 1 the ability to integrate information technology and other systems 2 unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence 3 customers responding by changing their existing business relationships with us or the acquired company 4 diversion of management’s attention from our day to day operations and 5 loss of key employees due to uncertainty about positions postintegration in addition we may incur unexpected costs such as operating or restructuring costs including severance payments to departing employees or taxes resulting from the acquisition or integration of the newly acquired business in the past we have recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions as a result of such factors as significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results missteps or delays in integrating our acquisitions which could be caused by factors outside of our control or our failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions on the timeline we anticipate or at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

depending on the level of our ownership interest in and the extent to which we can exercise control over the acquired business we may be required by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and sec rules and regulations to consolidate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements such statements may not be prepared in accordance with gaap or the acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems any of which could materially impair our ability to properly integrate such businesses into our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis any revisions to inaccuracies in or restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to accounting for our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may be unable to maintain manufacturing efficiency which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing requires advanced equipment and significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs which include depreciation expense manufacturing semiconductor components also involves highly complex processes that we and our competitors are continuously modifying to improve yields and product performance in addition impurities waste or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower production yields our manufacturing efficiency is and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or be successful in our manufacturing rationalization plans if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at expected levels or if production capacity increases while revenue does not the fixed costs and other operating expenses associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the failure to successfully implement cost reduction initiatives including through restructuring activities could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

from time to time we have implemented cost reduction initiatives in response to significant downturns in our industry including relocating manufacturing to lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to lower costs implementing personnel reductions and voluntary retirement programs reducing employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs have been primarily composed of employee separation costs including severance payments and asset impairments we also often undertake restructuring activities and programs to improve our cost structure in connection with our business acquisitions which can result in significant charges including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges 

we cannot assure you that our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the associated cost reductions could materially adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position to the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other benefits of our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives that we anticipate our results of operations may be materially adversely effected 

 

if we are unable to identify and make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process and often requires significant capital investment and lead time for development and testing we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive in addition the lengthy development cycle for our products limits our ability to adapt quickly to changes affecting the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers there can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” for new products in addition design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or that we will generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments as expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured there is no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop new products that a significant investment in new products will be profitable or that we will have margins as high as we anticipate at the time of investment or have experienced historically to the extent that we underinvest in our research and development efforts or that our investments and capital expenditures in research and development do not lead to sales of new products we may be unable to bring to market technologies and products that are attractive to our customers and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to develop new products to satisfy changing customer demands or regulatory requirements which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving regulatory and industry standards and certifications changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions our success is largely dependent on our ability to accurately predict identify and adapt to changes affecting the requirements of our customers in a timely and costeffective manner additionally the emergence of new industry or regulatory standards and certification requirements may adversely affect the demand for our products we focus our independent new product development efforts on market segments and applications that we anticipate will experience growth but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying highgrowth areas or develop products that meet industry standards or certification requirements in a timely manner a fundamental shift in technologies the regulatory climate or consumption patterns and preferences in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could make our current products obsolete prevent or delay the introduction of new products that we planned to make or render our current or new products irrelevant to our customers’ needs if our new product development efforts fail to align with the needs of our customers including due to circumstances outside of our control like a fundamental shift in the product markets of our customers and end users or regulatory changes our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

uncertainties regarding the timing and amount of customer orders could lead to excess inventory and writedowns of inventory that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers requiring a commitment to purchase our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and generally prior to start of production for custom products without incurring a penalty we routinely generate inventory based on customers’ estimates of enduser demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties which may vary significantly in times of under supply for certain products some customers could respond by inflating their demand signals as markets level off and supply capacity begins to match actual market demands we could experience an increased risk of inventory writedowns which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction of products due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers unsold inventory canceled orders and cancellation penalties may materially adversely affect our results of operations and inventory writedowns which may materially adversely affect our financial condition 

if we do not have access to capital on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we require a substantial amount of capital to meet our operating requirements and remain competitive we routinely incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency to upgrade equipment and to expand production capacity and there can be no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended we have incurred and may continue to incur material amounts of debt to fund these requirements significant volatility or disruption in the global financial markets may result in us not being able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all and we may not be able to refinance if necessary any outstanding debt when due all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition any inability to obtain additional funding on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all may cause us to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or obtain funds through arrangements that management does not currently anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies the occurrence of any of which may significantly impair our ability to remain competitive if our operating results falter our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fully customized ics as well as from customers who develop their own ic products in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

 

our inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations products or technologies developed by competitors that are larger and have more substantial research and development budgets or that are smaller and more targeted in their development efforts may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive we also may be unable to market and sell our products if they are not competitive on the basis of price quality technical performance features system compatibility customized design innovation availability delivery timing and reliability if we fail to compete effectively on developing strategic relationships with customers and customer sales and technical support our sales and revenue may be materially adversely affected competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise prices and any inability to maintain revenue or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a significant adverse effect on our gross margin reduced sales and lower gross margins would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry has experienced rapid consolidation and our inability to compete with large competitors or failure to identify attractive opportunities to consolidate may materially adversely affect our business 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by the high costs associated with developing marketable products and manufacturing technologies as well as high levels of investment in production capabilities as a result the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including but not limited to substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition in addition we may be at a competitive disadvantage to our peers if we fail to identify attractive opportunities to acquire companies to expand our business consolidation among our competitors and integration among our customers could erode our market share negatively impact our capacity to compete and require us to restructure our operations any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

natural disasters and other business disruptions could cause significant harm to our business operations and facilities and could adversely affect our supply chain and our customer base any of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition 

our us and international manufacturing facilities and distribution centers as well as the operations of our thirdparty suppliers are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods hurricanes earthquakes typhoons and similar natural disasters as well as power outages telecommunications failures industrial accidents and similar events the occurrence of natural disasters in any of the regions in which we operate could severely disrupt the operations of our businesses by negatively impacting our supply chain our ability to deliver products and the cost of our products such events can negatively impact revenue and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event in addition these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the us and worldwide economies although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms to the extent any losses from natural disasters or other business disruptions are not covered by insurance any costs writedowns impairments and decreased revenue can materially adversely affect our business our results of operations and our financial condition 

 

we are dependent on the services of thirdparty suppliers and contract manufacturers and any disruption in or deterioration of the quality of the services delivered by such third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use thirdparty contractors for certain of our manufacturing activities primarily wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to commit to purchase services based on forecasted product needs which may be inaccurate and in some cases require longerterm commitments we are also dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized thirdparty suppliers for required components and materials for certain of our key technologies arranging for replacement manufacturers and suppliers can be time consuming and costly and the number of qualified alternative providers can be extremely limited our business operations productivity and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasted needs proved to be materially incorrect 

our global operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on a global level that could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the asiapacific region and europe and we maintain significant operations in these regions in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region risks inherent in doing business on a global level include among others the following 

 

              we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets the materialization of any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates or the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or have exposure to additional tax liabilities which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

changes to income tax laws or regulations in the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws or regulations could under our existing tax structure significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities result in us having to restructure and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition other factors or events including business combinations and investment transactions changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns or as a result of deficiencies asserted by taxing authorities increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in available tax credits increasing operations in high tax jurisdictions and changes in tax rates could also increase our future effective tax rate 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service the “irs” and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these changes if adopted by countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

the impact of recent us tax legislation is uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation hr1 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code many of the changes require additional guidance including through the issuance of final treasury regulations which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the tax act although our accounting under asc 740 for the provisions of the tax act is now complete our analysis and interpretation of the tax act and proposed treasury regulations are ongoing and may include judgments and interpretations that could change based on final treasury regulations or other guidance or due to actions that the company may take in response to such regulatory change as a result the impact of the tax act may differ from our estimates possibly materially 

the tax act could have a material benefit or material adverse impact and could result in volatility in our effective tax rate tax expense and cash flow any benefit associated with the lower us corporate tax rate could be reduced or outweighed by the cost of compliance or other adverse regulatory changes related to the tax act or final treasury regulations 

 

we operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies andor legal entity structures which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are therefore subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties there is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results or operations and cash flows 

our legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations changes in tax laws regulations future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in us becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

currency fluctuations changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sizeable sales and operations in the asiapacific region and europe and a significant amount of this business is transacted in currency other than us dollars in addition while a significant percentage of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside the us many of our liabilities including our outstanding indebtedness and certain other cash payments such as share repurchases are payable in us dollars as a result currency fluctuations and changes in foreign exchange regulations can have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

in addition repatriation of funds held outside the us could have adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay due to required local country approvals or local obligations from time to time we are required to make cash deposits outside of the us to support bank guarantees of our obligations under certain office leases or amounts we owe to certain vendors and such cash deposits are not available for other uses as long as the related bank guarantees are outstanding foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency as a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the us our financial flexibility may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations restrictions on repatriation or the inability to use cash held abroad to fund our operations in the us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

 

changes in tariffs or other government trade policies may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations including by reducing demand for our products 

the imposition of tariffs and trade restrictions as a result of international trade disputes or changes in trade policies may adversely affect our sales and profitability for example in 2018 the us government imposed and proposed among other actions new or higher tariffs on specified imported products originating from china in response to what it characterizes as unfair trade practices and china has responded by imposing and proposing new or higher tariffs on specified products including some semiconductors fabricated in the united states there can be no assurance that a broader trade agreement will be successfully negotiated between the united states and china to reduce or eliminate these tariffs these tariffs and the related geopolitical uncertainty between the united states and china may cause decreased endmarket demand for our products from distributors and other customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for example certain of our foreign customers may respond to the imposition of tariffs or threat of tariffs on products we produce by delaying purchase orders purchasing products from our competitors or developing their own products ongoing international trade disputes and changes in trade policies could also impact economic activity and lead to a general contraction of customer demand in addition tariffs on components that we import from china or other nations that have imposed or may in the future impose tariffs will adversely affect our profitability unless we are able to exclude such components from the tariffs or we raise prices for our products which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors future actions or escalations by either the united states or china that affect trade relations may also impact our business or that of our suppliers or customers and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether such actions will occur or the form that they may take to the extent that our sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

changes in government trade policies could limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

the us congress or us regulatory authorities may take administrative legislative or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to make sales to certain of our customers particularly in china we could experience unanticipated restrictions on our ability to sell to certain foreign customers where sales of products and the provision of services may require export licenses or are prohibited by government action for example the us department of commerce could ban the export of us products to foreign customers the terms and duration of any such restrictions may not be known to us in advance and may be subject to ongoing modifications even to the extent such restrictions are subsequently lifted any financial or other penalties imposed on affected foreign customers could have a negative impact on future orders such foreign customers may also respond to sanctions or the threat of sanctions by developing their own solutions or adopting alternative solutions or competitors’ solutions the loss or temporary loss of customers as a result of such future regulatory limitations could materially adversely affect our sales business and results of operations 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 

our success depends on our ability to attract motivate and retain highly skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel both in the us and internationally in the semiconductor industry the competition for qualified personnel particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees is intense particularly when the business cycle is improving during such periods competitors may try to recruit our most valuable technical employees while we devote a great deal of our attention to designing competitive compensation programs aimed at attracting and retaining personnel specific elements of our compensation programs may not be competitive with those of our competitors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and on our business 

if we must reduce our use of equity awards to compensate our employees our competitiveness in the employee marketplace could be adversely affected and our results of operations could vary as a result of changes in our stockbased compensation programs 

we have issued in the past and expect to continue to issue rsus with timebased vesting performancebased awards and common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time as compensation tools while this is a routine practice in many parts of the world foreign exchange and income tax regulations in some countries make this practice more and more difficult such regulations tend to diminish the value of equity compensation to our employees in those countries our current practice is to seek stockholder approval of new or amendments to existing equity compensation plans if these proposals do not receive stockholder approval we may not be able to grant equity awards to employees at the same levels as in the past which could materially adversely affect our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel thereby materially adversely affecting our business in addition changes in forecasted stockbased compensation expense could cause our results of operations to vary by impacting our gross margin percentage research and development expenses marketing general and administrative expenses and our tax rate 

disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could materially harm our business and reputation 

currently certain of our us employees in pennsylvania are represented by labor unions in addition we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to production slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in a loss of business and material damage to our reputation in addition union activity and compliance with international labor standards could result in higher labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the enforceability of our patents trademarks copyrights software licenses and other ip is uncertain in certain circumstances effective ip protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the us and internationally the various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered ip assets patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts with respect to our ip generally we cannot assure you that 

 

    when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights of its own against us which may materially adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications we seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to ip arising out of our research should we be unable to protect our ip competitors may develop products or technologies that duplicate our products or technologies benefit financially from innovations for which we bore the costs of development and undercut the sales and marketing of our products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

environmental and health and safety liabilities and expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground and we have been identified as either a primary responsible party or a potentially responsible party at sites where we or our predecessors operated or disposed of waste in the past our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other requirements regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances we have indemnities from third parties for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities for periods prior to our operations at some of our current and past sites and we have also purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance will cover any or all of our material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities including 

 

     to the extent that we face unforeseen environmental or health and safety compliance costs or remediation expenses or liabilities that are not covered by indemnities or insurance we may bear the full effect of such costs expense and liabilities which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards 

like most publicly traded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm as we continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future 

 

there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future failure to comply with sox including delaying or failing to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such transactions and the trading price of our common stock or other securities may decline in addition if we fail to remedy any material weakness our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements our financial statements may be materially inaccurate our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process requiring production in a tightly controlled clean environment minute impurities in our manufacturing materials contaminants in the manufacturing environment manufacturing equipment failures and other defects can cause our products to be noncompliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in electrical design oems are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage if any and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall could have material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them and claims for consequential damages against our customers from their customers we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenue and profits we receive from the products involved in certain instances we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective and to the extent that we are liable for damages in excess of the revenue and profits we received from the products involved our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could irreparably damage our reputation and our business expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we routinely collect and store sensitive data including ip and other proprietary information about our business and our customers suppliers and business partners the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses illegal hacking criminal fraud or impersonation acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error our security measures andor those of our thirdparty service providers andor customers may not detect or prevent such security breaches the costs to us to reduce the risk of or alleviate cyber security breaches and vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may materially impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions any such compromise of our information security could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business an interruption in our operations the unauthorized transfer of cash or other of our assets the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws in addition computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities and any such attack if successful could expose us to liability to customer claims any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

sales through distributors and other third parties expose us to risks that if realized could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face risks related to our sale of a significant and increasing portion of our products through distributors distributors may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the fcpa or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our contracts could result in among other things damages fines or other liabilities 

we have a diverse customer base consisting of both private sector clients and public sector clients including the us government sales to our private sector clients are generally based on stated contractual terms the terms and conditions on our website or terms contained in purchase orders on a transactionbytransaction basis sales to our public sector clients are generally derived from sales to federal state and local governmental departments and agencies through various contracts and programs which may require compliance with regulations covering many areas of our operations including but not limited to accounting practices ip rights information handling and security noncompliance with contract terms particularly with respect to highlyregulated public sector clients or with government procurement regulations could result in fines or penalties against us termination of such contracts or civil criminal and administrative liability to the company with respect to public sector clients the government’s remedies may also include suspension or debarment from future government business in addition almost all of our contracts have default provisions and certain of our contracts in the public sector are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency the effect of any of these possible actions or the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations or practices could materially adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

 

the company is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future the company collects personally identifiable information “pii” and other data as part of its business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union and other relevant jurisdictions where the company conducts business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are currently more restrictive than those in the us additionally in may 2016 the european union adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” that imposed more stringent data protection requirements and provided for greater penalties for noncompliance beginning in may 2018 although the company has substantially complied with the gdpr any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or to comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to the company or company officials damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial debt could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2018 we had 29390 million of outstanding indebtedness we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future to repay or refinance other outstanding debt to make acquisitions or for other purposes and if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

 

          

  to the extent that we continue to maintain or expand our significant indebtedness our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

indebtedness incurred in connection with the fairchild transaction could materially and adversely affect us by among other things limiting our ability to conduct our operations and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

in connection with our acquisition of fairchild we entered into the amended credit agreement which as subsequently amended provides for our 10 billion revolving credit facility which provides liquidity to us and our 24 billion term loan “b” facility the proceeds of which were initially used to fund the acquisition of fairchild the obligations under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the personal property and material real property assets of the company and most of the company’s domestic subsidiaries as a result if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the amended credit agreement the lenders could take possession of and foreclose on the pledged collateral securing the indebtedness in which case we would be at risk of losing the related collateral which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations in addition subject to customary exceptions the amended credit agreement requires mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances which may result in prepaying outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility and the term loan “b” facility rather than using funds for other business purposes our acquisitionrelated financing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition including among other things our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and could reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

the agreements relating to our indebtedness including the amended credit agreement may restrict our ability to operate our business and as a result may materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our debt agreements including the amended credit agreement contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to 

 

            

such agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them to the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations our financial condition may be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us to the extent that we are unable to engage in activities that support the growth profitability and competitiveness of our business our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations and any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations as they come due we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect furthermore we cannot assure you that if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness which could materially negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition a default under our committed credit facilities including our amended credit agreement could also limit our ability to make further borrowings under those facilities which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to the current stockholders 

an event of default under any agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness could cross default other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if there were an event of default under certain of our agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness any such cross default would put immediate pressure on our liquidity and financial condition and would amplify the risks described above with regards to being unable to repay our indebtedness when due and payable we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if our operating subsidiaries which may have no independent obligation to repay our debt are not able to make cash available to us for such repayment our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if interest rates increase our debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could increase significantly which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

borrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time including under our amended credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and as a result expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease during the first quarter of 2017 we entered into interest rate swaps that involved the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility for a portion of our term loan “b” facility through the end of 2019 however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk to the extent the risk materializes and is not fully mitigated the resulting increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

servicing the 100 notes and 1625 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 100 notes and 1625 notes in a timely manner 

in june 2015 we issued 6900 million aggregate principal amount of our 100 notes and in march 2017 we issued 5750 million aggregate principal amount of our 1625 notes holders of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined under the respective indentures governing such notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change repurchase date in addition upon conversion of the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes to be repurchased unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares we will be required to make cash payments in respect of such 100 notes andor 1625 notes being converted moreover we will be required to repay the 100 notes and the 1625 notes in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted or repurchased servicing the 100 notes and the1625 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 100 notes and the 1625 notes our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes repurchase the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes in the event of a fundamental change or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would dilute existing stockholders in addition if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of such notes which could cross default other debt and materially adversely harm our business the terms of the amended credit agreement limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur but the terms of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above our decision to use our cash for other purposes such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock could also intensify these risks 

the conditional conversion feature of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and if we elect to settle the conversion of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes in common stock any such settlement could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

if specified conditions are met holders of the 100 notes may convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding september 1 2020 and holders of the 1625 notes may convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding july 15 2023 unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligations by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares in the event the conditional conversion feature under either the 100 notes or the 1625 notes is triggered holders electing to convert their notes could require us to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligations through the payment of cash which could materially adversely affect our liquidity alternatively if the conditional conversion feature under either the 100 notes or the 1625 notes is triggered and holders do not elect to convert their notes we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of such notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital any material decrease in our liquidity or reduction in our net working capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may elect to settle a conversion of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes solely in common stock to avoid an event of default under our amended credit agreement and any such issuance of common stock could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders including stockholders who previously converted such notes to shares of our common stock 

 

the fundamental change repurchase feature of our 100 notes and 1625 notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company 

the terms of our 100 notes and 1625 notes require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined under the respective indentures governing such notes in certain circumstances a takeover of our company could trigger an option of the holders of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes to require us to repurchase such notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors in the 100 notes and the 1625 notes and our common stock which could materially decrease the value of such notes and of our common stock 

note hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

concurrently with the issuance of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions which we refer to as the option counterparties the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the respective series of notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes of such series as the case may be we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds 2596 with respect to the 100 notes and 3070 with respect to the 1625 notes 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock andor entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock following the pricing of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes respectively the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes respectively and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 100 notes or 1625 notes following any repurchase of the 100 notes or 1625 notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions if realized could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we are subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral if one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions 

 

to the extent the option counterparties do not honor their contractual commitments with us pursuant to the note hedge transactions we could face a material increase in our exposure to potential dilution upon any conversion of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes andor cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 100 notes or 1625 notes as the case may be our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock in addition upon a default by one of the option counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences with respect to our common stock any such adverse tax consequences or increased cash payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability and unexpected changes may impact the value of our common stock a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenue could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter in addition to the other factors described above factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

 

              an adverse change or development in any of the above factors could cause the market price of common stock to materially decline 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors 

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors among others some of which are beyond our control 

 

       the trading price of our common stock in the past has had significant volatility and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a thirdparty to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

 

   although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders any delay or prevention of an acquisition of our company that would have been beneficial to our stockholders could materially decrease the value of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto which are included elsewhere in this form 10k management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains statements that are forwardlooking these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk uncertainties and other factors actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed in “risk factors” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

executive overview 

this executive overview presents summarized information regarding our industry markets business and operating trends only for further information relating to the information summarized herein see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in its entirety 

 

industry overview 

according to wsts an industry research firm worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 4688 billion in 2018 an increase of approximately 137 from 4122 billion in 2017 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenue and revenue in our serviceable addressable market “sam” since 2014 

 

  

  

 as indicated above worldwide semiconductor sales increased from 3358 billion in 2014 to 4688 billion in 2018 the increase of 137 from 2017 to 2018 was the result of increased demand for semiconductor products sales in our sam increased from 639 billion in 2014 to 820 billion in 2018 the increase of 102 from 2017 to 2018 is consistent with the trend in the worldwide semiconductor market

we believe that some of the key factors and trends affecting our results of operations include but not limited to 

 

        recent on semiconductor results 

our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 was 58783 million an increase of approximately 60 from 55431 million from the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue in our power solutions group and analog solutions group as a result of better demand during 2018 we reported net income attributable to on semiconductor of 6274 million compared to 8107 million in 2017 net income attributable to on semiconductor for the year ended december 31 2017 was positively impacted by 4499 million relating to the us tax reform as well as the change in revenue recognition from sellthrough to sellin for shipment to our distributors excluding the impact of these items the improved results for 2018 were attributable to healthy enduser demand for our products and contributions from the acquired fairchild business our gross margin increased by approximately 140 basis points to 381 in 2018 from 367 in 2017 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to more favorable product mix 

business and macroeconomic environment influence on cost savings and restructuring activities 

we have historically pursued and expect to continue to pursue costsaving initiatives to align our overall cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our expected revenue spending and capacity levels based on our current sales and manufacturing projections we have recognized efficiencies from previously implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions we have historically taken significant actions to align our overall cost structure with our expectations of market conditions and by focusing on synergiesrelated cost reductions arising from each of our acquisitions however there can be no assurances that we will adequately forecast economic conditions or that we will effectively align our cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our revenue spending and capacity levels in the future 

see “results of operations—restructuring asset impairments and other net” below along with note 7 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information relating to our most recent costsaving initiatives 

results of operations 

our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 include the full year results and our results of operations for the year ended december 2016 include the partial year results from our acquisition of fairchild on september 19 2016 our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2018 include the partial year results from our acquisition of sensl on may 8 2018 

 

operating results 

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements in millions 

 

 revenue 

revenue was 58783 million 55431 million and 39069 million for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

 

prior to the first quarter of 2017 we recognized revenue from distributors under the sellthrough method as we did not have the ability to estimate the effects of returns and allowances beginning in the first quarter of 2017 we were able to estimate upfront the effects of returns and allowances and record revenue at the time of shipments to our distributors this change resulted in us recognizing an additional 1551 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2017 which resulted in an increase of 590 million to gross profit and income before income taxes for such period the impact of this change is reflected in the discussion below 

the increase of 3352 million or approximately 6 in revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to approximately 8 and 6 increases in revenue in our power solutions group and analog solutions group respectively as a result of better demand for these products excluding the onetime impact of the change in revenue recognition for the year ended december 31 2017 amounting to 1551 million revenue increased 4903 million or approximately 9 

the increase in revenue from 2017 compared to 2016 of 16362 million or approximately 42 was primarily attributable to approximately 65 and 32 increases in revenue in our power solutions group and analog solutions group respectively as a result of increased demand for these products the year 2017 included an entire twelvemonth period of fairchild revenue and 1551 million in revenue due to the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales excluding the onetime impact of the change in revenue recognition for the year ended december 31 2017 revenue increased 14811 million or approximately 38 

revenue by reportable segment for each were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

1 certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts 

revenue from the power solutions group 

revenue from the power solutions group increased by 2189 million or approximately 8 during 2018 compared to 2017 and increased by 11107 million or approximately 65 during 2017 compared to 2016 excluding the 1078 million increase in revenue due to the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales during the year ended december 31 2017 revenue increased by 3267 million or 12 in 2018 compared to 2017 

the 2018 increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue of 1659 million in our power mosfet division due to increased demand an increase in revenue of our high power division by 838 million due to entry into new markets and to a lesser extent 300 million increase in our integrated circuits division and 285 million increase in our protection and signal division also due to better demand 

the 2017 increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of fairchild which had a full year contribution in 2017 as well as a 1078 million impact due to the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales during the first quarter of 2017 these two factors contributed to increases in substantially all of the divisions within this segment which resulted in a 4178 million increase in revenue in our power mosfet division a 3278 million increase in revenue in our high power division and to a lesser extent 1329 million increase in revenue in our integrated circuits division and 1207 million increase in revenue in our protection and signal division 

 

revenue from the analog solutions group 

revenue from the analog solutions group increased by 1203 million or approximately 6 during 2018 compared to 2017 and increased by 4694 million or approximately 32 during 2017 compared to 2016 excluding the 421 million increase in revenue due to the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales during the year ended december 31 2017 revenue increased by 1624 million or 9 in 2018 compared to 2017 

the 2018 increase was primarily attributable to revenue in our mobile and computing division increasing by 785 million revenue in our signal wireless and medical division increasing by 305 million and revenue in our automotive division increasing by 528 million all due to increase in demand in the markets served 

the 2017 increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of fairchild which had a full year contribution in 2017 as well as a 421 million impact due to the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales during the first quarter of 2017 these two factors contributed to increases in substantially all of the divisions within this segment which resulted in a 1506 million increase in revenue in our mobile solutions division a 1003 million increase in revenue in our automotive division a 975 million increase in revenue in our then digital and dcdc division and a 813 million increase in revenue in our industrial and offline power division 

revenue from the intelligent sensing group 

revenue from the intelligent sensing group decreased by 40 million or approximately 1 during 2018 compared to 2017 and increased by 561 million or approximately 8 during 2017 compared to 2016 

the 2018 decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in our consumer solutions division revenue by 526 million primarily as a result of the exit of the mobile cis business and a 78 million decrease in our industrial solutions division due to our deemphasis of certain lower margin product lines as well as decreased demand offset by an increase in our automotive solutions division revenue by 566 million due to better demand in the markets served 

the 2017 increase was primarily attributable to an 849 million or 29 increase in revenue in our automotive solutions division which was partially offset by a 396 million or approximately 13 decrease in revenue in our consumer solutions division as a result of the exit of the mobile cis business which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 for further information on the mobile cis business exit see note 5 “acquisitions divestitures and licensing transactions”

3 unallocated manufacturing costs are being shown as a percentage of total revenue includes expensing of the fair market value stepup of inventory of 675 million during 2016 136 million during 2017 and 10 million during 2018 

our gross profit was 22387 million 20356 million and 13005 million for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the gross profit increase of 2031 million or approximately 10 for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in gross profit in our power solutions group and analog solutions group gross profit for the year ended december 31 2017 was positively impacted by 590 million due to the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales and negatively impacted by 136 million of expensing fair market value of inventory stepup from the fairchild acquisition excluding these items gross profit increased by 2485 million or 12 for the year ended december 31 2018 

the gross profit increase of 7351 million or approximately 57 for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in gross profit in our power solutions group and analog solutions group which included a fullyear of contributions from the acquired fairchild business and the positive impact due to the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales gross profit improvement in the intelligent sensing group of 649 million was due to increased revenue in high margin automotive and industrial markets offsetting decreased revenue on the exit of the mobile cis business 

gross margin increased to approximately 381 during 2018 compared to approximately 367 during 2017 the increase was due to a combination of operational leverage as a result of better demand entry into new markets and product mix and was offset by slightly lower factory utilization 

gross margin increased to approximately 367 during 2017 compared to approximately 333 during 2016 excluding the expensing of the fair market value of inventory stepup from the fairchild acquisition gross margin increased to approximately 369 during 2017 compared to approximately 350 during 2016 the increase was primarily due to higher factory utilization product mix which included the mix shift in imaging products to higher margin automotive and industrial imaging products and the exit of the lower margin mobile cis business

licensing income was 366 million 476 million and zero for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the information below summarizes the major activities in each year 

licensing income was 366 million for 2018 primarily due to the achievement of the established criteria based on which income was recognized under the various licensing agreements we have completed recognizing licensing income under existing agreements as of december 31 2018 

licensing income was 476 million for 2017 compared to zero for 2016 approximately 451 million was attributable to payments received under an asset purchase agreement with hset electronic tech hong kong limited in connection with our licensing of certain patents related to the mobile cis business the remaining 25 million was received from various other licensing agreements 

see note 5 “acquisitions divestitures and licensing transactions” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information

other expense decreased by 17 million from expense of 88 million in 2017 to 71 million in 2018 other expense decreased by 25 million from expense of 113 million in 2016 to 88 million in 2017 the change from year to year is attributable to fluctuations in foreign currencies against the us dollar for the periods presented net of the impact from our hedging activity pension related gain and losses and an adjustment to contingent consideration 

income tax provision benefit 

we recorded an income tax provision of 1251 million an income tax benefit of 2655 million and an income tax benefit of 39 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2018 consisted primarily of 1800 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic current year operations and 352 million related to the finalization of the company’s tax impacts of us tax reform these expenses were offset by a onetime benefit of 482 million related to us tax method changes made during the year that impacted the company’s global intangible low tax income “gilti” inclusion a benefit of 171 million relating to an increase in deferred tax assets expected to be realized in the foreseeable future due to the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary a benefit of 140 million relating to the lapse of the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits a benefit of 76 million relating to equity award excess tax benefits and a benefit of 32 million relating to changes in valuation allowance 

the income tax benefit for 2017 consisted primarily of the provisional benefit of 4499 million related to the estimated impact of us tax reform and related effects and a discrete benefit of 132 million relating to equity award excess tax benefits these benefits were offset by 1868 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic current year operations and 108 million relating to the establishment of an additional valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets 

 

the income tax benefit for 2016 consisted primarily of the reversal of 3598 million of our previously established valuation allowance against part of our us federal and foreign deferred tax assets and the release of 19 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2016 this was partially offset by 3108 million related to the reversal of the prior years’ indefinite reinvestment assertion 435 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations and 35 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions 

our effective tax rate for 2018 was 166 which differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate of 21 primarily due to us tax method changes made during the year that impacted the company’s gilti inclusion our effective tax rate for 2017 was a benefit of 485 which differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 primarily due to us tax reform codified under the tax act our effective tax rate for 2016 was a benefit of 22 which differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the release of our us and japan valuation allowances partially offset by the reversal of the prior years’ indefinite reinvestment assertion 

we expect our effective tax rate before discrete items to be between 23 and 27 until we fully utilize all of our us federal net operating losses the primary difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 21 is due to foreign taxes for which the company will not receive a us tax credit as a result of us tax reform until our us federal net operating losses are fully utilized once our us federal net operating losses are fully utilized we expect our future effective tax rate before discrete items to approximate or be lower than the federal statutory rate of 21 we anticipate our us federal net operating losses and credits will be fully utilized by 2021 

our cash tax as a percentage of income before income taxes “cash tax rate” is significantly lower than our effective tax rate due to the current utilization of our us federal net operating losses and credits we expect our future cash tax rate to approximate our effective tax rate once our us federal net operating losses and credits are fully utilized 

we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our us state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses and tax credits in certain other foreign jurisdictions a substantial portion of which relate to japan net operating losses which are projected to expire prior to utilization

liquidity and capital resources 

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements offbalance sheet arrangements contingencies sources and uses of cash operations working capital and longterm assets and liabilities 

 

contractual obligations 

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt capital leases operating leases and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2018 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

 

  

   the table also excludes our pension obligations we expect to make cash contributions to comply with local funding requirements and required benefit payments of approximately 153 million and 47 million respectively in 2019 this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2019 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations see note 12 “employee benefit plans” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information on our pension obligations 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 10696 million as of december 31 2018 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months total cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018 include approximately 4487 million available in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt service debt repayments and acquisitions while we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries we have the ability to obtain cash in the united states in order to cover our domestic needs through distributions from our foreign subsidiaries by utilizing existing credit facilities or through new bank loans or debt obligations 

see note 9 “longterm debt” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a discussion of our longterm debt see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” included elsewhere in this form 10k for a discussion of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and our stock repurchase activities 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into various operating leases for buildings equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

in the ordinary course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties in connection with certain transactions including but not limited to material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases utilities or customs guarantees as of december 31 2018 our revolving credit facility included 150 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit there were 10 million letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2018 which reduces our borrowing capacity dollarfordollar as of december 31 2018 we also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in the amount of 61 million at december 31 2018 

as part of securing financing in the ordinary course of business we issued guarantees related to certain of our subsidiaries’ capital lease obligations equipment financing lines of credit and real estate mortgages which totaled 686 million as of december 31 2018 based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements for the foreseeable future 

for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and similarly incur expenses totaling 1608 million as payments come due we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases letters of credit and guarantee arrangements we will record the associated lease obligations as a liability when we adopt the provisions of the new leasing standard as defined below see note 4 “recent accounting pronouncements” “note 9” “longterm debt” and note 13 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

contingencies 

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to ip infringement environmental contamination and other property damage personal injury our failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or our breach of representations warranties or covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in economic damage bodily injury or property damage in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims 

we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities including certain liabilities under the exchange act that might be incurred by any director or officer in his or her capacity as such 

 

the fairchild agreement provides for indemnification and insurance rights in favor of fairchild’s then current and former directors officers and employees specifically the company has agreed that for no fewer than six years following the fairchild acquisition the company will a indemnify and hold harmless each such indemnitee against losses and expenses including advancement of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any proceeding asserted against the indemnified party in connection with such person’s servings as a director officer employee or other fiduciary of fairchild or its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the acquisition b maintain in effect all provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries or any other agreements of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries with any indemnified party regarding elimination of liability indemnification of officers directors and employees and advancement of expenses in existence on the date of the fairchild agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition and c subject to certain qualifications provide to fairchild’s then current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition that is no less favorable than fairchild’s thenexisting policy or if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable the best available coverage 

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

see “legal proceedings” and note 13 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for possible contingencies related to legal matters see also “business—government regulation” for information on certain environmental matters 

sources and uses of cash 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments for research and development to make capital expenditures to repurchase our common stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments we expect interest expense to remain significant in future periods as we continue to service the debt incurred in connection with the fairchild transaction our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and with cash and cash equivalents on hand we also have the ability to utilize our revolving credit facility 

as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis during 2018 we completed the acquisition of sensl and the divestiture of the transient voltage suppressing diodes business we acquired from fairchild see note 5 “acquisitions divestitures and licensing transactions” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

 

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

 

  

 our ability to service our longterm debt including our 1625 notes 100 notes revolving credit facility and term loan “b” facility to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next 12 months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

during the ordinary course of business we evaluate our cash requirements and if necessary adjust our expenditures for inventory operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand our capital expenditures are primarily directed toward production equipment and capacity expansion our capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives for example during 2018 we paid approximately 5148 million for capital expenditures while in 2017 we paid approximately 3875 million while our capital expenditures have historically been approximately 6 to 7 of annual revenue we incurred capital expenditures of approximately 8 to 9 of annual revenue in 2018 and expect to incur similar amounts in 2019 to adjust to a higher growth environment and to further improve our manufacturing cost structure future capital expenditures may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted 

on april 15 2016 in connection with the fairchild transaction we entered into the amended credit agreement which initially provided for a 600 million revolving credit facility and a 22 billion term loan “b” facility 

on september 30 2016 we entered into the first amendment as defined below pursuant to which among other things we increased the amount that may be borrowed under the term loan “b” facility by 2000 million to 24 billion the proceeds of which were used to pay off the 2000 million outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility 

 

on march 31 2017 we completed the private unregistered offering of 5750 million aggregate principal amount of the 1625 notes which amount includes the full exercise of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase additional 1625 notes the net proceeds from the offering of the 1625 notes were used to repay 5621 million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan “b” facility 

on november 30 2017 we entered into the third amendment as defined below pursuant to which among other things we increased the amount that may be borrowed under the revolving credit facility to 10 billion in connection with the third amendment we prepaid 4000 million of borrowings under the term loan “b” facility bringing the outstanding borrowings under the term loan “b” facility to approximately 12 billion 

as of december 31 2018 there was 11345 million outstanding under the term loan “b” facility and 4000 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility the associated interest expense related to the term loan “b” facility has had and will continue to have a material impact on our results of operations throughout the term of the amended credit agreement 

we repurchased common stock worth approximately 3150 million under the 2014 share repurchase program during the year ended december 31 2018 we repurchased shares worth 250 million of our common stock under the 2014 share repurchase program in connection with the offering of the 1625 notes during the year ended december 31 2017 

cash management 

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

primary cash flow sources 

our longterm cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash our cash flows from operating activities were 12742 million 10942 million and 5811 million for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

our cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018 increased by approximately 1800 million or approximately 165 compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase was primarily attributable to better cash flows from operations and effective cash management our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on among other factors our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets 

our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below 

 

working capital 

working capital calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs in addition our working capital may be affected by acquisitions and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of longterm debt was 7674 million as of december 31 2018 and has fluctuated between 7434 million and 9410 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters our working capital including cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of longterm debt was 16985 million as of december 31 2018 and has fluctuated between 10220 million and 17823 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters 

although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives for the year ended december 31 2018 our working capital was most significantly impacted by our capital expenditures and our repayment of longterm debt including capital leases see note 9 “longterm debt” and note 10 “earnings per share and equity” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

longterm assets and liabilities 

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets deferred taxes and goodwill 

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt and deferred taxes consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans our annual funding of these obligations is at a minimum generally equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions for additional information see note 12 “employee benefit plans” and note 16 “income taxes” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

key financing and capital events 

overview

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience current and expected future conditions thirdparty evaluations and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following i estimates of future payouts for customer incentives and estimates of amounts subject to allowances returns and warranties ii measurement of valuation allowances relating to inventories iii fair values of sharebased compensation and of financial instruments including derivative financial instruments and iv measurement of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets evaluations of uncertain tax positions and impact of us tax reform additionally during periods where it becomes applicable significant estimates will be used by management in determining the future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets and in assumptions used in connection with business combinations actual results may differ from the estimates 

 

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue to a much lesser extent from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers we recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled for sales agreements we have identified the promise to transfer products each of which is distinct to be the performance obligation for product development agreements we have identified the completion of a service defined in the agreement to be the performance obligation we apply a five step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized 1 identifying the contract with a customer 2 identifying the performance obligations in the contract 3 determining the transaction price 4 allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied we allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled sales to certain distributors primarily those with ship and credit rights can be subject to price adjustment on certain products substantially all of our revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer 

prior to the first quarter of 2017 for products sold to distributors who are entitled to ship and credit rights we recognized the related revenue and cost of revenue when we were informed by the distributor that it had resold the products to the enduser this was due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effects of the returns and allowances with these distributors in anticipation of the adoption of the new revenue standard see note 3 “revenue and segment information” we had developed our internal systems processes and controls for making the required estimates on the sales to these distributors we develop an estimate of their expected claims under the ship and credit program based primarily on the historical claims submitted by product and customer which requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the amount of each claim as well as the historical period used to develop the estimate 

our oem customers do not have the right to return products other than pursuant to the provisions of the company’s standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights and stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances ship and credit claims and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue are recognized and are netted against revenue for returns we recognize a related asset for the right to recover returned products with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold we record a reserve for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenue based on the experience with each customer although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days in addition the company offers cash discounts to certain customers for payments received within an agreed upon time generally 10 days after shipment 

we have elected to record freight and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer as a fulfillment cost and include it in cost of revenue taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including valueadded and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 

 

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected enduser demand the determination of projected enduser demand requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected unit sales for each product these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory that is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved impacting our cost of revenue and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

sharebased compensation we record compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards including rsus and espps and measure them at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period determining the amount of sharebased compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grantdate fair value of the award we calculate the grantdate fair values of the award using valuation models the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of the award the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends for the past several years we have utilized rsus as our primary equity incentive compensation for employees we have outstanding awards with performance time and servicebased vesting provisions 

income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under this method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

in determining the amount of the valuation allowance estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies for each taxing jurisdiction are considered if we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 

 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made which could have a material impact to our effective tax rate see note 16 “income taxes” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information see also “management’s discussion and analysis—results of operations—income tax provision benefit” for additional information 

impairment of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable our impairment evaluation consists of a qualitative assessment and if deemed necessary a quantitative test is performed which compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets associated with that unit goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value of the net assets associated with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is considered impaired and will be determined as the amount by which the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows discount and longterm growth rates we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows the assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenue gross profit operating expenses and industry trends we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and longterm growth rates to use in its analysis we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value 

we are required to test our iprd assets for impairment annually using the guidance for indefinitelived intangible assets an iprd asset is considered to be impaired when the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its fair value our impairment evaluation consists of first assessing qualitative factors and if deemed necessary we calculate the fair value of the iprd asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount exceeds fair value we determine the fair value based on an income approach which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the iprd asset the assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenue gross profit operating expenses and industry trends 

 

we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding iprd whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount impairment losses if applicable are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests 

business combination we use significant estimates and assumptions in allocating the purchase price of acquired business by utilizing established valuation techniques appropriate for the technology industry we utilize the income approach cost approach or market approach depending upon which approach is the most appropriate based on the nature and reliability of available data the income approach is predicated upon the value of the future cash flows that an asset is expected to generate over its economic life and involves significant assumptions as to cash flows associated expenses longterm growth rates and discount rates the cost approach takes into account the cost to replace or reproduce the asset and involves assumptions relating to the asset’s value of physical functional andor economic obsolescence that has occurred with respect to the asset the market approach is used to estimate value from an analysis of actual transactions or offerings for economically comparable assets available as of the valuation date 

contingencies  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

as of december 31 2018 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 29390 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 22954 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 6436 million balance of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2018 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately 32 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase we entered into interest rate swaps to hedge some of the risk of variability in cash flows resulting from future interest payments on our variable interest rate debt under the term loan “b” facility 

 

to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures from an accounting and economic perspective however given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged we cannot provide any assurances that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the united states dollar as a normal part of the reporting process some of our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a nonfunctional currency changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged the notional amount of foreign currency contracts at december 31 2018 and 2017 was 1573 million and 1305 million respectively our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies including japanese yen euros korean won malaysian ringgit philippines peso singapore dollars swiss francs chinese renminbi and czech koruna due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the us dollar for example we determined that based on a hypothetical weightedaverage change of 10 in currency exchange rates our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately 1029 million for the year ended december 31 2018 assuming no interrelationship between the currencies

customers 

in general we have maintained longterm relationships with our key customers sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty 

 

and supply but typically do not require minimum purchase commitments most of our oem customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year while our other customers including electronic manufacturer service providers and distributors generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of endmarkets including computing automotive consumer industrial communications networking aerospacedefense and medical for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we had no sales to individual customers including distributors that accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues 

for the year ended december 31 2017 aggregate revenue from our five largest customers per segment for our power solutions group analog solutions group and image sensor group comprised approximately 43 35 and 48 respectively of our total consolidated revenue the loss of certain of these customers may have a material adverse effect on the operations of the respective segment 

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications our standard warranty extends for a period of two years from the date of delivery except in the case of image sensor products which are warrantied for one year from the date of delivery generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days prior to shipment for custom products without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog and inventory” below 

 

endmarkets for our products 

the following table sets forth our principal endmarkets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each endmarket during 2017 sample applications for our products and representative oem customers and endusers we include the data relating to the medical aerospace and defense endmarkets as part of our industrial endmarket and the data relating to the networking and wireless endmarkets as part of our communications endmarket 

 

  

oems direct sales to oems accounted for approximately 34 of our revenues in 2017 38 of our revenues in 2016 and 39 of our revenues in 2015 oem customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as bosch gmbh continental automotive systems delphi hella huawei technologies co ltd magna international panasonic corporation and samsung electronics co ltd “samsung” we focus on three types of oems multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core oem customers the target market customers for our endmarkets are oems that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our oem customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our standard warranty 

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 60 of our revenues in 2017 56 of our revenues in 2016 and 54 of our revenues in 2015 the yearoveryear increase being attributed to our acquisition of fairchild which had a greater distribution mix than our historical business our distributors which include arrow avnet macnica os electronics world peace and wt microelectronics resell to midsized and smaller oems and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to certain distributors are made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with certain of our distributors contain stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns we developed our new internal processes and systems which have enabled us to reliably estimate upfront the effects of returns and allowances and thus began recognizing revenue at the time of sales to the distributors beginning in the first quarter of 2017 prior to 2017 for products sold to distributors who are entitled to returns and allowances generally referred to as “ship and credit rights” we recognized related revenues and cost of revenues when we were informed by the distributors that they had resold the products to the enduser 

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 6 of our revenues in 2017 6 of our revenues in 2016 and 7 of our revenues in 2015 among our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are benchmark electronic flextronics jabil and sanmina  these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for oems originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many oems now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace generally our electronic manufacturing service customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our standard warranty 

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 18 “segment information” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for revenues by geographic locations 

manufacturing operations 

we operate frontend wafer fabrication facilities in belgium czech republic japan korea malaysia and the united states and backend assembly and test site facilities in canada china japan malaysia philippines vietnam and the united states in addition to these frontend and backend manufacturing operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 

 

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture with leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited a joint venture company in which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests “leshan” as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities along with the approximate gross square footage of each site’s building which includes among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

 

  

1 these facilities are leased 

2 this facility is used for both frontend and backend operations 

3 these facilities are located on leased land 

4 one building owned and a portion of another leased 

we operate all of our manufacturing facilities directly with the exception of our assembly and test operations facility located in leshan china which is owned by leshan our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is formerly a stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 80 of leshan’s production capacity in each of 2017 2016 and 2015 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 80 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2018 

we use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to 

 

forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including amkor ase kingpak smic tpsco and tsmc collectively accounted for approximately 36 36 and 39 of our manufacturing costs in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

for information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations see “risk factors  trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” included elsewhere in this form 10k

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and significant downturns or upturns in customer demand can materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and as a result is subject to significant downturns and upturns in customer demand for semiconductors and related products we cannot accurately predict the timing of future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry or how severe and prolonged these conditions might be significant downturns often occur in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used or declines in general economic conditions and can result in reduced product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results as a result of increased operating expenses outpacing decreased revenue reduced margins underutilization of our manufacturing capacity andor asset impairment charges on the other hand significant upturns can cause us to be unable to satisfy demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in the event of such an upturn we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

rapid innovation and short product life cycles in the semiconductor industry can result in price erosion of older products which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid innovation and short product life cycles which often results in price erosion especially with respect to products containing older technology products are frequently replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes and as demand for older technology falls the price at which such products can be sold drops in some cases precipitously in addition our and our competitors’ excess inventory levels can accelerate general price erosion 

in order to continue to profitably supply older products we must offset lower prices by reducing production costs typically through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies if we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our production efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of older products moreover we may not be able to cease production of older products either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products for a sustained period of time if reductions in our production costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts often in markets or regions in which we have less experience than others our decision to pursue an acquisition is based on among other factors our estimates of expected future earnings growth and potential cost savings for example we may anticipate rationalization of a combined infrastructure and savings through integration of a newly acquired business into our business and our estimates could turn out to be incorrect risks related to successful integration of an acquisition include but are not limited to 1 the ability to integrate information technology and other systems 2 unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence 3 customers responding by changing their existing business relationships with us or the acquired company 4 diversion of management’s attention from our day to day operations and 5 loss of key employees due to uncertainty about positions postintegration in addition we may incur unexpected costs such as operating or restructuring costs including severance payments to departing employees or taxes resulting from the acquisition or integration of the newly acquired business in the past we have recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions as a result of such factors as significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results missteps or delays in integrating our acquisitions which could be caused by factors outside of our control or our failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions on the timeline we anticipate or at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

depending on the level of our ownership interest in and the extent to which we can exercise control over the acquired business we may be required by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and sec rules and regulations to consolidate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements such statements may not be prepared in accordance with gaap or the acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems any of which could materially impair our ability to properly integrate such businesses into our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis any revisions to 

 

inaccuracies in or restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to accounting for our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain manufacturing efficiency which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing requires advanced equipment and significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs which include depreciation expense manufacturing semiconductor components also involves highly complex processes that we and our competitors are continuously modifying to improve yields and product performance in addition impurities waste or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower production yields our manufacturing efficiency is and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or be successful in our manufacturing rationalization plans if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at expected levels or if production capacity increases while revenues do not the fixed costs and other operating expenses associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

downturns or volatility in general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in recent years worldwide semiconductor industry sales have tracked the impact of the financial crisis subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty we believe that the state of economic conditions in the united states is particularly uncertain due to likely shifts in legislative and regulatory conditions concerning among other matters international trade and taxation and that an uneven recovery or a renewed global downturn may put pressure on our sales due to reductions in customer demand as well as customers deferring purchases volatile andor uncertain economic conditions can adversely impact sales and profitability and make it difficult for us and our competitors to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected we may face oversupply of our products relative to customer demand in the past reduced customer spending has driven us and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which results in a negative effect on gross profit moreover volatility in revenues as a result of unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our shortterm and longterm strategies to the extent that our sales profitability and strategies are negatively affected by downturns or volatility in general economic conditions our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

if our technologies are subject to claims of infringement on the ip rights of third parties efforts to address such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may from time to time be subject to claims that we may be infringing thirdparty ip rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such ip rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for ip we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring such technologies further we may be subject to ip litigation which could cause us to incur significant expense materially adversely affect sales of the challenged product or 

 

technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

 

      there are several civil litigation proceedings with power integrations inc “pi” many of which were pending prior to the fairchild transaction and there are also over two dozen outstanding administrative proceedings between the parties at the united states patent and trademark office the “uspto” in which each party is challenging the validity of the other party’s patents please see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a more detailed description of the litigation and related administrative matters with pi and other legal matters we are currently engaged in 

the outcome of ip litigation is inherently uncertain and if not resolved in our favor could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our facilities and processes are interdependent and an operational disruption at any particular facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce many of our products which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we utilize an integrated manufacturing platform in which multiple facilities may each produce one or more components necessary for the assembly of a single product as a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities an operational disruption at a facility toward the frontend of our manufacturing process may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products for example our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers used by a number of our facilities and any operational disruption natural or manmade disaster or other extraordinary event that impacted the roznov facility would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce a number of our products worldwide in the event of a disruption at any such facility we may be unable to effectively source replacement components on acceptable terms from qualified third parties in which case our ability to produce many of our products could be materially disrupted or delayed conversely many of our facilities are single source facilities that only produce one of our endproducts and a disruption at any such facility would materially delay or cease production of the related product in the event of any such operational disruption we may experience difficulty in beginning production of replacement components or products at new facilities for example due to construction delays or transferring production to other existing facilities for example due to capacity constraints or difficulty in transitioning to new manufacturing processes any of which could result in a loss of future revenues and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the failure to successfully implement cost reduction initiatives including through restructuring activities could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

from time to time we have implemented cost reduction initiatives in response to significant downturns in our industry including relocating manufacturing to lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to 

 

internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to lower costs implementing personnel reductions and voluntary retirement programs reducing employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs have been primarily composed of employee separation costs including severance payments and asset impairments we also often undertake restructuring activities and programs to improve our cost structure in connection with our business acquisitions which can result in significant charges including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges 

we cannot assure you that our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the associated cost reductions could materially adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position to the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other benefits of our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives that we anticipate our results of operations may be materially adversely effected 

if we are unable to identify and make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process and often requires significant capital investment and lead time for development and testing we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive in addition the lengthy development cycle for our products limits our ability to adapt quickly to changes affecting the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers there can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” for new products in addition design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or that we will generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments as expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured there is no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop new products that a significant investment in new products will be profitable or that we will have margins as high as we anticipate at the time of investment or have experienced historically to the extent that we underinvest in our research and development efforts or that our investments and capital expenditures in research and development do not lead to sales of new products we may be unable to bring to market technologies and products that are attractive to our customers and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to develop new products to satisfy changing customer demands or regulatory requirements which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies evolving regulatory and industry standards and certifications changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions our success is largely dependent on our ability to accurately predict identify and adapt to changes affecting the requirements of our customers in a timely and costeffective manner additionally the emergence of new industry or regulatory 

 

standards and certification requirements may adversely affect the demand for our products we focus our independent new product development efforts on market segments and applications that we anticipate will experience growth but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying highgrowth areas or develop products that meet industry standards or certification requirements in a timely manner a fundamental shift in technologies the regulatory climate or consumption patterns and preferences in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could make our current products obsolete prevent or delay the introduction of new products that we planned to make or render our current or new products irrelevant to our customers’ needs if our new product development efforts fail to align with the needs of our customers including due to circumstances outside of our control like a fundamental shift in the product markets of our customers and end users or regulatory changes our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

uncertainties regarding the timing and amount of customer orders could lead to excess inventory and writedowns of inventory that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers requiring a commitment to purchase generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days for custom products without incurring a significant penalty we routinely generate inventory based on customers’ estimates of enduser demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties which may vary significantly in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction of products due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers unsold inventory canceled orders and cancellation penalties may materially adversely affect our results of operations and inventory writedowns may materially adversely affect our financial condition 

if we do not have access to capital on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we require a substantial amount of capital to meet our operating requirements and remain competitive we routinely incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency to upgrade equipment and to expand production capacity and there can be no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended we have incurred and may continue to incur material amounts of debt to fund these requirements significant volatility or disruption in the global financial markets may result in us not being able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all and we may not be able to refinance if necessary any outstanding debt when due all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition any inability to obtain additional funding on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all may cause us to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or obtain funds through arrangements that management does not currently anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies the occurrence of any of which may significantly impair our ability to remain competitive if our operating results falter our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fully customized ics as well as from customers who develop their own ic products in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

our inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations products or technologies developed by competitors that are larger and have more substantial research and development budgets or that are smaller and more targeted in their development efforts may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive we also may be unable to market and sell our products if they are not competitive on the basis of price quality technical performance features system compatibility customized design innovation availability delivery timing and reliability if we fail to compete effectively on developing strategic relationships with customers and customer sales and technical support our sales and revenues may be materially adversely affected competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise prices and any inability to maintain revenues or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a significant adverse effect on our gross margin reduced sales and lower gross margins would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry has experienced rapid consolidation and our inability to compete with large competitors or failure to identify attractive opportunities to consolidate may materially adversely affect our business 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by the high costs associated with developing marketable products and manufacturing technologies as well as high levels of investment in production capabilities as a result the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including but not limited to substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition in addition we may be at a competitive disadvantage to our peers if we fail to identify attractive opportunities to acquire companies to expand our business consolidation among our competitors and integration among our customers could erode our market share negatively impact our capacity to compete and require us to restructure our operations any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

natural disasters and other business disruptions could cause significant harm to our business operations and facilities and could adversely affect our supply chain and our customer base any of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition 

our us and international manufacturing facilities and distribution centers as well as the operations of our thirdparty suppliers are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods hurricanes earthquakes typhoons and similar natural disasters as well as power outages telecommunications failures industrial accidents and similar events the occurrence of natural disasters in any of the regions in which we operate could severely 

 

disrupt the operations of our businesses by negatively impacting our supply chain our ability to deliver products and the cost of our products such events can negatively impact revenues and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event in addition these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the us and worldwide economies although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms to the extent any losses from natural disasters or other business disruptions are not covered by insurance any costs writedowns impairments and decreased revenues can materially adversely affect our business our results of operations and our financial condition 

the loss of one of our largest customers or a significant reduction in the revenue we generate from these customers could materially adversely affect our revenues profitability and results of operations 

product sales to our ten largest customers have historically accounted for a significant amount of our business for instance for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 revenue from our 10 largest endcustomers collectively represented approximately 24 and 24 respectively of our total revenues for those years many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that our largest customers will not cease purchasing products from us in favor of products produced by other suppliers significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future and any such event could have a material adverse effect on our revenues profitability and results of operations 

because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the automotive industrial and communications industries a downturn or lower sales to customers in either industry could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

a significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive industrial including medical aerospace and defense and communications industries including networking sales into these industries represented approximately 31 25 and 20 of our revenue respectively for the year ended december 31 2017 and those percentages will vary from quarter to quarter each of the automotive industrial and communications industries is cyclical and as a result our customers in these industries are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions disruptive innovation and endmarket preferences which can adversely affect sales of our products and correspondingly our results of operations additionally the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in these industries could decline despite continued growth in their respective end markets lower sales to customers in the automotive industrial or communications industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

shortages or increased prices of raw materials could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including various chemicals and gases polysilicon silicon wafers aluminum gold silver copper lead frames mold compound and ceramic packages generally our agreements with suppliers of raw materials impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers of raw materials may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors beyond our control shortages could occur in various essential raw materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner 

 

the costs of our raw materials increases significantly their quality deteriorates or they give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent on the services of thirdparty suppliers and contract manufacturers and any disruption in or deterioration of the quality of the services delivered by such third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use thirdparty contractors for certain of our manufacturing activities primarily wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to commit to purchase services based on forecasted product needs which may be inaccurate and in some cases require longerterm commitments we are also dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized thirdparty suppliers for required components and materials for certain of our key technologies arranging for replacement manufacturers and suppliers can be time consuming and costly and the number of qualified alternative providers can be extremely limited our business operations productivity and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasted needs proved to be materially incorrect 

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant amount of our total revenue outside of the us is derived from the asiapacific region and europe and we maintain significant operations in these regions in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

 

               

 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets the materialization of any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates or the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or have exposure to additional tax liabilities which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

changes to income tax regulations in the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could under our existing tax structure significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition other factors or events including business combinations and investment transactions changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns or as a result of deficiencies asserted by taxing authorities increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in available tax credits increasing operations in high tax jurisdictions and changes in tax rates could also increase our future effective tax rate 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service the “irs” and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these changes if adopted by countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes 

the impact of new us tax legislation is uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation hr1 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code and it will take time for additional clarifying guidance and legislation to be issued and this guidance will be required for the interpretation of these comprehensive changes based on our current understanding of the law following a preliminary review we estimated significant impacts to our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings the impact of the tax act may differ from this estimate possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made guidance that may be issued and actions the company may take as a result of the tax act 

the tax act could have a material benefit or material adverse impact and could result in volatility in our effective tax rate tax expense and cash flow we are in the process of analyzing the potential aggregate current 

 

and future impacts of the tax act relative to how we do business cash flows and results of operations any benefit associated with the lower us corporate tax rate could be reduced or outweighed by other adverse changes enacted in the tax act or by the cost of compliance 

we operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies andor legal entity structures which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are therefore subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties there is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results or operations and cash flows 

our legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations changes in tax laws regulations future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in us becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

currency fluctuations changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sizeable sales and operations in the asiapacific region and europe and a significant amount of this business is transacted in currency other than us dollars in addition while a significant percentage of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside the us many of our liabilities including our outstanding indebtedness and certain other cash payments such as share repurchases are payable in us dollars as a result currency fluctuations and changes in foreign exchange regulations can have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

in addition repatriation of funds held outside the us could have adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay due to required local country approvals or local obligations from time to time we are required to make cash deposits outside of the us to support bank guarantees of our obligations under certain office leases or amounts we owe to certain vendors and such cash deposits are not available for other uses as long as the related bank guarantees are outstanding foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency as a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the us our financial flexibility may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations restrictions on repatriation or the inability to use cash held abroad to fund our operations in the us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

 

we may be unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 

our success depends on our ability to attract motivate and retain highly skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel both in the us and internationally in the semiconductor industry the competition for qualified personnel particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees is intense particularly when the business cycle is improving during such periods competitors may try to recruit our most valuable technical employees while we devote a great deal of our attention to designing competitive compensation programs aimed at attracting and retaining personnel specific elements of our compensation programs may not be competitive with those of our competitors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and on our business 

if we must reduce our use of equity awards to compensate our employees our competitiveness in the employee marketplace could be adversely affected and our results of operations could vary as a result of changes in our stockbased compensation programs 

we have issued in the past and expect to continue to issue rsus with timebased vesting performancebased awards and common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time as compensation tools while this is a routine practice in many parts of the world foreign exchange and income tax regulations in some countries make this practice more and more difficult such regulations tend to diminish the value of equity compensation to our employees in those countries our current practice is to seek stockholder approval of new or amendments to existing equity compensation plans if these proposals do not receive stockholder approval we may not be able to grant equity awards to employees at the same levels as in the past which could materially adversely affect our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel thereby materially adversely affecting our business in addition changes in forecasted stockbased compensation expense could cause our results of operations to vary by impacting our gross margin percentage research and development expenses marketing general and administrative expenses and our tax rate 

disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could materially harm our business and reputation 

currently certain of our us employees in pennsylvania are represented by labor unions in addition we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to production slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in a loss of business and material damage to our reputation in addition union activity and compliance with international labor standards could result in higher labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the enforceability of our patents trademarks copyrights software licenses and other ip is uncertain in certain circumstances effective ip protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the us and internationally the various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered ip assets patents 

 

trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts with respect to our ip generally we cannot assure you that 

 

    when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights of its own against us which may materially adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications we seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to ip arising out of our research should we be unable to protect our ip competitors may develop products or technologies that duplicate our products or technologies benefit financially from innovations for which we bore the costs of development and undercut the sales and marketing of our products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

environmental and health and safety liabilities and expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground and we have been identified as either a primary responsible party or a potentially responsible party at sites where we or our predecessors operated or disposed of waste in the past our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other requirements regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances we have indemnities from third parties for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities for periods prior to our operations at some of our current and past sites and we have also purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance will cover any or all of our material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities including 

 

  

    to the extent that we face unforeseen environmental or health and safety compliance costs or remediation expenses or liabilities that are not covered by indemnities or insurance we may bear the full effect of such costs expense and liabilities which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards 

like most publicly traded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm as we continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future 

there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future failure to comply with sox including delaying or failing to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such transactions and the trading price of our common stock or other securities may decline in addition if we fail to remedy any material weakness our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements our financial statements may be materially inaccurate our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process requiring production in a tightly controlled clean environment minute impurities in our manufacturing materials contaminants in the manufacturing environment manufacturing equipment failures and other defects can cause our products to be noncompliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in 

 

their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in electrical design oems are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage if any and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall could have material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them and claims for consequential damages against our customers from their customers we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved in certain instances we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective and to the extent that we are liable for damages in excess of the revenues and profits we received from the products involved our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could irreparably damage our reputation and our business expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we routinely collect and store sensitive data including ip and other proprietary information about our business and our customers suppliers and business partners the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses illegal hacking criminal fraud or impersonation acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error our security measures andor those of our third party service providers andor customers may not detect or prevent such security breaches the costs to us to reduce the risk of or alleviate cyber security breaches and vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may materially impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions any such compromise of our information security could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business an interruption in our operations the unauthorized transfer of cash or other of our assets the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws in addition computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities and any such attack if successful could expose us to liability to customer claims any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

sales through distributors and other third parties expose us to risks that if realized could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face risks related to our sale of a significant and increasing portion of our products through distributors distributors may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the fcpa or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our 

 

business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our contracts could result in among other things damages fines or other liabilities 

we have a diverse customer base consisting of both private sector clients and public sector clients including the us government sales to our private sector clients are generally based on stated contractual terms the terms and conditions on our website or terms contained in purchase orders on a transactionbytransaction basis sales to our public sector clients are generally derived from sales to federal state and local governmental departments and agencies through various contracts and programs which may require compliance with regulations covering many areas of our operations including but not limited to accounting practices ip rights information handling and security noncompliance with contract terms particularly with respect to highlyregulated public sector clients or with government procurement regulations could result in fines or penalties against us termination of such contracts or civil criminal and administrative liability to the company with respect to public sector clients the government’s remedies may also include suspension or debarment from future government business in addition almost all of our contracts have default provisions and certain of our contracts in the public sector are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency the effect of any of these possible actions or the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations or practices could materially adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

the company is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future the company collects personally identifiable information “pii” and other data as part of its business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of us and international laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union and other relevant jurisdictions where the company conducts business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are currently more restrictive than those in the us additionally in may 2016 the european union adopted the general data protection regulation that will impose more stringent data protection requirements and will provide for greater penalties for noncompliance beginning in may 2018 while the company has developed and is executing plans to meet these requirements these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect implementation any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or to comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to the company or company officials damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial debt could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2017 we had 31750 million of outstanding indebtedness we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future to repay or refinance other outstanding debt to make acquisitions or for 

 

other purposes and if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

 

           to the extent that we continue to maintain or expand our significant indebtedness our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

indebtedness incurred in connection with the fairchild transaction could materially and adversely affect us by among other things limiting our ability to conduct our operations and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

in connection with our acquisition of fairchild we entered into the amended credit agreement providing for our 10 billion revolving credit facility which provides liquidity to us and the 24 billion term loan “b” facility which was used to fund the acquisition of fairchild the obligations under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the personal property and material real property assets of the company and most of the company’s domestic subsidiaries as a result if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the amended credit agreement the lenders could take possession of and foreclose on the pledged collateral securing the indebtedness in which case we would be at risk of losing the related collateral which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations in addition subject to customary exceptions the amended credit agreement requires mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances which may result in prepaying outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility and the term loan “b” facility rather than using funds for other business purposes our acquisitionrelated financing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition including among other things our ability to obtain 

 

additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and could reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

the agreements relating to our indebtedness including the amended credit agreement may restrict our ability to operate our business and as a result may materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our debt agreements including the amended credit agreement contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to 

 

           such agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them to the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations our financial condition may be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us to the extent that we are unable to engage in activities that support the growth profitability and competitiveness of our business our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations and any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations as they come due we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect furthermore we cannot assure you that if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing 

 

that indebtedness which could materially negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition a default under our committed credit facilities including our amended credit agreement could also limit our ability to make further borrowings under those facilities which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to the current stockholders 

an event of default under any agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness could cross default other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness any such cross default would put immediate pressure on our liquidity and financial condition and would amplify the risks described above with regards to being unable to repay our indebtedness when due and payable we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our operating subsidiaries which may have no independent obligation to repay our debt are not able to make cash available to us for such repayment our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if interest rates increase our debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could increase significantly which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

borrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time including under our amended credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and as a result expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease during the first quarter of 2017 we entered into interest rate swaps that involved the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility for a portion of our term loan “b” facility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk to the extent the risk materializes and is not fully mitigated the resulting increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

servicing the 100 notes and 1625 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 100 notes and 1625 notes in a timely manner 

in june 2015 we issued 6900 million aggregate principal amount of our 100 notes and in march 2017 we issued 5750 million aggregate principal amount of our 1625 notes holders of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined under the respective indentures governing such notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change repurchase date in addition upon conversion of the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes to be repurchased unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares we will be required to make cash payments in respect of such 100 notes andor 1625 notes being converted moreover we will be required to repay the 100 notes and the 1625 notes in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted or repurchased servicing the 100 notes and the1625 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 100 notes and the 1625 notes our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes repurchase the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes in the event of a fundamental change or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would dilute existing stockholders in addition if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the 100 notes andor the 1625 notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of such notes which could cross default other debt and materially adversely harm our business the terms of the amended credit agreement limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur but the terms of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above our decision to use our cash for other purposes such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock could also intensify these risks 

the conditional conversion feature of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and if we elect to settle the conversion of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes in common stock any such settlement could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

if specified conditions are met holders of the 100 notes may convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding september 1 2020 and holders of the 1625 notes may convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding july 15 2023 unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligations by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares in the event the conditional conversion feature under either the 100 notes or the 1625 notes is triggered holders electing to convert their notes could require us to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligations through the payment of cash which could materially adversely affect our liquidity alternatively if the conditional conversion feature under either the 100 notes or the 1625 notes is triggered and holders do not elect to convert their notes we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of such notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital any material decrease in our liquidity or reduction in our net working capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we may elect to settle a conversion of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes solely in common stock to avoid an event of default under our amended credit agreement and 

 

any such issuance of common stock could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders including stockholders who previously converted such notes to shares of our common stock 

the fundamental change repurchase feature of our 100 notes and 1625 notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company 

the terms of our 100 notes and 1625 notes require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined under the respective indentures governing such notes in certain circumstances a takeover of our company could trigger an option of the holders of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes to require us to repurchase such notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors in the 100 notes and the 1625 notes and our common stock which could materially decrease the value of such notes and of our common stock 

note hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

concurrently with the issuance of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions which we refer to as the option counterparties the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the respective series of notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes of such series as the case may be we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds 2596 with respect to the 100 notes and 3070 with respect to the 1625 notes 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock andor entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock following the pricing of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes respectively the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 100 notes and the 1625 notes respectively and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 100 notes or 1625 notes following any repurchase of the 100 notes or 1625 notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions if realized could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we are subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral if one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions 

 

to the extent the option counterparties do not honor their contractual commitments with us pursuant to the note hedge transactions we could face a material increase in our exposure to potential dilution upon any conversion of the 100 notes or the 1625 notes andor cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 100 notes or 1625 notes as the case may be our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock in addition upon a default by one of the option counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences with respect to our common stock any such adverse tax consequences or increased cash payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may impact the value of our common stock a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter in addition to the other factors described above factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

 

              an adverse change or development in any of the above factors could cause the market price of common stock to materially decline 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors 

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors among others some of which are beyond our control 

 

       the trading price of our common stock in the past has had significant variance and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

 

   although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders any delay or prevention of an acquisition of our company that would have been beneficial to our stockholders could materially decrease the value of our common stock

executive overview 

this executive overview presents summarized information regarding our industry markets business and operating trends only for further information relating to the information summarized herein see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in its entirety 

 

industry overview 

according to wsts an industry research firm worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 4122 billion in 2017 an increase of approximately 216 from 3389 billion in 2016 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our serviceable addressable market “sam” since 2013 

 

  

  

 as indicated above worldwide semiconductor sales increased from 3056 billion in 2013 to 4122 billion in 2017 the increase of 216 from 2016 to 2017 reflected improving macroeconomic conditions in the second half of 2017 sales in our sam increased from 1043 billion in 2013 to 1337 billion in 2017 the increase of 124 from 2016 to 2017 is consistent with the trend in the worldwide semiconductor market the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our sam of approximately 50 for the next three years these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have reduced or shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have caused demand to strengthen production volumes have historically stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand reaches levels above capacity production capabilities shortages begin to occur which typically causes pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle

we believe that some of the key factors and trends affecting our results of operations include but not limited to 

 

         fairchild acquisition 

on september 19 2016 we completed the fairchild transaction the purchase price totaled 25322 million and was funded by the borrowings against our term loan “b” facility and a partial draw of our revolving revolving credit facility and with cash on hand 

 

we believe that this acquisition has created a power semiconductor leader with strong capabilities in a rapidly consolidating semiconductor industry the combination of fairchild operations with our own has provided complementary product lines to offer customers the full spectrum of high medium and low voltage products and we will continue to pioneer technology and design innovation in efficient energy consumption to help our customers achieve success and drive value for our partners and employees around the world the acquisition also expanded our footprint in wireless communication products particularly in high efficiency power conversions and usb type c communication and power delivery see “business  2016 acquisition activity” “risk factors” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional information see note 4 “acquisitions divestitures and licensing transactions” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

recent on semiconductor results 

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 were 55431 million an increase of approximately 419 from 39069 million from the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of fairchild during 2017 we reported net income attributable to on semiconductor of 8107 million compared to 1821 million in 2016 the increase was attributable to the impact of the us tax reform as well as improved results and contributions from the acquired fairchild business our gross margin increased by approximately 350 basis points to 367 in 2017 from 332 in 2016 the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher factory utilization product mix and contributions from the acquired fairchild business 

on semiconductor q1 2018 outlook 

based upon product booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we estimate that our revenues will be approximately 13400 to 13900 million gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be approximately 364 to 384 operating expenses will be approximately 3180 to 3360 million other income and expense including interest expense net will be approximately 330 to 360 million and diluted share count will be approximately 4450 to 4470 million in the first quarter of 2018 

statements related to our outlook for the first quarter of 2018 are based on our current expectations forecasts estimates and assumptions such statements involve risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forwardlooking statements see “risk factors” for additional information 

business and macroeconomic environment influence on cost savings and restructuring activities 

in 2017 our initiatives were focused on synergyrelated cost reductions from the fairchild acquisition additionally we have historically pursued and expect to continue to pursue other costsaving initiatives to align our overall cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our expected revenue spending and capacity levels based on our current sales and manufacturing projections we have recognized efficiencies from previously implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions we have historically taken significant actions to align our overall cost structure with our expectations of market conditions and by focusing on synergiesrelated cost reductions arising from each of our acquisitions however there can be no assurances that we will adequately forecast economic conditions or that we will effectively align our cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our revenue spending and capacity levels in the future 

 

see “results of operations  restructuring asset impairments and other net” below along with note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information relating to our most recent costsaving initiatives 

anticipated impact of us tax reform 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax act the tax act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requires companies to pay a one time mandatory repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain future foreign earnings our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017 includes a provisional income tax benefit of 4499 million as a result of the tax act this benefit includes charges related to the mandatory repatriation tax and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets for the new lower us statutory rate of 21 offset by a reduction of our deferred tax liability for undistributed current and prior years’ earnings of our foreign subsidiaries our provisional estimate of the mandatory repatriation tax is 2194 million which we believe can be offset in part by 1911 million of existing us tax credit carryforwards after utilization of our tax credits the remaining cash tax payable is expected to be 283 million which would be payable over eight years with 23 million due in 2018 

we expect our future effective tax rate to more approximate the new us federal statutory rate of 21 the change in our future effective tax rate is not anticipated to have an effect on our cash tax until all of our us federal net operating losses and credits have been utilized 

results of operations 

our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2017 include the full year results of operations from our acquisition of fairchild on september 19 2016 

 

operating results 

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 in millions 

 

 revenues

other income and expenses 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased by 41 million or approximately 28 to 1412 million during 2017 compared to 1453 million in 2016 primarily due to the interest rate reduction under our amended credit agreement interest expense increased by 956 million or approximately 192 to 1453 million during 2016 up from 497 million in 2015 primarily due to the substantial indebtedness incurred in order to acquire fairchild we expect interest expense to remain substantial in future periods as we service the debt we incurred in connection with the fairchild transaction we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of 308 million 260 million and 175 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively our average gross amount of longterm debt balance including current maturities during 2017 2016 and 2015 was 34909 million 26613 million and 13616 million respectively our weighted average interest rate on our gross amount of longterm debt including current maturities was approximately 40 55 and 37 per annum in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources  key financing and capital events” below and note 8 “longterm debt” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a description of the indebtedness incurred for the fairchild transaction and our refinancing activities

loss on debt refinancing and prepayment 

loss on debt refinancing and prepayment increased by 409 million from 63 million in 2016 to 472 million to 2017 the loss relates to the 1 expensing of 262 million of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs attributed to the partial pay down of 5750 million and the repricing of the term loan “b” facility for the second amendment as defined below 2 expensing of 67 million of unamortized debt discount costs attributed to the partial pay down of 2000 million of term loan “b” facility and 3 expensing of 143 million of unamortized debt discount and unamortized issuance costs attributed to the partial pay down of 4000 million and the repricing of term loan “b” facility for the third amendment to the amended credit agreement the “third amendment” see note 8 “longterm debt” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

loss on debt refinancing and prepayment increased by 59 million from 04 million in 2015 to 63 million in 2016 due to the execution of the first amendment as defined below which resulted in a debt extinguishment charge of 47 million and the termination and replacement of our senior revolving credit facility by the revolving credit facility which resulted in a debt modification and writeoff of 16 million in unamortized debt issuance costs 

during 2015 we amended our senior revolving credit facility to among other things increase the borrowing capacity to 10 billion and reset the facility’s five year maturity as a result of the amendment we wroteoff 04 million of existing debt issuance costs associated with the facility 

other expense income

licensing income 

licensing income was 476 million for 2017 compared to zero for 2016 approximately 451 million was attributable to payments received under an asset purchase agreement with hset electronic tech hong kong limited in connection with our licensing of certain patents related to the mobile cis business the remaining 25 million was received from various other licensing agreements see note 4 “acquisitions divestitures and licensing transactions” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

income tax provision benefit 

we recorded an income tax benefit of 2655 million an income tax benefit of 39 million and an income tax provision of 108 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

this income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017 consisted primarily of the provisional benefit of 4499 million related to the estimated impact of us tax reform and related effects and a discrete benefit of 132 million relating to equity award excess tax benefits these benefits are offset by 1868 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic current year operations and 108 million relating to the establishment of additional valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets 

the income tax benefit for 2016 consisted primarily of the reversal of 3598 million of our previously established valuation allowance against part of our us federal and foreign deferred tax assets and the release of 19 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2016 this was partially offset by 3108 million related to the reversal of the prior years’ indefinite reinvestment assertion 435 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations and 35 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions 

the income tax provision for 2015 consisted of the reversal of 121 million of our previously established valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets the release of 43 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions that were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2015 and a change in tax rate that favorably impacted deferred balances by 16 million this is partially offset by 244 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations and 44 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions 

our effective tax rate for 2017 was a benefit of 485 which differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 primarily due to us tax reform codified under the tax act our effective tax rate for 2016 was a benefit of 22 which differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the release of our us and japan valuation allowances partially offset by the reversal of the prior years’ indefinite reinvestment assertion our effective tax rate for 2015 was a provision of 49 which differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 primarily due to our change in valuation allowance deemed dividend income from foreign subsidiaries and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries 

we expect our future effective tax rate to more approximate the new us federal statutory rate of 21 the change in our future effective tax rate is not anticipated to have an effect on our cash tax until all of our us federal net operating losses and credits have been utilized 

we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on a portion of our tax credits in foreign jurisdictions and foreign net operating losses a substantial portion of which relate to japan net operating losses which are projected to expire prior to utilization in addition we also maintain a full valuation allowance on our us state deferred tax assets

liquidity and capital resources 

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements offbalance sheet arrangements contingencies sources and uses of cash operations working capital and longterm assets and liabilities 

contractual obligations 

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt capital leases operating leases and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2017 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

 

  

   the table also excludes our pension obligations we expect to make cash contributions to comply with local funding requirements and required benefit payments of approximately 164 million in 2018 this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2018 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations see note 11 “employee benefit plans” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information on our pension obligations 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 9492 million as of december 31 2017 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months total cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2017 include approximately 4224 million available in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt service debt repayments and acquisitions while we hold a significant amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries we have the ability to obtain cash in the united states through distributions from our foreign subsidiaries in order to cover our domestic needs by utilizing existing credit facilities or through new bank loans or debt obligations 

 

see note 8 “longterm debt” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a discussion of our longterm debt see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” included elsewhere in this form 10k for a discussion of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and our stock repurchase activities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

in the ordinary course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us as required for transactions including but not limited to material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases utilities or customs guarantees our revolving credit facility includes 150 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit there were 04 million letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017 which reduces our borrowing capacity we also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility of 57 million at december 31 2017 

as part of securing financing in the ordinary course of business we issued guarantees related to certain of our capital lease obligations equipment financing lines of credit and real estate mortgages which totaled 1206 million as of december 31 2017 we are also a guarantor of sci llc’s noncollateralized loan with smbc which had a balance of 1227 million as of december 31 2017 and which was fully repaid on january 2 2018 see note 8 “longterm debt” and note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements for the foreseeable future 

for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and similarly incur expenses totaling 1605 million as payments come due we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases letters of credit and guarantee arrangements see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

contingencies 

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to ip infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in economic damage bodily injury or property damage in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims 

 

we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities including certain liabilities under the exchange act that might be incurred by any director or officer in his or her capacity as such 

the fairchild agreement provides for indemnification and insurance rights in favor of fairchild’s then current and former directors officers and employees specifically the company has agreed that for no fewer than six years following the fairchild acquisition the company will a indemnify and hold harmless each such indemnitee against losses and expenses including advancement of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any proceeding asserted against the indemnified party in connection with such person’s servings as a director officer employee or other fiduciary of fairchild or its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the acquisition b maintain in effect all provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries or any other agreements of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries with any indemnified party regarding elimination of liability indemnification of officers directors and employees and advancement of expenses in existence on the date of the fairchild agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition and c subject to certain qualifications provide to fairchild’s then current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition that is no less favorable than fairchild’s thenexisting policy or if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable the best available coverage 

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

see “legal proceedings” and note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for possible contingencies related to legal matters see also “business—government regulation” for information on certain environmental matters 

sources and uses of cash 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments research and development to make capital expenditures to repurchase our common stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand we also have the ability to utilize our revolving credit facility 

as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis see note 4 “acquisitions divestitures and licensing transactions” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

 

  

  

 our ability to service our longterm debt including our 1625 notes 100 notes revolving credit facility and term loan “b” facility to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next 12 months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

during the ordinary course of business we evaluate our cash requirements and if necessary adjust our expenditures for inventory operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand our capital expenditures are primarily directed toward production equipment and capacity expansion our capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives during 2017 we paid 3875 million for capital expenditures while in 2016 we paid 2107 million capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives our capital expenditures have historically been approximately 6 to 7 of annual revenues and we expect to continue to incur capital expenditures to support our business activities future capital expenditures may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted 

on november 30 2017 we certain of our domestic subsidiaries the “guarantors” the several lenders party thereto and the agent entered into the third amendment the third amendment provides for among other things modifications to the amended credit agreement to reduce the interest rate payable under the term loan “b” facility and to increase the amount that may be borrowed pursuant to the revolving credit facility to 10 billion in connection with the third amendment the company prepaid 4000 million of borrowings under the term loan “b” facility bringing the outstanding borrowings under the term loan “b” facility to approximately 12 billion as of the date of the third amendment we had 400 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of the date of the third amendment 

on march 31 2017 we and the guarantors entered into the second amendment the “second amendment” to the amended credit agreement the second amendment provides for among other things modifications to the 

 

amended credit agreement to allow the notes to rank pari passu with borrowings under the amended credit agreement and to reduce the interest rates payable under the term loan “b” facility and the revolving credit facility 

on march 31 2017 we completed the private unregistered offering of 5750 million aggregate principal amount of the 1625 notes which amount includes the full exercise of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase additional 1625 notes the net proceeds from the offering of the 1625 notes were used to repay 5621 million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan “b” facility 

on april 15 2016 we entered into two new financing arrangements to secure funds for the purchase consideration of fairchild among certain other items including a 22 billion term loan “b” facility with the proceeds deposited into escrow accounts and used to finance the transaction which occurred on september 19 2016 on september 30 2016 we amended the financing arrangements and increased the term loan “b” facility by 2000 million the associated interest expense related to our term loan “b” facility has had and will continue to have a material impact on our results of operations throughout the term of the amended credit agreement 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we issued 6900 million of our 100 notes and used a portion of the proceeds to pay down amounts previously drawn on our senior revolving credit facility we also increased the borrowing capacity of our senior revolving credit facility from 8000 million to 10 billion and reset the fiveyear maturity see note 8 “longterm debt” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

cash management 

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

primary cash flow sources 

our longterm cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash our cash flows from operating activities were 10942 million 5812 million and 4706 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

our cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2017 which includes a full year of fairchild increased by approximately 5130 million or approximately 883 compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily attributable to better results of operations our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on among other factors our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets 

our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below 

 

working capital 

working capital calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs in addition our working capital may be affected by acquisitions and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 5751 million as of december 31 2017 and has fluctuated between 3381 million and 6682 million at the end of each of our last six fiscal quarters our working capital including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 15243 million as of december 31 2017 and has fluctuated between 13045 million and 15243 million at the end of each of our last six fiscal quarters 

although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives for the year ended december 31 2017 our working capital was most significantly impacted by our capital expenditures and our repayment of longterm debt including capital leases see note 8 “longterm debt” and note 9 “earnings per share and equity” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

longterm assets and liabilities 

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets deferred taxes and goodwill 

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt and deferred taxes consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans generally our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions for additional information see note 11 “employee benefit plans” and note 15 “income taxes” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

on september 30 2016 the company entered into the first amendment to the amended credit agreement the first amendment reduced the applicable margins on eurocurrency loans to 275 and 325 for borrowings 

 

under the revolving credit facility and the term loan “b” facility respectively and reduced applicable margins on abr loans to 175 and 225 for borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan “b” facility respectively additionally the first amendment included the following i the term loan “b” facility was increased to 24 billion ii certain restructuring transactions and intercompany intellectual property transfers are permitted in order to achieve efficient integration of the company its subsidiaries and acquired entities and iii certain changes were made to the provisions regarding hedge agreements to allow the company and each of the guarantors to enter into certain hedge arrangements the company used the additional 2000 million proceeds under the term loan “b” facility to pay off the company’s 2000 million outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility 

share repurchase program 

we did not repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase program during the year ended december 31 2016 as we focused on the funding required for the fairchild transaction 

2015 financing events 

issuance of 100 notes 

during the second quarter of 2015 we completed a private unregistered offering for an aggregate principal amount of 6900 million of our 100 notes the 100 notes mature on december 1 2020 unless earlier purchased or converted we concurrently entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with certain institutional counterparties a portion of the proceeds from the offering were used to finance the hedge and warrant transactions associated with the issuance of the 100 notes to pay down the senior revolving credit facility and to repurchase 700 million of our common stock the issuance was a private placement made pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act 

amended senior revolving credit facility 

during the second quarter of 2015 we amended our 8000 million senior revolving credit facility to among other things increase the borrowing capacity to 10 billion and reset the five year maturity we also amended the terms of the related amended and restated credit agreement the facility includes 150 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit 150 million of availability for swingline loans for shortterm borrowings and a foreign currency sublimit of 750 million the facility may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital stock repurchase andor acquisitions 

share repurchase program 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we purchased approximately 304 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 3478 million exclusive of fees commissions and other expenses at a weightedaverage execution price of 1146 per share see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information 

debt guarantees and related covenants 

as of december 31 2017 we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our 100 notes and 1625 notes and with covenants relating to our term loan “b” facility revolving credit facility and our other debt 

 

agreements our 100 notes are senior to the existing and future subordinated indebtedness of on semiconductor and its guarantor subsidiaries our 1625 notes rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt and are subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt see note 8 “longterm debt” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience current and expected future conditions thirdparty evaluations and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following i estimates of future payouts for customer incentives and estimates of amounts subject to allowances returns and warranties ii measurement of valuation allowances relating to inventories and trade receivables iii future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets if applicable iv assumptions surrounding future pension obligations v fair values of sharebased compensation and of financial instruments including derivative financial instruments vi measurement of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets evaluations of uncertain tax positions and the impact of the us tax reform and vii estimates and assumptions used in connection with business combinations actual results may differ from these estimates 

revenue  we generate revenues from sales of our semiconductor products to oems electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue to a much lesser extent from manufacturing and design services provided to customers revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss pass to the customer generally upon shipment the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues are recorded net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances 

prior to the first quarter of 2017 for products sold to distributors who are entitled to ship and credit rights we recognized the related revenues and cost of revenues when we were informed by the distributor that it had resold the products to the enduser this was due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effects of the returns and allowances with these distributors for sales originating through the on semiconductor systems and processes legacy systems and processes of fairchild enable us to estimate up front the effects of returns and allowances provided to these distributors and thereby record the net revenues at the time of sale related to a legacy fairchild system and process we acquired fairchild on september 19 2016 

when we adopt asu 201409 asu 201514 asu 201608 asu 201610 asu 201612 and asu 201620 see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements” one of the more significant impacts would be that we would not be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer but rather would be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to certain distributors and record revenue at the time of 

 

sale to the distributor in anticipation of the adoption of the new standards we had developed our internal systems processes and controls for making the required estimates on the sales to these distributors as a result of these process changes during the first quarter of 2017 we were able to reliably estimate upfront the effects of returns and allowances and record revenues at the time of sales to these distributors as a result of this change we recognized 1551 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2017 the impact of this change resulted in an increase of 590 million to income before income taxes or 009 per basic and diluted share for the year ended december 31 2017 additionally we recorded accruals for the estimated returns from the distributors which decreased revenues by 81 million and income before income taxes by 53 million for the year ended december 31 2017 

although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience our oem customers do not have the right to return products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized and are netted against revenues we review warranty and related claims activities and records provisions as necessary 

freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense when incurred taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including valueadded and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or net realizable value and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected enduser demand these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory that is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

impairment of longlived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding iprd whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount impairment losses if applicable are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our asset groups that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value with related gains recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

 

iprd we are required to test our iprd assets for impairment annually using the guidance for indefinitelived intangible assets an iprd asset is considered to be impaired when the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its fair value our impairment evaluation consists of first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the iprd asset is impaired if it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired we calculate the fair value of the iprd asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount exceeds fair value we determine the fair value based on an income approach which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the iprd asset the assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenues gross profits operating expenses and industry trends we can bypass the qualitative assessment for any asset in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 

goodwill  we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable our divisions which are components of our operating segments constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill our divisions are one level below the operating segments constituting individual businesses at which level our segment management conducts regular reviews of the operating results our impairment evaluation of goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount if this qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no further analysis is required and goodwill is not impaired otherwise we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test to determine if goodwill is impaired the quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 

if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets associated with that unit goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value of the net assets associated with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is considered impaired and will be determined as the amount by which the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows discount and longterm growth rates we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows the assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenues gross profits operating expenses and industry trends we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and longterm growth rates to use in its analysis we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value changes in these estimates based on evolving economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates 

our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of 2018 however identification of a triggering event may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods 

defined benefit pension plans and related benefits  we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our nonus employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs and pension obligations are determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates for plan obligations assumed rates of return on pension plan assets and assumed rates of compensation increase for employees participating in the plans these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment and 

 

consultation with actuaries considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans as of december 31 2017 a 20 basis point change in the discount rates utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expenses would have impacted our results by approximately 83 million 

contingencies  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 

income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under this method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

in determining the amount of the valuation allowance estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies for each taxing jurisdiction are considered if we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made which could have a material impact to our effective tax rate see note 15 “income taxes” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information see also “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  income tax provision benefit” for additional information

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

as of december 31 2017 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 31750 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 20535 million excluding the smbc note of 1227 million which was paid on january 2 2018 we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 9988 million balance of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2017 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately 50 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase we entered into interest rate swaps to hedge some of the risk of variability in cash flows resulting from future interest payments on our variable interest rate debt under the term loan “b” facility 

to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures from an accounting and economic perspective however given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged we cannot provide any assurances that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the united states dollar as a normal part of the reporting process our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a nonfunctional currency changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged the notional amount of foreign currency contracts at december 31 2017 and 2016 was 1305 million and 959 million respectively our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies including japanese yen euros korean won malaysian ringgit philippines peso singapore dollars swiss francs chinese renminbi and czech koruna due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the us dollar for example we determined that based on a hypothetical weightedaverage change of 10 in currency exchange rates our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately 1012 million for the year ended december 31 2017 assuming no offsetting hedge positions 

see note 14 “financial instruments” in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further information with respect to our hedging activity

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the exchange act based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

we also carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2017 

on september 19 2016 we acquired fairchild which operated under its own set of systems and internal controls fairchild’s systems and control environment have been integrated into the company’s systems and control environment as of october 30 2017 

other than as described above there have been no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2017 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control  integrated framework 2013  based on this assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2017 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in “exhibits and financial statement schedules” of this form 10k

in general we have maintained longterm relationships with our key customers sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but typically do not require minimum purchase commitments most of our oem customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year while our other customers including electronic manufacturer service providers and distributors generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of endmarkets including computing automotive consumer industrial communications networking aerospacedefense and medical for the years ended december 31 2016 december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 we had no sales to individual customers including distributors that accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues 

for the year ended december 31 2016 aggregate revenue from our five largest customers per segment including distributors for our power solutions group analog solutions group and image sensor group comprised approximately 40 31  and 51 respectively of our total consolidated revenue the loss of certain of these customers or distributors may have a material adverse effect on the operations of the respective segment 

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period of two years generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days prior to shipment for custom products without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog and inventory” below 

 

endmarkets for our products 

the following table sets forth our principal endmarkets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each endmarket during 2016 sample applications for our products and representative oem customers and endusers 

 

  

oems direct sales to oems accounted for approximately 38 of our revenues in 2016 39 of our revenues in 2015 and 42 of our revenues in 2014 oem customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as bosch gmbh continental automotive systems delphi hella huawei technologies co ltd magna international panasonic corporation and samsung electronics we focus on three types of oems multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core oem customers the target market customers for our endmarkets are oems that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our oem customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our standard warranty 

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 56 of our revenues in 2016 54 of our revenues in 2015 and 50 of our revenues in 2014 our distributors which include arrow avnet macnica os electronics world peace and wt microelectronics resell to midsized and smaller oems and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to certain distributors are made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with certain of our distributors contain stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns due to current limitations on the feasibility of estimating the upfront effect of returns and allowances with these distributors we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to these distributors until these distributors resell the product as a result sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 6 of our revenues in 2016 7 of our revenues in 2015 and 8 of our revenues in 2014 among our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are benchmark electronic flextronics jabil and sanmina  these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for oems originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many oems now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace generally our electronic manufacturing service customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our standard warranty

manufacturing operations 

we operate frontend wafer fabrication facilities in belgium czech republic japan korea malaysia and the united states and backend assembly and test site facilities in canada china japan malaysia philippines vietnam and the united states in addition to these frontend and backend manufacturing operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 

 

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture with leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited a joint venture company in which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests “leshan” as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities along with the approximate gross square footage of each site’s building which includes among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

 

  

1 these facilities are leased 

2 this facility is used for both frontend and backend operations with a total square footage of 275642 consists of one leased and one owned building 

3 these facilities are located on leased land 

we operate all of our manufacturing facilities directly with the exception of our assembly and test operations facility located in leshan china which is owned by leshan our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is formerly a stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 80 of leshan’s production capacity in each of 2016 and 2015 and 70 in 2014 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 80 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2017 

 

we use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including amkor ase kingpak smic tpsco and umc collectively accounted for approximately 36 39 and 30 of our manufacturing costs in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and significant downturns or upturns in customer demand can materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and as a result is subject to significant downturns and upturns in customer demand for semiconductors and related products we cannot accurately predict the timing of future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these conditions might be significant downturns often occur in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used or declines in general economic conditions and can result in reduced product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results as a result of increased operating expenses outpacing decreased revenue reduced margins underutilization of our manufacturing capacity andor asset impairment charges on the other hand significant upturns can cause us to be unable to satisfy demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in the event of such an upturn we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

we may fail to realize the benefits expected from the fairchild transaction which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

although we expect significant benefits to result from the fairchild transaction there can be no assurance that we will actually realize these or any other anticipated benefits of the fairchild transaction and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by our ability to achieve such benefits achieving the benefits of the fairchild transaction depends in part on our ability to integrate fairchild’s business successfully and efficiently with our business 

the challenges involved in this integration which are complex and time consuming include the following 1 demonstrating to our and fairchild’s customers that the fairchild transaction will not adversely affect our ability to address the needs of customers 2 coordinating and integrating research and development and engineering teams across technologies and product platforms to enhance product development while reducing costs 3 consolidating and integrating corporate information technology finance and administrative infrastructures 4 coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities and the direction of product development and 5 minimizing the diversion of management attention from other important business objectives 

if we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating fairchild then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the fairchild transaction which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

rapid innovation and short product life cycles in the semiconductor industry can result in price erosion of older products which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid innovation and short product life cycles which often results in price erosion especially with respect to products containing outdated technology products are frequently replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes and as demand for older technology falls the price at which such products can be sold drops in some cases precipitously in addition our and our competitors’ excess inventory levels can accelerate general price erosion 

in order to continue to profitably supply older products we must offset lower prices by reducing production costs typically through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies if we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our production efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of older products moreover we may not be able to cease production of older products either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products for a sustained period of time if reductions in our production costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

downturns or volatility in general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in recent years worldwide semiconductor industry sales have tracked the impact of the financial crisis subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty we believe that the state of economic conditions in the united states is particularly uncertain due to likely shifts in legislative and regulatory conditions concerning among other matters international trade and taxation and that an uneven recovery or a renewed global downturn may put pressure on our sales due to reductions in customer demand as well as customers deferring purchases volatile andor uncertain economic conditions can adversely impact sales and profitability and make it difficult 

 

for us and our competitors to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected we may face oversupply of our products relative to customer demand in the past reduced customer spending has driven us and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which results in a negative effect on gross profit moreover volatility in revenues as a result of unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our shortterm and longterm strategies to the extent that our sales profitability and strategies are negatively affected by downturns or volatility in general economic conditions our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

if we do not have access to capital on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we require a substantial amount of capital to meet our operating requirements and remain competitive we routinely incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency to upgrade equipment and to expand production capacity and there can be no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended we have incurred and may continue to incur material amounts of debt to fund these requirements significant volatility or disruption in the global financial markets may result in us not being able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all and we may not be able to refinance if necessary any outstanding debt when due all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition any inability to obtain additional funding on favorable terms on the timeline we anticipate or at all may cause us to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or obtain funds through arrangements that management does not currently anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies the occurrence of any of which may significantly impair our ability to remain competitive if our operating results falter our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts often in markets or regions in which we have limited experience our decision to pursue an acquisition is based on among other factors our estimates of expected future earnings growth and potential cost savings for example we may anticipate tax savings through integration of a newly acquired business into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure and our estimates could turn out to be incorrect risks related to successful integration of an acquisition include but are not limited to 1 the ability to integrate information technology and other systems 2 unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence 3 customers responding by changing their existing business relationships with us or the acquired company 4 diversion of management’s attention from our day to day operations and 5 loss of key employees due to uncertainty about positions postintegration in addition we may incur unexpected costs such as operating or restructuring costs including severance payments to departing employees in the past we have recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions as a result of such factors as significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results missteps or delays in integrating our acquisitions which could 

 

be caused by factors outside of our control or our failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions on the timeline we anticipate or at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

depending on the level of our ownership interest in and the extent to which we can exercise control over the acquired business we may be required by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and sec rules and regulations to consolidate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or such statements may not be prepared in accordance with gaap or the acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems any of which could materially impair our ability to properly integrate such businesses into our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis any revisions to inaccuracies in or restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to accounting for our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to maintain manufacturing efficiency which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing requires advanced equipment and significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs which include depreciation expense manufacturing semiconductor components also involves highly complex processes that we and our competitors are continuously modifying to improve yields and product performance in addition impurities waste or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower production yields our manufacturing efficiency is and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or be successful in our manufacturing rationalization plans if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at expected levels or if production capacity increases while revenues do not the fixed costs and other operating expenses associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

many of our facilities and processes are interdependent and an operational disruption at any particular facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce many of our products which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we utilize an integrated manufacturing platform in which multiple facilities may each produce one or more components necessary for the assembly of a single product as a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities an operational disruption at a facility toward the frontend of our manufacturing process may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products for example our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers used by a number of our facilities and any operational disruption natural or manmade disaster or other extraordinary event that impacted the roznov facility would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce a number of our products worldwide in the event of a disruption at any such facility we may be unable to effectively source replacement components on acceptable terms from qualified third parties in which case our ability to produce many of our products could be materially disrupted or delayed conversely many of our facilities are single source facilities that only produce one of our endproducts and a disruption at any such facility would materially delay or cease production of the related product in the event of any such operational disruption we may experience difficulty in beginning production of replacement components or products at new facilities for example due to construction delays or transferring production to other existing facilities for example due to capacity 

 

constraints or difficulty in transitioning to new manufacturing processes any of which could result in a loss of future revenues and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the failure to successfully implement cost reduction initiatives including through restructuring activities could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

from time to time we have implemented cost reduction initiatives in response to significant downturns in our industry including relocating manufacturing to lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to lower costs implementing personnel reductions and voluntary retirement programs reducing employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs have been primarily composed of employee separation costs including severance payments and asset impairments we also often undertake restructuring activities and programs to improve our cost structure in connection with our business acquisitions which can result in significant charges including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges 

we cannot assure you that our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the associated cost reductions could materially adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position to the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other benefits of our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives that we anticipate our results of operations may be materially adversely effected 

if we are unable to identify and make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process and often requires significant capital investment and lead time for development and testing we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive in addition the lengthy development cycle for our products limits our ability to adapt quickly to changes affecting the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers there can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” for new products in addition design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or that we will generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments as expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured there is no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop new products that a significant investment in new products will be profitable or that we will have margins as high as we anticipate at the time of investment or have experienced historically to the extent that we underinvest in our research and development efforts or that our investments and capital expenditures in research and development do not lead to sales of new products we may be unable to bring to market technologies and products that are attractive to our customers and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

 

we may be unable to develop new products to satisfy or we may develop products that misalign with changing customer demands which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards together with frequent new product introductions our success is largely dependent on our ability to accurately predict identify and adapt to changes affecting the requirements of our customers in a timely and costeffective manner we focus our independent new product development efforts on market segments and applications that we anticipate will experience growth but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying highgrowth areas a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns and preferences in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could make our current products obsolete and could make new products that we planned to introduce no longer relevant to our customers’ needs if our new product development efforts fail to align with the needs of our customers including due to circumstances outside of our control like a fundamental shift in the product markets of our customers and end users our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

uncertainties regarding the timing and amount of customer orders could lead to excess inventory and writedowns of inventory that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers requiring a commitment to purchase generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days for custom products without incurring a significant penalty we routinely generate inventory based on customers’ estimates of enduser demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties which may vary significantly in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction of products due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers unsold inventory cancelled orders and cancellation penalties may materially adversely affect our results of operations and inventory writedowns may materially adversely affect our financial condition 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fully customized ics as well as from customers who develop their own ic products in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

our inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations products or technologies developed by competitors that are larger and have more substantial research and development budgets or that are smaller and more targeted in their development efforts may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive we also may be unable to market and sell our products if they are 

 

not competitive on the basis of price quality technical performance features system compatibility customized design innovation availability delivery timing and reliability if we fail to compete effectively on developing strategic relationships with customers and customer sales and technical support our sales and revenues may be materially adversely affected competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise prices and any inability to maintain revenues or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a significant adverse effect on our gross margin reduced sales and lower gross margins would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the semiconductor industry has experienced rapid consolidation and our inability to compete with large competitors or failure to identify attractive opportunities to consolidate may materially adversely affect our business 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by the high costs associated with developing marketable products and manufacturing technologies as well as high levels of investment in production capabilities as a result the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including but not limited to substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition in addition we may be at a competitive disadvantage to our peers if we fail to identify attractive opportunities to consolidate with larger or smaller companies to expand our business consolidation among our competitors and integration among our customers could erode our market share negatively impact our capacity to compete and require us to restructure our operations any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

natural disasters and other business disruptions could cause significant harm to our business operations and facilities and could adversely affect our supply chain and our customer base any of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition 

our us and international manufacturing facilities and distribution centers as well as the operations of our thirdparty suppliers are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods hurricanes earthquakes typhoons and similar natural disasters as well as power outages telecommunications failures industrial accidents and similar events the occurrence of natural disasters in any of the regions in which we operate could severely disrupt the operations of our businesses by negatively impacting our supply chain our ability to deliver products and the cost of our products such events can negatively impact revenues and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event in addition these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the us and worldwide economies although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms to the extent any losses from natural disasters or other business disruptions are not covered by insurance any costs writedowns impairments and decreased revenues can materially adversely affect our business our results of operations and our financial condition 

the loss of one of our largest customers or a significant reduction in the revenue we generate from these customers could materially adversely affect our revenues profitability and results of operations 

product sales to our ten largest customers have historically accounted for a significant amount of our business for instance for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 revenue from our 10 largest end customers 

 

collectively represented approximately 24 and 22 respectively of our total revenues for those years many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that our largest customers will not cease purchasing products from us in favor of products produced by other suppliers significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future and any such event could have a material adverse effect on our revenues profitability and results of operations 

because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the automotive and communications industries a downturn or lower sales to customers in either industry could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

a significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive and communications industries including networking sales into these industries represented approximately 34 and 19 of our revenue respectively for the year ended december 31 2016 and those percentages will vary from quarter to quarter both the automotive and communications industries are cyclical and as a result our customers in these industries are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions disruptive innovation and endmarket preferences which can adversely affect sales of our products and correspondingly our results of operations additionally the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in these industries could decline despite continued growth in their respective end markets lower sales to customers in the automotive or communications industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

shortages or increased prices of raw materials could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including various chemicals and gases polysilicon silicon wafers aluminum gold silver copper lead frames mold compound and ceramic packages generally our agreements with suppliers of raw materials impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers of raw materials may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors beyond our control shortages could occur in various essential raw materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner the costs of our raw materials increases significantly their quality deteriorates or they give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent on the services of thirdparty suppliers and contract manufacturers and any disruption in or deterioration of the quality of the services delivered by such third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we use thirdparty contractors for certain of our manufacturing activities primarily wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to commit to purchase services based on forecasted product needs which may be inaccurate and in some cases require longerterm commitments we are also dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized thirdparty suppliers for required components and materials for certain of our key technologies arranging for replacement manufacturers and suppliers can be time consuming and costly and the number of qualified alternative providers can be extremely limited our business operations productivity and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasted needs proved to be materially incorrect 

 

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant amount of our total revenue outside of the us is derived from the asiapacific region and europe and we maintain significant operations in these regions in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

 

               we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets the materialization of any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates or the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or have exposure to additional tax liabilities which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

changes to income tax regulations in the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could under our existing tax structure significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition other factors or events including business combinations and investment transactions changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns or as a result of deficiencies asserted by taxing authorities increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in available tax credits increasing operations in high tax jurisdictions and changes in tax rates could also increase our future effective tax rate 

 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these changes if adopted by countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the united states a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time 

the distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the united states may be subject to united states income taxes thus reducing our net income and materially adversely affecting our results of operations 

we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt repurchases and repayments acquisitions and stock repurchases if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current debt agreements or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations 

we operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies andor legal entity structures which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are therefore subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties there is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results or operations and cash flows 

our legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations changes in tax laws regulations future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in us becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

currency fluctuations changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sizeable sales and operations in the asiapacific region and europe and a significant amount of this business is transacted in currency other than us dollars in addition while a significant percentage of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside the us many of our liabilities including our outstanding indebtedness and certain other cash payments such as share repurchases are payable in us dollars as a result currency fluctuations and changes in foreign exchange regulations can have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

in addition repatriation of funds held outside the us could have adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay due to required local country approvals or local obligations from time to time we are required to make cash deposits outside of the us to support bank guarantees of our obligations under certain office leases or amounts we owe to certain vendors and such cash deposits are not available for other uses as long as the related bank guarantees are outstanding foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency as a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the us our financial flexibility may be reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations restrictions on repatriation or the inability to use cash held abroad to fund our operations in the us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

we may be unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 

our success depends on our ability to attract motivate and retain highly skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel both in the us and internationally in the semiconductor industry the competition for qualified personnel particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees is intense particularly when the business cycle is improving during such periods competitors may try to recruit our most valuable technical employees while we devote a great deal of our attention to designing competitive compensation programs aimed at accomplishing this goal specific elements of our compensation programs may not be competitive with those of our competitors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and on our business 

if we must reduce our use of equity awards to compensate our employees our competitiveness in the employee marketplace could be adversely affected and our results of operations could vary as a result of changes in our stockbased compensation programs 

we have in the past and expect to continue to issue rsus with timebased vesting performancebased awards and common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time as compensation tools while this is a routine practice in many parts of the world foreign exchange and income tax regulations in some countries make this practice more and more difficult such regulations tend to diminish the value of equity compensation to our employees in those countries our current practice is to seek stockholder approval of new or amendments to existing equity compensation plans if these proposals do not receive stockholder approval we may not be able to grant equity awards to employees at the same levels as in the past which could materially adversely affect our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel thereby materially adversely affecting our business in addition changes in forecasted stockbased compensation expense could cause our results of operations to vary by impacting our gross margin percentage research and development expenses marketing general and administrative expenses and our tax rate 

 

disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could materially harm our business and reputation 

currently certain of our us employees in pennsylvania are represented by labor unions in addition we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our nonunion facilities disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to production slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers which could result in a loss of business and material damage to our reputation in addition union activity and compliance with international labor standards could result in higher labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the enforceability of our patents trademarks copyrights software licenses and other ip is uncertain in certain circumstances effective ip protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the us and internationally the various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered ip assets patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts with respect to our ip generally we cannot assure you that 

 

    when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights of its own against us which may materially adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business results of operations or cash flows 

in addition some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications we seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to ip arising out of our research should we be unable to protect our ip competitors may develop products or technologies that duplicate our products or technologies benefit financially from innovations for which we bore the costs of development and undercut the sales and marketing of our products all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

if our technologies are subject to claims of infringement on the ip rights of third parties efforts to address such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may from time to time be subject to claims that we may be infringing thirdparty ip rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such ip rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for ip we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring such technologies further we may be subject to ip litigation which could cause us to incur significant expense materially adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

 

      the outcome of ip litigation is inherently uncertain and if not resolved in our favor could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

environmental and health and safety liabilities and expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground and we have been identified as either a primary responsible party or a potentially responsible party at sites where we or our predecessors operated or disposed of waste in the past our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other requirements regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances we have indemnities from third parties for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities for periods prior to our operations at some of our current and past sites and we have also purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance will cover any or all of our material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities including 

 

      

to the extent that we face unforeseen environmental or health and safety compliance costs or remediation expenses or liabilities that are not covered by indemnities or insurance we may bear the full effect of such costs expense and liabilities which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards 

like most publicly traded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm as we continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future 

there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future failure to comply with sox including delaying or failing to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such transactions and the trading price of our common stock or other securities may decline in addition if we fail to remedy any material weakness our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements our financial statements may be materially inaccurate our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process requiring production in a tightly controlled clean environment minute impurities in our manufacturing materials contaminants in the manufacturing environment manufacturing equipment failures and other defects can cause our products to be noncompliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in electrical design oems are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage if any and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall could have material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved in certain instances we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective and to the extent that we are liable for damages in excess of the revenues and profits we received from the products involved our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could irreparably damage our reputation and our business expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

we routinely collect and store sensitive data including ip and other proprietary information about our business and that of our customers suppliers and business partners the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses illegal hacking criminal fraud or impersonation acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error our security measures andor those of our third party service providers andor customers may not detect or prevent such security breaches the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber security breaches and vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may materially impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business an interruption in our operations the unauthorized transfer of cash or other of our assets the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws in addition to the extent we sell products containing bugs or viruses to our customers we may be exposed to liability from the endusers of such products any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

sales through distributors and other third parties expose us to risks that if realized could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we face risks related to our sale of a significant and increasing portion of our products through distributors distributors may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the fcpa or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial debt could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2016 we had 38068 million of outstanding indebtedness we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future to repay or refinance other outstanding debt to make acquisitions or for other purposes and if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

 

  

          to the extent that we continue to maintain or expand our significant indebtedness our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

indebtedness incurred in connection with the fairchild transaction could materially and adversely affect us by among other things limiting our ability to conduct our operations and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

in connection with our acquisition of fairchild we entered into the amended credit agreement providing for the 600 million revolving credit facility which provides liquidity to us and the 24 billion term loan “b” facility which was used to fund the acquisition of fairchild the obligations under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the personal property and material real property assets of the company and most of the company’s domestic subsidiaries as a result if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the amended credit agreement the lenders could take possession of and foreclose on the pledged collateral securing the indebtedness in which case we would be at risk of losing the related collateral which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations in addition subject to customary exceptions the amended credit agreement requires mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances which may result in prepaying outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility and the term loan “b” facility rather than using funds for other business purposes our acquisitionrelated financing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition including among other things our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and could reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 

 

the agreements relating to our indebtedness including the amended credit agreement may restrict our ability to operate our business and as a result may materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our debt agreements including the amended credit agreement contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to 

 

          such agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them to the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations our financial condition may be materially adversely affected these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us to the extent that we are unable to engage in activities that support the growth profitability and competitiveness of our business our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations and any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations as they come due we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect furthermore we cannot assure you that if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness which could materially negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition a default under our committed credit facilities including our amended credit agreement could also limit our ability to make further borrowings under those facilities which could materially adversely affect our business and results and operations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to the current stockholders 

 

an event of default under any agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness could cross default other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness any such cross default would put immediate pressure on our liquidity and financial condition and would amplify the risks described above with regards to being unable to repay our indebtedness when due and payable we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our operating subsidiaries which may have no independent obligation to repay our debt are not able to make cash available to us for such repayment our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and as described above any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if interest rates increase our debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could increase significantly which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

borrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time including under our amended credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and as a result expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease during the first quarter of 2017 we entered into interest rate swaps that involved the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility for a portion of our term loan “b” facility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk to the extent the risk materializes and is not fully mitigated the resulting increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

servicing the 100 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 100 notes in a timely manner 

in june 2015 we issued 6900 million aggregate principal amount of our 100 notes holders of the 100 notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined under the indenture governing the 100 notes at a repurchase price equal to 

 

100 of the principal amount of the 100 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change repurchase date in addition upon conversion of the 100 notes to be repurchased unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 100 notes being converted moreover we will be required to repay the 100 notes in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted or repurchased servicing the 100 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 100 notes our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 100 notes repurchase the 100 notes in the event of a fundamental change or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the 100 notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would dilute existing stockholders in addition if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the 100 notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of the 100 notes which could cross default other debt and materially adversely harm our business the terms of the amended credit agreement limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur but the terms of the 100 notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above our decision to use our cash for other purposes such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock could also intensify these risks 

the conditional conversion feature of the 100 notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and if we elect to settle the 100 notes conversion in common stock could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding september 1 2020 holders of the 100 notes may convert the 100 notes only if specified conditions are met in the event the conditional conversion feature of the 100 notes is triggered holders of the 100 notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option if one or more holders elect to convert their 100 notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash which could materially adversely affect our liquidity in addition if the conditional conversion feature of the 100 notes is triggered even if holders do not elect to convert their 100 notes we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 100 notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital any material decrease in our liquidity or reduction in our net working capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we elect to settle the 100 notes conversion in common stock such issuance of common stock could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders including stockholders who previously converted their 100 notes 

the fundamental change repurchase feature of our 100 notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company 

the terms of our 100 notes require us to repurchase the 100 notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined under the indenture governing the 100 notes in certain circumstances a takeover of our company could trigger an option of the holders of the 100 notes to require us to repurchase the 100 notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors in the 100 notes which could materially decrease the value of the 100 notes 

 

note hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

concurrently with the issuance of the 100 notes we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions which we refer to as the option counterparties the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the 100 notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 100 notes as the case may be we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds 2596 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock andor entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock following the pricing of the 100 notes the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 100 notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 100 notes or following any repurchase of the 100 notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions if realized could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we are subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral if one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions 

to the extent the option counterparties do not honor their contractual commitments with us pursuant to the note hedge transactions we could face a material increase in our exposure to potential dilution upon any conversion of the 100 notes andor cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 100 notes as the case may be our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock in addition upon a default by one of the option counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences with respect to our common stock any such adverse tax consequences or increased cash payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may impact the value of our common stock a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small 

 

declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter in addition to the other factors described above factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

 

              an adverse change or development in any of the above factors could cause the market price of common stock to materially decline 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors 

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors among others some of which are beyond our control 

 

       the trading price of our common stock in the past has had significant variance and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

 

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

 

   although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders any delay or prevention of an acquisition of our company that would have been beneficial to our stockholders could materially decrease the value of our common stock

executive overview 

this executive overview presents summarized information regarding our industry markets business and operating trends only for further information relating to the information summarized herein see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in its entirety 

 

industry overview 

in recent years worldwide semiconductor industry sales have tracked the impact of the financial crisis subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty according to wsts an industry research firm worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 3389 billion in 2016 an increase of approximately 11 from 3352 billion in 2015 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our serviceable addressable market “sam” since 2012 

 

  

  

 as indicated above worldwide semiconductor sales increased from 2916 billion in 2012 to 3389 billion in 2016 the increase of 11 from 2015 to 2016 reflected improving macroeconomic conditions in the second half of 2016 sales in our sam increased from 1037 billion in 2012 to 1189 billion in 2016 the increase of 26 from 2015 to 2016 is consistent with the trend in the worldwide semiconductor market the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our sam of approximately 40 for the next three years these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have 

 

reduced or shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have caused demand to strengthen production volumes have historically stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand reaches levels above capacity production capabilities shortages begin to occur which typically causes pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle

we believe that some of the key factors and trends affecting our results of operations include but not limited to 

 

         

 fairchild acquisition 

on september 19 2016 we completed our acquisition of fairchild pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger the “fairchild agreement” with each of fairchild and falcon operations sub inc a delaware corporation and our whollyowned subsidiary which provided for the acquisition of fairchild by us the “fairchild transaction” the purchase price totaled 25322 million and was funded by the borrowings against our term loan “b” facility and a partial draw of our revolving credit facility and with cash on hand 

we believe that this acquisition creates a power semiconductor leader with strong capabilities in a rapidly consolidating semiconductor industry ultimately we believe that the combination of fairchild operations with our own will provide complementary product lines to offer customers the full spectrum of high medium and low voltage products and we will continue to pioneer technology and design innovation in efficient energy consumption to help our customers achieve success and drive value for our partners and employees around the world we believe the acquisition also expands our footprint in wireless communication products particularly in high efficiency power conversions and usb type c communication and power delivery see “business  2016 acquisition activity” “risk factors” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional information see note 4 “acquisitions and divestitures” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

recent on semiconductor results 

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 were 39069 million an increase of approximately 118 from 34958 million from the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was attributable to the acquisition of fairchild  partially offset by lower revenues in our image sensor group during 2016 we reported net income attributable to on semiconductor of 1821 million compared to 2062 million in 2015 our gross margin decreased by approximately 90 basis points to 332 in 2016 from 341 in 2015 the decrease was due to the expensing of the fair market value of inventory stepup from the fairchild acquisition of 675 million excluding the expensing of the fair market value of inventory stepup the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by higher factory utilization and product mix 

on semiconductor q1 2017 outlook 

based upon product booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we estimate that our revenues will be approximately 1215 to 1265 million in the first quarter of 2017 backlog levels for the first quarter of 2017 represent approximately 80 to 85 of our anticipated first quarter 2017 revenues for the first quarter of 2017 we estimate that gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be approximately 334 to 348 

statements related to our outlook for the first quarter of 2017 are based on our current expectations forecasts estimates and assumptions such statements involve risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forwardlooking statements see “risk factors” for additional information 

business and macroeconomic environment influence on cost savings and restructuring activities 

in 2016 and 2017 our initiatives have been and will be focused on synergy related cost reductions from the fairchild acquisition additionally we have historically pursued and expect to continue to pursue other cost 

 

saving initiatives to align our overall cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our expected revenue spending and capacity levels based on our current sales and manufacturing projections we have recognized efficiencies from previously implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure however the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions there can be no assurances that we will adequately forecast economic conditions or that we will effectively align our cost structure capital investments and other expenditures with our revenue spending and capacity levels in the future 

see “results of operations  restructuring asset impairments and other net” below along with note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information relating to our most recent cost saving initiatives 

segment realignment in 2016 

during the third quarter of 2016 we realigned our operating and reporting segments into the following three operating and reporting segments to optimize anticipated efficiencies resulting from our acquisition of fairchild power solutions group analog solutions group and image sensor group the operating results of the system solutions group which was previously our fourth operating and reporting segment and which did not have goodwill are now assigned among the three current operating and reporting segments prior year periods of segment information presented below reflect the current three operating and reporting segments our power solutions group and analog solutions group operating and reporting segments include the business acquired in the fairchild transaction 

results of operations 

our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2016 include the results of operations from our acquisitions of fairchild axsem aptina and truesense on september 19 2016 july 15 2015 august 15 2014 and april 30 2014 respectively 

 

operating results 

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 in millions 

 

 revenues 

revenues were 39069 million 34958 million and 31618 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase of 4111 million or approximately 12 in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to approximately 212 and 107 increases in revenue in our power solutions group and analog solutions group respectively which included fairchild revenues of 4115 million between september 19 2016 and december 31 2016 this increase was partially offset by lower revenues in our image sensor group 

 

the increase in revenues from 2015 compared to 2014 of 3340 million or approximately 11 was primarily attributed to 4110 million of additional revenue in the image sensor group provided by a full year of operations from the 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense partially offset by decreased revenue from our former system solutions group segment and a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 8 

revenues by reportable segment for each of 2016 2015 and 2014 were as follows dollars in millions

the 2016 increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of fairchild which had 2775 million in revenues across various products within this segment revenues from our discrete products increased by 2150 million or approximately 35 revenues from our new ipms and optoelectronics products increased by 458 million and 208 million respectively and revenues from our analog products increased by 205 million or approximately 6 

the 2015 decrease resulted from a decrease in revenues from our ipm products of 141 million or approximately 13 and a decrease in revenues from tmos products of 146 million or approximately 6 partially offset by an increase in revenues from memory products of 167 million or approximately 24 

revenues from the analog solutions group 

revenues from the analog solutions group increased by 1429 million or approximately 11 during 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased by 772 million or approximately 5 during 2015 compared to 2014 

the 2016 increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of fairchild which had 1340 million in revenues across various products within this segment additionally revenues from our legacy analog products increased 199 million or approximately 5 partially offset by decreased revenue in our lsi products of 150 million or approximately 5 

the 2015 decrease resulted from a decrease in revenues from our lsi products of 620 million or approximately 18 and a decrease in revenues from analog products of 185 million or approximately 5 

revenues from the image sensor group 

revenues from the image sensor group decreased by 305 million or approximately 4 during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased by 4248 million or approximately 132 during 2015 compared to 2014 

 

the 2016 decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues from our consumer products of 576 million or approximately 9 offset by an increase in revenues from our lsi products of 152 million or approximately 51 and an increase in revenues from our asic products of 118 million or approximately 12 

the 2015 increase was primarily attributable to 4096 million of additional revenue generated by aptina and truesense during their first full year of operations after acquisition as compared to 2014 in which the two businesses generated 2624 million of revenue during the period of 2014 after the closing of the acquisitions

gross profit and gross margin exclusive of amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets described below 

our gross profit by reportable segment for each of 2016 2015 and 2014 was as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

1 unallocated manufacturing costs are being shown as a percentage of total revenue includes expensing of the fair market value stepup of inventory of 675 million during 2016 

2 certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts 

 

our gross profit was 12969 million 11932 million and 10849 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the gross profit increase of 1037 million or approximately 9 for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the contributions from fairchild which generated approximately 87 million of gross profit for 2016 

the gross profit increase of 1083 million or approximately 10 for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the contributions of acquisitions during 2014 including 270 million for the amortization of the fair market value of inventory stepup from our acquisitions during 2014 for which there was no amortization during 2015 and manufacturing and cost improvements that were partially offset by decreased average selling prices 

gross margin decreased to approximately 332 during 2016 compared to approximately 341 during 2015 excluding the expensing of the fair market value of inventory stepup from the fairchild acquisition of 675 million gross margin increased primarily due to higher factory utilization and product mix 

gross margin decreased to approximately 341 during 2015 compared to approximately 343 during 2014 this decrease was primarily driven by a larger proportion of our revenues provided by our image sensor group which generates lower gross margin levels than our analog solutions group and power solutions group 

operating expenses 

research and development 

research and development expenses were 4523 million 3967 million and 3666 million representing approximately 12 11 and 12 of revenues for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the increase in research and development expenses of 556 million or approximately 14 during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily associated with the acquisition of fairchild which added to several categories of research and development expenses totaling 288 million research and development expenses unrelated to the fairchild transaction increased by 268 million primarily in the area of payroll including incentive compensation and payroll related costs pension losses and ip related activities 

the increase in research and development expenses of 301 million or approximately 8 during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily associated with an increase of 504 million from expenses attributable to the operations of aptina and truesense for the full period in 2015 these expenses were partially offset by lower payroll costs including incentive compensation and payroll related costs in our analog solutions group and former system solutions group segment 

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expenses were 2380 million 2043 million and 2000 million representing approximately 6 of revenues in each year period for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the increase in selling and marketing expenses of 337 million or approximately 16 during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily associated with the acquisition of fairchild which had selling and marketing expenses of 267 million primarily in the area of payroll including incentive compensation and payroll related costs there were also increases in expenses related to outside services and travel 

 

the increase in selling and marketing expenses of 43 million or approximately 2 during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily associated with an increase of 235 million for expenses attributable to the operations of aptina and truesense for the full period in 2015 these expenses were significantly offset by lower payroll costs including incentive compensation and payroll related costs in our analog solutions group power solutions group and former system solutions group segment 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses were 2303 million 1823 million and 1809 million representing approximately 6 5 and 6 of revenues for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the increase in general and administrative expenses of 480 million or approximately 26 during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily associated with the acquisition of fairchild which had general and administrative expenses of 369 million primarily in the area of payroll including incentive compensation and payroll related costs outside services travel related expenses as well as acquisition related expenses 

the increase in general and administrative expenses of 14 million or approximately 1 during 2015 compared to 2014 includes an increase of approximately 146 million for expenses attributable to the operations of aptina and truesense for the full period in 2015 partially offset by lower payroll including incentive compensation and payroll related costs in our power solutions group analog solutions group and former system solutions group 

amortization of acquisition—related intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 1048 million 1357 million and 684 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease of 309 million during 2016 compared to 2015 was attributable to the declining amortization of our aptina and truesense intangible assets partially offset by the amortization of our intangible assets acquired from the fairchild acquisition amortization of acquired intangible assets from the fairchild transaction was 126 million between september 19 2016 and december 31 2016 

the increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets during 2015 compared to 2014 was attributable to a full period of the amortization of intangible assets assumed as a result of our acquisitions of aptina and truesense 

see note 4 “acquisition and divestitures” and note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information with respect to intangible assets 

restructuring asset impairments and other net 

restructuring asset impairments and other net was 332 million 93 million and 305 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the information below summarizes the major activities in each year for additional information see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

during 2016 we recorded approximately 332 million of net charges related to our restructuring programs consisting primarily of 257 million of postfairchild acquisition restructuring costs 53 million of former 

 

system solutions group segment voluntary workforce reduction program costs and 21 million of manufacturing relocation program costs 

during 2015 we recorded approximately 93 million of net charges related to our restructuring programs consisting primarily of 35 million of employee separation charges from our european marketing organization relocation plan and 48 million of general workforce reductions total restructuring asset impairments and other net was partially offset by a 34 million gain from the sale of assets 

during the first quarter of 2015 we announced that we would relocate our european customer marketing organization from france to slovakia and germany as a result six positions are expected to be eliminated we recorded 35 million of related employee separation charges during 2015 the impacted employees left the company during the second half of 2016 

during the third quarter of 2015 management approved and commenced implementation of restructuring actions primarily targeted workforce reductions we notified approximately 150 employees of their employment termination the majority of which had exited by the end of 2015 the total expense for 2015 was 48 million 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we initiated a voluntary retirement program for employees of certain of our former system solutions group segment subsidiaries in japan the “q4 2013 voluntary retirement program” approximately 350 employees opted to retire under the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program of which all employees had exited by the end of 2014 for 2014 we recognized approximately 104 million of employee separation charges related to the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program 

in connection with the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program approximately 70 contractor positions were also identified for elimination all of which all had exited by the end of 2015 during 2014 an additional 40 positions were identified for elimination as an extension of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program consisting of 20 employees and 20 contractors substantially all of whom had exited by the end of 2014 

as a result of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program we recognized a pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees of 45 million during 2014 which is recorded in restructuring asset impairments and other net see note 11 “employee benefit plans” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during 2014 we initiated further voluntary retirement activities applicable to an additional 60 to 70 positions for certain of our former system solutions group segment subsidiaries in japan consisting of employees and contractors substantially all personnel had exited under this program by december 31 2014 

on october 6 2013 we announced a plan to close kss the “kss plan” pursuant to the kss plan a majority of the production from kss was transferred to other of our manufacturing facilities the kss plan includes the elimination of approximately 170 full time and 40 contract employees during 2014 we recorded approximately 78 million of employee separation charges and 23 million of exit costs related to the kss plan 

 

as a result of the kss facility closure we recognized a 21 million pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees during 2014 which was recorded in restructuring asset impairments and other net see note 11 “employee benefit plans” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

indefinite and longlived asset impairment charges 

during 2016 we canceled certain of our previously capitalized iprd projects and recorded impairment losses of 22 million included in the “goodwill and intangible asset impairment” caption in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

during 2015 we canceled certain of our previously capitalized iprd projects and recorded impairment losses of 38 million included in the “goodwill and intangible asset impairment” caption in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

during 2014 we determined that approximately 87 million in carrying value of goodwill relating to one of our reporting units in the analog solutions group was impaired resulting from a decline in estimated future cash flows in connection with this impairment we wroteoff approximately 09 million of intangible assets and 47 million of other longlived assets 

see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

other income and expenses 

interest expense 

interest expense increased by 956 million to 1453 million during 2016 compared to 497 million in 2015 primarily due to the substantial indebtedness incurred in order to acquire fairchild interest expense increased by 156 million or approximately 46 to 497 million during 2015 up from 341 million in 2014 primarily due to additional amortization of debt discount on our 100 notes we expect interest expense to remain substantial in future periods as we service the debt we incurred in connection with the fairchild transaction we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of 260 million 175 million and 70 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively our average gross amount of longterm debt balance including current maturities during 2016 2015 and 2014 was 26613 million 13616 million and 10856 million respectively our weighted average interest rate on our gross amount of longterm debt including current maturities was approximately 55 37 and 31 per annum in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources  key financing and capital events” below and note 8 “longterm debt” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a description of the indebtedness incurred for the fairchild transaction and our refinancing activities 

 

gain on divestiture of business 

gain on divestiture of business was 922 million during 2016 on august 29 2016 the company sold two lines of business for 1040 million in cash in connection with the sale the company recorded a gain of 922 million after among other things transferring inventory of 41 million to littelfuse inc writing off goodwill of 34 million and deferring 43 million of the proceeds to be recognized in the future see note 4 “acquisitions and divestitures” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further information 

loss on modification or extinguishment of debt 

loss on modification or extinguishment of debt increased by 59 million from 04 million to 63 million from 2015 to 2016 due to the execution of the first amendment which resulted in a debt extinguishment charge of 47 million and the termination and replacement of our senior revolving credit facility by the revolving credit facility which resulted in a debt modification and writeoff of 16 million in unamortized debt issuance costs

during 2015 we amended our senior revolving credit facility to among other things increase the borrowing capacity to 10 billion and reset the facility’s five year maturity as a result of the amendment we wroteoff 04 million of existing debt issuance costs associated with the facility resulting in a loss during 2016 

other 

other income decreased by 83 million from income of 77 million in 2015 to an expense of 06 million in 2016 other income increased by 121 million from an expense of 44 million in 2014 to income of 77 million in 2015 the change from year to year is largely attributable to fluctuations in foreign currencies against the dollar for the period net of the impact from our hedging activity along with gains and losses on availableforsale securities 

income tax provision benefit 

we recorded an income tax benefit of 39 million an income tax provision of 108 million and an income tax benefit of 02 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the income tax benefit for 2016 consisted primarily of the reversal of 3598 million of our previously established valuation allowance against part of our us federal and foreign deferred tax assets and the release of 19 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2016 this is partially offset by 3108 million related to the reversal of the prior years’ indefinite reinvestment assertion 435 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations and 35 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions 

the income tax provision for 2015 consisted of the reversal of 121 million of our previously established valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets the release of 43 million for reserves and interest 

 

for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions that were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2015 and a change in tax rate that favorably impacted deferred balances by 16 million this is partially offset by 244 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations and 44 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions 

the income tax benefit for 2014 consisted of the reversal of 233 million of our previously established valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as a result of a net deferred tax liability recorded as part of the truesense acquisition and the reversal of 46 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions that were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2014 this is partially offset by 198 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations 46 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions and 33 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill 

our effective tax rate for 2016 was a benefit of 22 which differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the release of our us and japan valuation allowances partially offset by the reversal of the prior years’ indefinite reinvestment assertion our effective tax rate for 2015 was a provision of 49 which differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 primarily due to our change in valuation allowance deemed dividend income from foreign subsidiaries and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries our effective tax rate for 2014 was a benefit of 01 which differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate of 35 primarily due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries 

the consummation of the fairchild acquisition during the quarter ended september 30 2016 caused the company to reassess the prior years’ indefinite reinvestment assertion because of the us debt incurred to fund the acquisition see note 8 “longterm debt” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information this resulted in a change in judgment regarding the future cash flows by jurisdiction and the reversal of prior years’ indefinite reinvestment assertion the change in assertion which resulted in recording a deferred tax liability for future us taxes had a direct impact on the judgment about the realizability of the us federal deferred tax assets which resulted in a release of valuation allowance the change in the prior years’ indefinite reinvestment assertion resulted in an increase to income tax expense of 3108 million which was partially offset by a benefit of 2679 million relating to the release of valuation allowance the reversal of the prior year’s indefinite reinvestment assertion and release of the us federal valuation allowance did not have an effect on our cash taxes 

we have not made an indefinite reinvestment assertion related to current year foreign earnings we expect our future tax rate to more approximate the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effect of the increase in the future rate is not anticipated to have an effect on our cash tax until all of our us federal net operating losses and credits have been utilized 

we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on a portion of our foreign tax credits and foreign net operating losses a substantial portion of which relate to japan net operating losses which are projected to expire prior to utilization in addition we also maintain a valuation allowance on a portion of our us foreign tax credit carryforwards and a full valuation allowance on our us capital loss carryforwards and us state deferred tax assets

   the table also excludes our pension obligations we expect to make cash contributions to comply with local funding requirements and required benefit payments of approximately 121 million in 2017 this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2017 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations see note 11 “employee benefit plans” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information on our pension obligations 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 10281 million as of december 31 2016 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months total cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016 include approximately 3990 million available in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt service debt repayments and acquisitions while we hold a significant amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries we have the ability to obtain cash in the united states through distributions from our foreign 

 

subsidiaries in order to cover our domestic needs by utilizing existing credit facilities or through new bank loans or debt obligations

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

in the normal course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us as required for transactions including but not limited to material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases utilities and customs guarantees our senior revolving credit facility includes 150 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit there were no letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016 we had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our senior revolving credit facility of 67 million at december 31 2016 

as part of securing financing in the normal course of business we issued guarantees related to our capital lease obligations equipment financing lines of credit and real estate mortgages which totaled approximately 1307 million as of december 31 2016 we are also a guarantor of sci llc’s noncollateralized loan with smbc which had a balance of 1604 million as of december 31 2016 

based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements 

for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and incur similar expenses totaling 1489 million as payments come due we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases letters of credit and guarantee arrangements 

contingencies 

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to ip infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in economic damages bodily injury or property damage in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims 

 

we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

the fairchild agreement provides for indemnification and insurance rights in favor of fairchild’s then current and former directors officers and employees specifically the company has agreed that for no fewer than six years following the fairchild acquisition a it will indemnify and hold harmless each such indemnitee against losses and expenses including advancement of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any proceeding asserted against the indemnified party in connection with such person’s servings as a director officer employee or other fiduciary of fairchild or its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the acquisition b it will maintain in effect all provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries or any other agreements of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries with any indemnified party regarding elimination of liability indemnification of officers directors and employees and advancement of expenses in existence on the date of the fairchild agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition and c subject to certain qualifications it will provide to fairchild’s then current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition that is no less favorable than fairchild’s thenexisting policy or if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable the best available coverage 

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

see “legal proceedings” and note 12 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for possible contingencies related to legal matters see also “business—government regulation” for information on certain environmental matters 

sources and uses of cash 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments research and development to make capital expenditures to repurchase our common stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand we also have the ability to utilize our revolving credit facility 

as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 

on september 19 2016 we completed our acquisition of fairchild pursuant to the fairchild agreement the purchase price totaled 25322 million and was funded by the borrowings against our term loan “b” facility 

 

and revolving credit facility and with cash on hand see “business—2016 acquisition activity” “risk factors” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional information during 2015 and 2014 we acquired axsem aptina and truesense see note 4 “acquisitions and divestitures” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

 

  

 our ability to service our longterm debt including our 100 notes and term loan “b” facility to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next 12 months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

during the ordinary course of business we evaluate our cash requirements and if necessary adjust our expenditures for inventory operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand our capital expenditures are primarily directed toward production equipment and capacity expansion our capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives during 2016 we paid 2107 million for capital expenditures while in 2015 we paid 2708 million our current minimum commitment for 2017 is approximately 814 million the capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives our capital expenditures have historically been approximately 6 to 7 of annual revenues and we expect to continue to incur capital expenditures to support our business activities future capital expenditures may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted 

 

on april 15 2016 we entered into two new financing arrangements to secure funds for the purchase consideration of fairchild among certain other items including a 22 billion term loan “b” facility with the proceeds deposited into escrow accounts and used to finance the transaction which occurred on september 19 2016 on september 30 2016 we amended the financing arrangements and increased the term loan “b” facility by 200 million the associated interest expense related to our term loan “b” facility has had and will continue to have a material impact to our results of operations throughout the term of the amended credit agreement 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we issued 6900 million of our 100 notes and used a portion of the proceeds to pay down amounts previously drawn on our senior revolving credit facility we also increased the borrowing capacity of our senior revolving credit facility from 8000 million to 10 billion and reset the five year maturity see note 8 “longterm debt” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

on december 1 2014 we announced a capital allocation policy the “capital allocation policy” under which we intend to return to stockholders approximately 80 of free cash flow less repayments of longterm debt subject to a variety of factors including our strategic plans market and economic conditions and the board’s discretion for the purposes of the capital allocation policy we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment we also announced the 2014 share repurchase program pursuant to the capital allocation policy under the 2014 share repurchase program we intend to repurchase approximately 10 billion of our common shares over a four year period subject to the same factors and considerations described above the 2014 share repurchase program was effective december 1 2014 and the 300 million 2012 stock repurchase program was terminated on that date see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information with respect to our share repurchase program 

cash management 

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

primary cash flow sources 

our longterm cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash our cash flows from operating activities were 5812 million 4706 million and 4813 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

our cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016 increased by approximately 1106 million compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was primarily attributable to the change in working capital during the period our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on among other factors our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets 

our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below 

 

working capital 

working capital calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs in addition our working capital may be affected by acquisitions and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 3381 million as of december 31 2016 and has fluctuated between 339 million and 4240 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters our working capital including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 13665 million as of december 31 2016 and has fluctuated between 6118 million and 13665 million over the last eight quarterends working capital as of december 31 2015 was impacted by asu 201517 which we prospectively adopted and applied to our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015 and subsequent periods periods prior to december 31 2015 have not been adjusted for the adoption of asu 201517 see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives for the year ended december 31 2016 our working capital was most significantly impacted by the acquisition of fairchild and the related financing see note 8 “longterm debt” and note 9 “earnings per share and equity” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

longterm assets and liabilities 

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets and goodwill 

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt and deferred taxes consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans generally our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions for additional information see note 11 “employee benefit plans” and note 15 “income taxes” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

key financing and capital events 

overview 

for the past several years we have undertaken various measures to secure liquidity to pursue acquisitions repurchase shares of our common stock reduce interest costs amend existing key financing arrangements and in 

 

some cases extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility certain of these measures continued in 2016 set forth below is a summary of certain key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years for further discussion of our debt instruments see note 8 “longterm debt” and for further discussion on share repurchase program see note 9 “earnings per share and equity” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following i measurement of valuation allowances relating to inventories and deferred tax assets ii estimates of future payouts for customer incentives and allowances warranties and restructuring activities iii assumptions surrounding future pension obligations iv fair values of sharebased compensation and of financial instruments including derivative financial instruments v evaluations of uncertain tax positions vi estimates and assumptions used in connection with business combinations and vi future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of goodwill and longlived assets if applicable actual results could differ from these estimates 

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue to a much lesser extent from manufacturing and design services provided to customers revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss pass to the customer generally upon shipment the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues are recorded net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances 

for products sold to distributors who are entitled to returns and allowances generally referred to as “ship and credit rights” within the semiconductor industry we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues depending on if the sale originated through an on semiconductor or legacy fairchild systems and processes if the sale originated through an on semiconductor system and process revenue is recognized when on semiconductor is informed by the distributor that it has resold the products to the enduser as a result of our inability to reliably estimate up front the effects of the returns and allowances with these distributors for sales 

 

originating through an on semiconductor system and process we defer the related revenue and gross margin on sales to these distributors until it is informed by the distributor that the products have been resold to the enduser at which time the ultimate sales price is known legacy fairchild’s systems and processes enable us to estimate up front the effects of returns and allowances provided to the distributors and thereby record the net revenue at the time of sale related to a legacy fairchild system and process although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days

for products sold to nondistributors sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience our oem customers do not have the right to return products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized and are netted against revenues we review warranty and related claims activities and records provisions as necessary 

freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense when incurred taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including valueadded and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected enduser demand these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory that is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

impairment of longlived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our asset groups that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value with related gains recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

goodwill  we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable our impairment evaluation of goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not 

 

that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if this qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value no further analysis is required and goodwill is not impaired otherwise we follow a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test to determine if goodwill is impaired the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows discount and longterm growth rates we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments the assumptions about future conditions include factors such as future revenues gross profits operating expenses and industry trends changes in these estimates based on evolving economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable actual future results may differ from those estimates we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analysis 

we have determined that the divisions within our company which are components of our operating segments constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill our divisions are one level below the operating segments constituting individual businesses with our segment management conducting regular reviews of the operating results the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets associated with that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets associate with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if during this second step we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of 2017 however identification of a triggering event may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods 

defined benefit pension plans and related benefits  we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our nonus employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs and estimated withdrawal liabilities are determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates for plan obligations assumed rates of return on pension plan assets and assumed rates of compensation increase for employees participating in the plans these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment and consultation with actuaries considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans as of december 31 2016 a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately 47 million 

contingencies  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 

 

income taxes  income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under this method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

in determining the amount of the valuation allowance estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies for each taxing jurisdiction are considered if we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made which could have a material impact to our effective tax rate see note 15 “income taxes” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information see also “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  income tax provision benefit” for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

as of december 31 2016 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 36223 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 10987 million we do have interest 

 

rate exposure with respect to the 27081 million balance on our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2016 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately 135 million however some of this impact may be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows resulting from future interest payments on our variable interest rate debt 

to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures from an accounting and economic perspective however given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the united states dollar as a normal part of the reporting process our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a nonfunctional currency changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged the notional amount of foreign currency contracts at december 31 2016 and 2015 was 959 million and 898 million respectively our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies including japanese yen euros korean won malaysian ringgit philippines peso singapore dollars swiss francs chinese renminbi and czech koruna due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the us dollar for example we determined that based on a hypothetical weightedaverage change of 10 in currency exchange rates our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately 687 million for the year ended december 31 2016 assuming no offsetting hedge positions

 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 

 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the exchange act based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this form 10k our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

during 2016 we continued to enhance our controls over revenue to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors in anticipation of recording revenue at the time of sale to the distributor originating through the on semiconductor processes and aligning our revenue recognition processes between the acquired fairchild operations and on semiconductor in the first half of 2017 

there have been no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2016 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting we continue to integrate fairchild’s operations into our systems and internal control environment and expect to complete the integration by the fourth quarter of 2017 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control  integrated framework 2013  based on this assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2016 

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 excluded fairchild which was acquired by the company on september 19 2016 excluded assets of fairchild as of december 31 2016 represent approximately 25 of consolidated assets and fairchild’s revenues for the period from september 19 2016 through december 31 2016 represents approximately 11 of consolidated revenues 

 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in “exhibits and financial statement schedules” of this form 10k

company highlights for the year ended december 31 2015 

 

        recent company mergers and acquisitions 

we have historically pursued strategic acquisitions to leverage our existing capabilities and further build our business such activities continued during 2015 

pending acquisition of fairchild 

on november 18 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the “fairchild agreement” with each of fairchild semiconductor international inc a delaware corporation “fairchild” and falcon operations sub inc a delaware corporation and our whollyowned subsidiary which provides for a proposed acquisition of fairchild by us the “fairchild transaction” the total transaction value is expected to be approximately 24 billion 

pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the fairchild agreement we through falcon operations sub inc have commenced an offer the “offer” to acquire all of the outstanding shares of fairchild’s common stock par value 001 per share the “shares” for 2000 per share in cash without interest the “offer price” the offer is subject to certain conditions including the tender of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares following successful completion of the offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the fairchild agreement including the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals falcon operations sub inc will be merged with and into fairchild with fairchild surviving as our whollyowned subsidiary the “merger” at the effective time of the merger the “effective time” each outstanding share other than shares held by i on semiconductor fairchild or their respective subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time and ii stockholders of fairchild who properly exercised their appraisal rights under the delaware general corporation law will be canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the offer price in addition immediately prior to the effective time all outstanding options to purchase shares restricted stock units deferred stock units and performance units will become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive the offer price net of any applicable exercise price with respect to options 

 

we intend to finance the estimated 24 billion of cash consideration with a combination of cash on hand proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities and new fullycommitted debt financing on november 18 2015 we entered into a commitment letter the “commitment letter” with deutsche bank securities inc “dbsi” deutsche bank ag new york branch “deutsche bank” bank of america na “bank of america” and merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated “merrill lynch” pursuant to which deutsche bank and bank of america have committed to provide a 24 billion term loan facility the “term loan” and a 300 million revolving credit facility that may be increased by an additional 200 million the “revolver” together with the provision of the term loan and revolver as set forth in the commitment letter the “financing” subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions the term loan is available to i finance the offer and related merger pursuant to the fairchild agreement and ii pay fees and expenses related to the merger and the financing under the commitment letter dbsi and merrill lynch will act as joint lead arrangers and bookrunners the commitment letter provides among other matters for an initial commitment period until august 18 2016 to effect the financing subject to three onemonth extensions for regulatory approvals the actual documentation governing the financing has not been finalized and accordingly the actual terms may differ from the description of such terms in the commitment letter 

the transactions contemplated by the fairchild agreement have been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies consummation of the transactions contemplated by the fairchild agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the fairchild agreement as well as other customary closing conditions 

a detailed description of the transactions contemplated by the fairchild agreement can be found in the 8k filed by us with the sec on november 18 2015 the tender offer statement on schedule to including the related tender offer materials including the offer to purchase the related letter of transmittal and certain other tender offer documents filed by us with the sec on december 4 2015 the solicitation recommendation statement on schedule 14d9 filed by fairchild with the sec with respect to the tender offer on december 4 2015 and all subsequent amendments and supplements to those documents filed with the sec by us and fairchild we currently expect the transactions contemplated by the fairchild agreement to close late in the second quarter of 2016 factors such as the possibility of an intervening offer for fairchild or our ability to obtain the debt financing we need to consummate the fairchild transaction may affect when and whether the merger will occur

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

from time to time we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and incur additional operating losses in the future 

at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses reduced enduser demand price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity the effects of natural disasters such as the flooding in thailand or the japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011 and other factors have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns and upturns 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and as a result is subject to significant downturns and upturns the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices in the event of such a downturn our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges on the other hand significant upturns have led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in the event of such an upturn we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely 

 

affected we may also not be able to balance our expansion activities and actual demand in such an environment the overbuilding of capacity and excess increases of inventory by us and other companies can result in overcapacity in the industry and general price erosion 

we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience them in the future we cannot accurately predict the timing of the current and future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these conditions might be these future conditions in the semiconductor industry could adversely impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure to complete our acquisition of fairchild may adversely affect our business and our share price 

our and fairchild’s obligations to consummate our acquisition of fairchild are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions including i the absence of any law or order prohibiting or restraining the fairchild transaction or any law making the consummation of the fairchild transaction illegal ii there being no event that has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on either us or fairchild iii subject to certain exceptions the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties in the fairchild agreement and iv performance by on semiconductor and fairchild of their respective obligations under the fairchild agreement there can be no assurance that these conditions to the completion of the fairchild transaction will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all in addition other factors such as the possibility of an intervening offer for fairchild or our ability to obtain the debt financing we need to consummate the fairchild transaction may affect when and whether the merger will occur if the fairchild transaction is not completed our share price could fall to the extent that our current price reflects an assumption that we will complete the acquisition furthermore if the fairchild transaction is not completed we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business results of operations and share price including the following 1 we could be required to pay a termination fee of 215 million to fairchild under certain circumstances as described in the fairchild agreement 2 we would have incurred significant costs in connection with the acquisition that we would be unable to recover 3 we may be subject to legal proceedings related to failure to complete the fairchild transaction 4 the failure to consummate the fairchild transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community and 5 any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the fairchild transaction including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers vendors and employees may continue or intensify in the event the acquisition is not consummated 

in addition we would not realize any of the expected benefits of having completed the fairchild transaction the fairchild transaction if completed will be our largest acquisition to date by a significant margin the benefits we expect to realize from the acquisition of fairchild are necessarily based on projections and assumptions about combining our business with fairchild which may not materialize or which may prove to be inaccurate 

uncertainty about the fairchild transaction may adversely affect our business and share price whether or not the fairchild transaction is completed 

we are subject to risks in connection with the announcement and pendency of the fairchild transaction including 1 the pendency and outcome of the legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against us our directors and others relating to the fairchild transaction and 2 that we may forgo opportunities we might otherwise pursue absent the fairchild agreement 

 

uncertainties about the fairchild transaction may also cause our current and prospective employees including employees at fairchild to experience uncertainty about their future with us these uncertainties may impair our ability to retain recruit or motivate key management sales marketing engineering technical and other personnel 

in addition in response to the announcement of the fairchild transaction our existing or prospective customers vendors or suppliers may 1 delay defer or cease purchasing goods or services from or providing goods or services to us 2 delay or defer other decisions concerning us or refuse to extend credit to us or 3 otherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with us 

while we are attempting to address these risks through communications with our existing and prospective customers vendors and suppliers they may be reluctant to purchase our products due to potential uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings and the support and service of our products after we complete the fairchild transaction 

we may fail to realize the benefits expected from the fairchild transaction which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 

although we expect significant benefits to result from the fairchild transaction there can be no assurance that we will actually realize these or any other anticipated benefits of the fairchild transaction the price for our stock following completion of the fairchild transaction may be affected by our ability to achieve the benefits expected to result from the fairchild transaction achieving the benefits of the fairchild transaction will depend in part on our ability to integrate fairchild’s business successfully and efficiently with our business 

we intend to finance the estimated 24 billion of cash consideration with a combination of cash on hand new fullycommitted debt financing and proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities the debt that we expect to incur will bear interest based on floating rate indices or in the event of the issuance of any debt securities at fixed rates to be determined at the time of issuance based on prevailing market conditions as a result increases in prevailing interest rates related to this new debt financing would result in a higher cost of capital and significantly increase our annual interest expense even though the amounts borrowed would remain the same which likely would reduce the anticipated benefits of the fairchild transaction and would adversely affect our cash flows financial condition and results of operations 

the challenges involved in this integration which will be complex and time consuming include the following 1 demonstrating to customers of on semiconductor and fairchild that the fairchild transaction will not adversely affect our ability to address the needs of customers or result in the loss of attention or business focus 2 coordinating and integrating research and development and engineering teams across technologies and product platforms to enhance product development while reducing costs 3 consolidating and integrating corporate information technology finance and administrative infrastructures 4 coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities and the direction of product development and 5 minimizing the diversion of management attention from important business objectives 

if we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating fairchild then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the fairchild transaction and our postacquisition revenue expenses results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected any of which could materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

 

litigation challenging the fairchild agreement may prevent the fairchild transaction from being consummated at all or within the expected timeframe 

fairchild fairchild’s board of directors on semiconductor and our whollyowned subsidiary falcon operations sub inc are currently parties to a putative shareholder class action related to the fairchild transaction and may be parties to additional similar claims and litigation among other remedies the plaintiff in the proceeding to which we are a party seeks to enjoin the fairchild transaction the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the fairchild transaction from becoming effective in a timely manner the pending litigation is and any additional litigation could be time consuming and expensive could divert our management’s attention away from their regular business and if any one of these lawsuits is adversely resolved against either us or fairchild could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to effect the fairchild transaction 

one of the conditions to closing the fairchild transaction is that no governmental entity having jurisdiction over us or fairchild shall have issued an order decree or ruling or taken any other material action enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the fairchild transaction substantially on the terms contemplated by the fairchild agreement and that no law shall have been enacted or promulgated by any governmental entity that makes the consummation of the fairchild transaction illegal consequently if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in the lawsuits referenced above and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting delaying or otherwise adversely affecting our ability to complete the fairchild transaction on terms contemplated by the fairchild agreement then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the fairchild transaction from being effective in a timely manner or at all for additional information regarding this litigation see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” under the heading “legal matters” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by significant price erosion especially after a product has been on the market for a significant period of time 

one of the results of the rapid innovation in the semiconductor industry is that pricing pressure especially with respect to products containing older technology can be intense product life cycles are relatively short and as a result products tend to be replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes on a frequent basis in turn demand for older technology falls causing the price at which such products can be sold to drop in some cases precipitously in order to continue to profitably supply these products we must reduce our production costs in line with the lower prices we can expect to receive per unit usually this must be accomplished through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies if we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of these products moreover we may not be able to cease production of such products either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and as a result may be required to bear a loss on such products should reductions in our manufacturing costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell this could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

economic conditions including those related to the credit markets may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

adverse global economic conditions may result in fluctuations and reductions in consumer and commercial spending from time to time and such conditions or uncertainties about such conditions may result in lower orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the semiconductor industry has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of 

 

declines in general economic conditions volatility in global economic conditions including the level of the economic recovery in the united states the growth rate of the chinese economy the effect of conditions in japan including a weakened demand environment and japanese yen and economic weakness in many other countries and regions volatility in oil prices and conflicts in eastern europe and the middle east may adversely and materially affect our industry business and results of operations and we cannot accurately predict volatility or how severe and prolonged any downturn or recovery might be reduced spending has in the past driven us and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which results in a negative effect on gross profit in addition to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected our business and results of operations could be adversely and materially affected moreover volatility in revenues as a result of unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our shortterm and longterm strategies 

furthermore the united states and global credit markets could experience renewed financial turmoil if the past pressures on credit were renewed or we experience an additional global downturn we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all and we may not be able to refinance if necessary any outstanding debt when due all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity on terms acceptable to us to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures for the immediate future if our operating results falter and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition global financial uncertainty affecting the financial markets and economies generally could impact our business in a number of other ways including causing 1 our customers and consumers in general to defer purchases 2 our customers difficulties in obtaining sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us 3 our key suppliers to become capacityconstrained or insolvent resulting in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and 4 our key suppliers to require acceleration of payments to them or our customers to delay payments to us any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses incurring additional debt assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 

in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other factors efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts we face risks resulting from the expansion of our operations through acquisitions including but not limited to 1 the difficulty of integrating aligning and coordinating organizations which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures 2 risks of entering new semiconductor markets or regions of the world in which we have limited experience 3 risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies 4 the risk that our due diligence in the acquisition process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities that are in existence at the time of our acquisitions 5 the risk that our existing or prospective customers or customers of the acquired business may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions as we integrate new businesses and companies into our business or that they may seek to change their existing business relationships 6 challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions including difficulties in entering into new market segments in which we are not experienced 

 

7 the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets 8 difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses 9 the diversion of management’s attention from the daily operations of existing businesses and 10 negative pressure on gross margins resulting from increased operating and restructuring costs 

the integration of newly acquired businesses will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships moreover even if we were able to fully integrate a new acquisition’s business operations and other assets successfully there can be no assurance that such integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible or were anticipated from the acquisition or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time delays in integrating our acquisitions which could be caused by factors outside of our control could adversely affect the intended benefits of the acquisitions to our business financial results financial condition and the trading price of our stock and other securities 

in addition current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us and as a result we could lose key employees these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel in connection with a transaction key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in the form of changeincontrol agreements acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equitybased compensation rights these amounts could impact their willingness to continue to work for us further as a result of our acquisitions we may assume liabilities from the target’s current employee benefit plans that may require us to bring plan documentation into compliance with current law including ensuring that plans are adequately funded 

in connection with our acquisition activity we are required by generally accepted accounting principles and sec rules and regulations to integrate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or if they do have independent audited financial statements such statements may not be prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems which could materially impair our ability to obtain or prepare necessary financial information concerning such businesses in a format required to allow proper integration with our systems and financial statements in addition immediately after an acquisition and until such time as we are able to fully integrate an acquired business into our financial statements we may be dependent on the acquired business’ financial controls and systems for reporting and other financial information including projections and goals for such acquired business we may not be able to successfully prepare and file required financial statements or other financial information for the acquired business or to integrate the acquired business into our financial controls and systems and our consolidated financial statements in a timely manner failure to prepare accurate financial reports for our acquired businesses in a timely manner in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could cause material inaccuracies in our financial statements and sec filings which could result in the necessity to restate our financials or lead to unknown liabilities and possibly result in a material impact on the trading price of our stock and other securities 

in connection with an acquisition including the acquisition of fairchild it is possible that we may anticipate tax savings through integration of the newly acquired business into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure as with any estimate it is possible that the estimates of the potential savings could turn out to be incorrect 

 

we review goodwill associated with our acquisitions for impairment at least on an annual basis see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” note 2 “significant accounting policies  goodwill” and note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our consolidated audited financial statements located elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information about goodwill in the past we have recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions factors we consider important that could result in a subsequent impairment to goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends we may have further material goodwill impairments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our financial position and operating results in any such case it is possible that factors outside of our control including but not limited to increases in interest rates and loss of key customers could adversely affect the intended benefits from an acquisition even though we would continue to have a repayment obligation under the related loan agreement 

our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization and realizing expected synergies from acquisitions 

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs and depreciation expense we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing for instance if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits 

moreover we believe that we will need to continue to improve the margin levels of our system solutions group while we anticipate that certain cost reduction measures taken including voluntary retirement programs implemented in 2013 and 2014 should improve the margin levels of the system solutions group business we may benefit fully from such actions and may need to take additional cost reduction measures 

the failure to successfully implement profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions including restructuring activities could adversely affect our business 

from time to time we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to among other factors significant downturns in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs have been primarily composed of employee separation costs and asset impairments see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  operating expenses” under the heading “restructuring asset impairments and other net” and note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on restructuring activities 

 

we also often undertake restructuring activities in connection with our business acquisitions which can result in significant charges including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges 

we cannot assure you that our restructuring plans and cost reduction initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition 

for additional information regarding our profitability enhancement programs and cost reduction measures see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  operating expenses” under the heading “restructuring asset impairments and other net” and note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 continue to aggressively manage maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 further expand our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 rationalize our manufacturing operations 7 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 8 reduce selling and administrative expenses 9 manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands 10 actively manage working capital 11 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 12 integrate newly acquired products manufacturing capabilities and sales channels we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other factors to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our ip portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these factors and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities the impact of natural disasters and cyber attacks increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

 

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  operating expenses” under the heading “research and development” for a description of our expenditures for research and development 

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process and often requires significant capital investment additionally expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured there can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” for new products new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products including any delays in establishing sufficient manufacturing capacity could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue in addition design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or that we will generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers including changes due to evolving consumer preferences international political developments influencing enduser preferences and natural disasters or other extraordinary events that impact our customers or endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive there is no assurance that the products we develop and market will be well received by customers that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop new products that a significant investment in new products will be profitable or that we will have margins as high as we anticipate at the time of investment or have experienced historically further a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

uncertainties involving the timing and amount of orders and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days for custom products without incurring a significant penalty we routinely generate inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in 

 

addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends although only a few companies compete with us in most of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fully customized ics as well as from customers who develop their own ic products in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future in different product lines we compete to varying degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers tablets industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods any inability to maintain revenues or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and on our business and prospects as a whole 

the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidation that could adversely affect our competitiveness many of our competitors particularly larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency is and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other conditions and events capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities including as a part of our cost reduction measures and in reaction to manmade and natural 

 

disasters such as the 2011 flooding in thailand upgrading or expanding existing facilities changing our process technologies or uncertainty as a result of the acquisition and integration of manufacturing facilities acquired as a result of our acquisition activities any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing information technology and equipment to remain competitive and any failure inadequacy or delayed implementation could harm our ability to effectively operate our business such capital expenditures and commitments as well as other commitments may materially decrease our liquidity 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices our manufacturing assembly and test facilities have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume however there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and utilize these new technologies there also is no assurance that the new technologies we do develop and utilize will be sufficient to support our business operations and strategies or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such new technologies 

we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency any such implementation however can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or in some instances to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned in the case of abandonment we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

in the recent past we have undertaken various and material cost reduction measures which we believe have been largely successful however these reductions and any future reductions may unintentionally affect our ability to remain competitive in efficiency and productivity ultimately we may be forced to increase our future capital expenditures in unexpected ways to meet our operational needs in among other areas manufacturing information technology and equipment we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make timely and necessary investments in the areas discussed above or other areas we have not identified 

we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and other business disruptions 

our worldwide operations are subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions from time to time which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial reporting and condition we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods hurricanes typhoons droughts and other extreme weather conditions earthquakes tsunamis volcanoes and similar natural disasters as well as power outages power shortages telecommunications failures industrial accidents and similar events such events can cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property including our books and financial and corporate records and data and related internal controls and can also have significant direct and indirect consequences for example such events can negatively impact revenues and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event such costs may include expenses to 

 

restore production or to move production to other facilities including incremental capital expenditures and costs for expedited shipping expenses incurred with a shutdown of the damaged facility including employee severance payments and other unusual costs and expenses such as fixed asset impairments inventory writedowns charges relating to cancellation of purchase orders for excess materials and charges for restoration and recovery work overall costs may also be impacted by other factors such as the underabsorption of our manufacturing and operating support overhead for example in the case of our facility in roznov czech republic that manufactures silicon wafers used by a number of our facilities any natural or manmade disaster operational disruption or other extraordinary event that impacted the facility or regional infrastructure would have a substantial adverse effect on our ability to produce a number of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business revenues costs andor prospects if we were unable to effectively source silicon wafers on acceptable terms from qualified third parties to replace the production loss such events may also affect the infrastructure of the country in which the event occurs causing water damage power outages and rolling blackouts transportation delays and restrictions public health issues and economic instability and disrupting local and international supply chains as a result we could experience shortages of and interruptions in supply and increased prices for components that we source from companies located in or with operations in any such country as well as from other suppliers whose supply chains may similarly be affected such shortages and interruptions may also affect our ability to communicate with our customers and suppliers and to timely deliver our products to customers and as a result our customers may seek substitute products from other manufacturers in addition damage or destruction to our books and financial and corporate records and data could adversely affect our ability to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the historical and future reporting of our financial results and our ability to integrate the financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies responding to natural disasters and their consequences will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above such insurance may be subject to deductible and coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not turn to other suppliers significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects see part i item 1 “business  customers” for a description of revenues from our largest customers 

we rely on customers in the automotive and communications industries for a significant portion of our revenue 

a significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive and communications industries including networking sales into these industries represented approximately 33 and 18 of our revenue respectively for the year ended december 31 2015 and those percentages will vary from quarter to quarter both the automotive and communications industries are cyclical and as a result our customers in these industries are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions which can adversely affect sales of our products 

 

additionally the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in these industries could decline despite continued growth in these end markets lower sales to customers in the automotive or communications industry may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner the costs of our raw materials increase significantly their quality deteriorates or the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including polysilicon silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

in addition for some of our products we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt production in material ways in addition we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect in any such case arranging for replacement contractors can be time consuming and costly and we may encounter startup difficulties 

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the asiapacific region the americas and europe and we maintain significant operations in these regions in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

 

  

             other activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange for instance while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we have historically benefited from relatively low effective tax rates because most of our income has been earned and reinvested in jurisdictions outside the us however our effective tax rate is uncertain on an ongoing basis changes to income tax regulations in the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could under our existing tax structure significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operations and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition other factors or events including business combinations and investment transactions changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns or as a result of deficiencies asserted by taxing authorities increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in available tax credits increasing operations in high tax jurisdictions and changes in tax rates could also increase our future effective tax rate 

our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign taxing authorities we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

 

further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” the oecd which represents a coalition of member countries recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these changes if adopted by countries could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the us a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time 

the distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the united states may be subject to united states income taxes thus reducing our net income 

we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt repurchases payments acquisitions including our potential acquisition of fairchild and stock repurchases if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations through borrowings under our current debt agreements or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

except as required under us tax law we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings any such taxes would reduce our net income in the period in which these earnings are distributed 

we operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies andor legal entity structures which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are therefore subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties there is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties based on our current knowledge and probability assessment of potential outcomes we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures however the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

our legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operational results changes in tax laws regulations future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in us becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

 

a significant amount of our international business is transacted in local currency and a significant percentage of our cash and cash equivalents are held outside of the united states which exposes us to risk relating to currency fluctuations changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs which could negatively impact our sales profitability and financial flexibility 

we have sizeable sales and operations in asia and european regions a significant amount of this business is transacted in local currency as a result our financial performance is impacted by currency fluctuations 

a significant percentage of our cash and cash equivalents is currently held outside the united states and we continue to generate profits outside of the united states while many of our liabilities including our outstanding indebtedness and certain other cash payments such as share repurchases are payable in us dollars 

repatriation of some of the funds held outside the united states could have potential adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay because of required local country approvals or local obligations in addition at times we are required to make cash deposits to support bank guarantees of our obligations under certain office leases or amounts we owe to certain vendors from whom we purchase goods and services nearly all of these arrangements are outside of the united states and these cash deposits are not available for other uses as long as the bank guarantees are outstanding foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency as a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the united states our financial flexibility may be reduced which could have an adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations our balance of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 5178 million at december 31 2014 and our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 6176 million at december 31 2015 and of those amounts approximately 2036 million and 2407 million was available in the united states at december 31 2014 and 2015 respectively 

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

our success both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions depends upon our ability to attract retain and motivate highlyskilled design technical managerial marketing and financial personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive in addition from time to time we have announced certain cost reductions that included the freezing of salaries and elimination of bonuses mandatory unpaid time off factory shutdowns and reduction in personnel we also establish performance criteria for awards to officers and employees under bonus and other incentive plans and programs that may not be satisfied these measures as well as any future measures could negatively affect morale and lead to unintended employee attrition at all levels of our organization moreover we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel and our existing employment agreements do not require the employee to continue to work for us 

as employee incentives we have issued common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time rsus with timebased vesting and performancebased awards any difficulty relating to obtaining stockholder approval of new or amendments to equity compensation plans could limit our ability to issue these types of awards our stock price at times has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of certain of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered ip assets patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies these laws and regulations are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts additionally some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications with respect to our ip generally we cannot assure you that 

 

    in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective ip protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty ip rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such ip rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for ip we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

 

      we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

we also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to ip arising out of our research 

 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

our ability to enforce our patents trademarks copyrights software licenses and other ip is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged ip rights 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

all industries including the semiconductor industry are subject to legal claims including securities litigation litigation in connection with acquisitions and litigation over executive compensation and disclosure of executive compensation the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future in addition we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions and executive compensation will not subject us to additional litigation this sort of litigation can be particularly costly and may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general we are involved in a variety of legal matters most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers employment and labor and ip we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however defense and settlement costs can be substantial even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows further uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for more information on our legal proceedings 

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards 

like most publicly traded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm as we continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future 

 

there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future failure to comply with sox including delaying or failing to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such transactions and the trading price of our common stock or other securities may decline in addition if we fail to remedy any material weakness our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements our financial statements may be materially inaccurate our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 

regulations that impose disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in our products will result in additional cost and expense and could result in other significant adverse effects 

rules adopted by the sec implementing the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in our products compliance with these rules will result in additional cost and expense including for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities these rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our semiconductor devices as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals or components that can be used in our products there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such metals or components in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices the cost of compliance to our service providers foundries subcontractors and suppliers could also be passed along to us resulting in higher prices for the materials or components we use in our products also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the metals used in our products we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other requirements regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operation of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization and spinout from motorola we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities 

 

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

 

     warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process requiring production in a tightly controlled clean environment minute impurities in our manufacturing materials contaminants in the manufacturing environment manufacturing equipment failures and other defects can cause our products to be noncompliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design oems are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage if any and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved in certain instances we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective 

new legal requirements particularly with respect to health care reform could increase the cost of our employee benefits and adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations 

we incur significant costs to maintain competitive employee benefits to attract and retain our highly skilled personnel changes to the regulatory environment with respect to these benefits could adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations in particular the health care reform legislation enacted by the us congress is intended to result in significant changes to the us health care system this legislation may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of the new healthcare regulations and may impair our ability to provide the same level of coverage 

 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could damage our reputation and harm our business and operating results 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses illegal hacking or acts of vandalism or terrorism additionally the proprietary sensitive or confidential information we manage and store may be subject to accidental loss misuse inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination our security measures andor those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches in some cases we may initially be unaware of an incident or its magnitude or effects the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we also provide certain confidential and proprietary information to our third party service providers and other business partners and the systems of these third parties could be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromised any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business cause an interruption in our operations result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data result in a violation of privacy or other laws expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation which could harm our business and operating results 

we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data about our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceedings 

the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance regulatory environment costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant in addition our even inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties 

we sell a significant and increasing portion of our products through distributors using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks distributors may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

in the ordinary course of business we have substantial debt service obligations on may 1 2015 we amended our senior revolving credit facility to among other things increase the borrowing capacity to 10 billion and on june 8 2015 we issued 6900 million aggregate principal amount of our 100 notes we incur debt from time to time to repay or refinance other outstanding debt to make acquisitions or for other purposes see note 20 “recent developments and subsequent events” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a description of certain additional debt we may acquire in connection with our acquisition of fairchild the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

 

         we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with our acquisition of fairchild see note 20 “recent developments and subsequent events” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a description of certain additional debt we may acquire in connection with our acquisition of fairchild the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness from time to time may limit us and our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next 12 months if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities moreover the debt we may incur from time to time may require collateral to secure such indebtedness which would place our assets at risk as well as limit our flexibility 

 

related to such assets ultimately we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all and we may need to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

our debt agreements from time to time may contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other decisions we might make our ability to 

 

          such agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements including to maintain certain financial ratios and condition tests our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness which could impact our operations in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments a default under our committed credit facilities including our senior revolving credit facility could also limit our ability to make further borrowings under those facilities as a result of these restrictions we may be limited in how we conduct our business unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities these restrictions may also affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy 

 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements from time to time may contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to the current stockholders 

we conduct our operations through subsidiaries who may have no independent obligation to repay our debt 

we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time including under our senior revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

servicing the 100 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 100 notes in a timely manner 

in june 2015 we issued 6900 million aggregate principal amount of our 100 notes holders of the 100 notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a 

 

fundamental change as defined under the indenture governing the 100 notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 100 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change repurchase date in addition upon conversion of the 100 notes to be repurchased unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 100 notes being converted moreover we will be required to repay the 100 notes in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted or repurchased servicing the 100 notes may require a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 100 notes our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 100 notes repurchase the 100 notes in the event of a fundamental change or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the 100 notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock which would dilute existing stockholders in addition if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the 100 notes following a fundamental change we would be in default under the terms of the 100 notes which could cross default other debt and materially adversely harm our business the terms of the 100 notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur and if we incur significantly more debt this could intensify the risks described above our decision to use our cash for other purposes such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock could also intensify these risks see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on our 100 notes 

the conditional conversion feature of the 100 notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding september 1 2020 holders may convert the 100 notes only if specified conditions are met in the event the conditional conversion feature of the 100 notes is triggered holders of the 100 notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option if one or more holders elect to convert their 100 notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash which could adversely affect our liquidity in addition if the conditional conversion feature of the 100 notes is triggered even if holders do not elect to convert their 100 notes we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 100 notes as a current rather than longterm liability which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital 

note hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may affect the value of the 100 notes and our common stock 

concurrently with the issuance of the 100 notes we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions which we refer to as the option counterparties the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the 100 notes andor offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 100 notes as the case may be we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties however the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds 2596 see note 9 “earnings per share and equity” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

 

in connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock andor entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock following the pricing of the 100 notes in addition the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 100 notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 100 notes or following any repurchase of the 100 notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise the potential effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock or the 100 notes 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions 

the option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral if one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions 

our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock in addition upon a default by one of the option counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties 

the fundamental change repurchase feature of our convertible notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company 

the terms of our convertible notes require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change in certain circumstances a takeover of our company could trigger an option of the holders of the notes to require us to repurchase the notes this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors in the notes a change of control may also trigger a default or other consequences under certain of our other indebtedness including our senior revolving credit facility 

conversion of convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders including holders who had previously converted their convertible notes or may otherwise depress the price of our stock 

under the terms of the 2625 notes series b any conversions of the 2625 notes series b will be settled in cash up to the par value of the notes being converted with the excess of the conversion value over the par value being settled in shares of common stock subject to our ability to settle the entire amount in cash generally speaking this would result in the issuance of common stock upon the conversion of the 2625 notes series b only if our common stock is trading at a value in excess of 1050 per share and we do not elect to pay the entire amount in cash or are unable to do so the conversion of some or all of the 2625 notes series b into common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and may impact the value of our common stock the 2625 notes series b will become fully convertible on june 15 2016 prior to that date the 2625 notes series b will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary events we may also elect 

 

to settle the 100 notes in common stock cash or a combination thereof for a description of the conversion features of the 100 notes and for other information regarding our convertible notes see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the dilutive effect of convertible notes on the calculation of our earnings per share is described in note 9 “earnings per share and equity” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may impact the value of our common stock a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter in addition to the other factors described above factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

 

              our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors among others some of which are beyond our control 

 

   

     the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had significant variance and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

 

   certain change in control restrictions in certain of our debt agreements may have similar effects although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

 worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew 04 in 2011 declined 26 in 2012 grew 48 in 2013 grew 99 in 2014 and declined 02 in 2015 following a pattern associated with the financial crisis subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty the decrease of 02 from 2014 to 2015 is related to the challenging global macroeconomic conditions within the semiconductor industry which continue to affect sales in all geographic regions  sales in our sam decreased to 1074 billion in 2011 decreased to 1037 billion in 2012 increased to 1043 billion in 2013 increased to 1161 billion in 2014 and decreased to 1159 billion in 2015 the decrease of approximately 02 from 1161 billion in 2014 to 1159 billion in 2015 is consistent with the trend in the worldwide semiconductor market the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our sam of approximately 4 for the next three years these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 

recent results 

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 were 34958 million an increase of approximately 11 from 31618 million from the year ended december 31 2014 the majority of the increase was attributable to our 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense which experienced a full year of operations during 2015 partially offset by decreased revenue from our system solutions group  during 2015 we reported net income attributable to on semiconductor corporation of 2062 million compared to net income attributable to on semiconductor corporation of 1897 million in 2014 our gross margin decreased by approximately 20 basis points to 341 in 2015 from 343 in 2014 primarily driven by changes in volume and mix across certain of our product lines

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have reduced or shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have caused demand to strengthen production volumes have historically stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand reaches levels above capacity production capabilities shortages begin to occur which typically causes pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

business and macroeconomic environment influence on cost savings and restructuring activities 

we have recognized efficiencies from previously implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure however the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions we have historically reviewed and will continue to review our cost structure capital investments and other expenditures to align our spending and capacity with our current sales and manufacturing projections 

we have historically taken significant actions to align our overall cost structure with our expected revenue levels such actions continued in 2015 see “results of operations” under the heading “restructuring asset 

 

impairments and other net” below along with note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information relating to our most recent cost saving actions 

outlook 

on semiconductor q1 2016 outlook 

based upon product booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we estimate that our revenues will be approximately 800 to 840 million in the first quarter of 2016 backlog levels for the first quarter of 2016 represent approximately 80 to 85 of our anticipated first quarter 2016 revenues we estimate average selling prices for the first quarter of 2016 will be down approximately 2 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 for the first quarter of 2016 we estimate that gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be approximately 318 to 338 our outlook does not include any contributions from the acquisition of fairchild 

results of operations 

our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 include the results of operations from our acquisitions of aptina truesense and axsem on august 15 2014 april 30 2014 and july 15 2015 respectively 

 

operating results 

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 in millions 

 

 revenues 

revenues were 34958 million 31618 million and 27827 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase of approximately 11 in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily attributed to approximately 4096 million of additional revenue in the image sensor group provided by a full year of operations from the 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense partially offset by decreased revenue from our system solutions group and a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 8 

the increase in revenues from 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily attributed to approximately 2624 million of additional revenue in the image sensor group provided by the acquisitions of aptina and truesense along 

 

with increases from our application products group and standard products group which experienced greater revenue as a result of an improved demand environment the increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased revenue from our system solutions group

 1 certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts 

revenues from the application products group 

revenues from the application products group decreased by 139 million or approximately 1 during 2015 compared to 2014 and increased by 736 million or approximately 7 during 2014 compared to 2013 

the 2015 decrease resulted from a decrease in revenues from analog products of 185 million or approximately 5 a decrease in revenues from tmos products of 50 million or approximately 11 partially offset by an increase in revenues from asic products of 133 million or approximately 2 

the 2014 increase resulted from an increase in revenues from asic products of 444 million or approximately 9 an increase in revenues from analog products of 132 million or approximately 3 an increase in revenues from foundry services of 88 million or approximately 65 and an increase in revenues from tmos products of 78 million or approximately 20 

revenues from the image sensor group 

revenues from the image sensor group increased by 4112 million during 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 2666 million during 2014 compared to 2013 

this increase is primarily attributable to revenue provided by the 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense which generated approximately 4096 million of additional revenue attributable to a full year of operations during 2015 compared to 2014 and 2624 million of revenue during the post combination period of 2014 

revenues from the standard products group 

revenues from the standard products group increased by 47 million or less than 1 during 2015 compared to 2014 and increased by 892 million or approximately 8 during 2014 compared to 2013 

 

the 2015 increase resulted from an increase in revenues from our memory products of 167 million or approximately 24 an increase in revenues from analog products of 51 million or approximately 2 and an increase in revenues from discrete products of 30 million or approximately 1 partially offset by a decrease in revenues from tmos products of 146 million or approximately 6 

the 2014 increase resulted from an increase in revenues from discrete products of 604 million or approximately 14 an increase in revenues from analog products of 241 million or approximately 8 and an increase in revenues from memory products of 113 million or approximately 20 partially offset by a decrease in revenues from tmos products 

revenues from the system solutions group 

revenues from the system solutions group decreased by 680 million or approximately 12 during 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased by 503 million or approximately 8 during 2014 compared to 2013 

the 2015 decrease is primarily attributable to a 483 million or approximately 13 decrease in revenue from lsi products and a 141 million or approximately 13 decrease in revenue from hic products resulting from a softening of the japanese consumer endmarkets and an increase in competition in other regions 

the 2014 decrease resulted from a decrease in demand from the japanese consumer market and an increase in competition in other regions causing a decrease in revenue from lsi products of approximately 538 million or approximately 13

gross profit and gross margin exclusive of amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets described below 

our gross profit by reportable segment in each of the three years below was as follows dollars in millions 

 

 1 unallocated manufacturing costs are being shown as a percentage of total revenue 

2 certain of the amounts may not total due to rounding of individual amounts 

3 during the third quarter of 2015 the company began allocating certain manufacturing costs to its segments that were previously included as unallocated manufacturing costs comparative information has been recast to conform with the current period presentation unallocated manufacturing costs are shown as a percentage of total revenue 

our gross profit was 11932 million 10849 million and 9291 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the gross profit increase of 1083 million or approximately 10 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the contributions of our recent acquisitions approximately 270 million for the amortization of the fair market value of inventory stepup from our acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2014 for which there was no amortization during 2015 and manufacturing and cost improvements that were partially offset by decreased average selling prices 

the gross profit increase during 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to increased revenues along with increased capacity utilization and cost savings realized from previous restructuring activities partially offset by decreased average selling prices and approximately 270 million for the expensing of the fair market value of inventory stepup from our acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2014 

gross margin decreased to approximately 341 during 2015 compared to approximately 343 during 2014 this decrease was primarily driven by a larger proportion of our revenues provided by our image sensor group which generates lower gross margin levels than our application products group and standard products group 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily driven by favorable changes in volume and mix across certain product lines as well as a larger proportion of revenues generated from our applications products group image sensor group and standard products group which experienced higher gross margin levels than our system solutions group

see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

restructuring asset impairments and other net 

restructuring asset impairments and other net was 93 million 305 million and 332 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the information below summarizes the major activities in each year for additional information see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k we may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods including charges as a result of acquisitions that we expect to close or may make in the future particularly fairchild 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we recorded approximately 93 million of net charges related to our restructuring programs consisting primarily of 35 million of employee separation charges from our european marketing organization relocation plan and 48 million of general workforce reductions total restructuring asset impairments and other net was partially offset by a 34 million gain from the sale of assets and the change in foreign currency for our kss facility 

during the first quarter of 2015 the company announced that it would relocate its european customer marketing organization from france to slovakia and germany as a result six positions are expected to be eliminated the company recorded 35 million of related employee separation charges during the year ended december 31 2015 the impacted employees are expected to exit during the second half of 2016 

during the third quarter of 2015 management approved and commenced implementation of restructuring actions primarily targeted workforce reductions the company notified approximately 150 employees of their employment termination the majority of which had exited by december 31 2015 the total expense for the year ended december 31 2015 was 48 million 

 

2014 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we initiated a voluntary retirement program for employees of certain of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan the “q4 2013 voluntary retirement program” approximately 350 employees opted to retire under the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program of which all employees had exited by december 31 2014 for the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized approximately 104 million of employee separation charges related to the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program 

in connection with the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program approximately 70 contractor positions were also identified for elimination all of which all had exited by the end of 2015 during the year ended december 31 2014 an additional 40 positions were identified for elimination as an extension of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program consisting of 20 employees and 20 contractors substantially all of which had exited by december 31 2014 

as a result of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program we recognized a pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees of 45 million during the year ended december 31 2014 which is recorded in restructuring asset impairments and other net see note 11 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we initiated further voluntary retirement activities applicable to an additional 60 to 70 positions for certain of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan consisting of employees and contractors substantially all personnel had exited under this program by december 31 2014 

on october 6 2013 we announced a plan to close kss the “kss plan” pursuant to the kss plan a majority of the production from kss was transferred to other of our manufacturing facilities the kss plan includes the elimination of approximately 170 full time and 40 contract employees during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded approximately 78 million of employee separation charges and 23 million of exit costs related to the kss plan 

as a result of the kss facility closure we recognized a 21 million pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees during the year ended december 31 2014 which was recorded in restructuring asset impairments and other net see note 11 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we initiated two voluntary retirement programs for certain employees of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan approximately 500 employees opted to retire pursuant to the first program and substantially all employees had retired by december 31 2013 approximately 170 employees had retired by december 31 2013 under the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program as part of these restructuring activities approximately half of the 70 contractor positions identified for elimination were terminated by the end of 2013 

we recorded net charges of approximately 373 million in connection with these programs consisting of employee severance charges of 529 million partially offset by pension and related retirement liability adjustments associated with the affected employees which resulted in a pension curtailment benefit of 156 million 

 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded 31 million of restructuring charges related to the announced closure of our aizu facility we also released approximately 210 million of associated cumulative foreign currency translation gains related to our subsidiary that owned the aizu facility which utilized the japanese yen as its functional currency the related amount was recorded as a benefit to restructuring asset impairments and other net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for additional information see note 16 “changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

we recorded approximately 100 million of net restructuring charges related to the kss plan during the year ended december 31 2013 consisting of employee severance charges of 65 million and 35 million of asset impairment charges associated with the kss plan 

indefinite and longlived asset impairment charges 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we canceled certain of our previously capitalized iprd projects and recorded impairment losses of 38 million see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we determined that approximately 87 million in carrying value of goodwill relating to one of our reporting units in the application products group was impaired resulting from a decline in estimated future cash flows in connection with this impairment we wroteoff approximately 09 million of intangible assets and 47 million of other longlived assets see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

other income and expenses 

interest expense 

interest expense increased by 156 million to 497 million during 2015 compared to 341 million in 2014 additionally interest expense decreased by 45 million to 341 million during 2014 from 386 million in 2013 we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of 175 million 70 million and 112 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively our average gross amount of longterm debt balance including current maturities during 2015 2014 and 2013 was 13616 million 10856 million and 10036 million respectively our weighted average interest rate on our gross amount of longterm debt including current maturities was approximately 37 31 and 38 per annum in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources  key financing and capital events” below for a description of our refinancing activities 

we expect interest expense to increase substantially in future periods starting in the first quarter of 2016 due to the increased amount of debt we expect to incur in connection with the completion of the fairchild transaction as well as related fees that may be associated with the syndication of that debt in advance of closing the transaction 

 

other 

other income increased by 121 million during 2015 compared to 2014 from expense of 44 million in 2014 to income of 77 million in 2015 other income decreased by 59 million during 2014 compared to 2013 from a gain of 15 million in 2013 to a loss of 44 million in 2014 the change from year to year is largely attributable to fluctuations in foreign currencies against the dollar for the periods presented net of the impact from our hedging activity along with gains and losses on availableforsale securities 

loss on debt extinguishment 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we amended our senior revolving credit facility to among other things increase the borrowing capacity to 10 billion and reset the facility’s five year maturity as a result of the amendment we wroteoff 04 million of existing debt issuance costs associated with the facility resulting in a loss during the year ended december 31 2015 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we exchanged 600 million in principal value 574 million of carrying value of our 2625 notes for 585 million in principal value of our 2625 notes series b plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2625 notes resulting in a loss on debt repurchase of 31 million subject to certain other terms and conditions this transaction extended the earliest put date for the exchanged amount from december 2013 to december 2016 

see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

income tax provision benefit 

we recorded an income tax provision of 108 million a benefit of 02 million and a provision of 164 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2015 consisted of the reversal of 121 million of our previously established valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets the release of 43 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions that were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during the year ended december 31 2015 and a change in tax rate that favorably impacted deferred balances by 16 million this is partially offset by 244 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations and 44 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions 

the 2014 income tax benefit of 02 million consisted of the reversal 233 million of our previously established valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as a result of a net deferred tax liability recorded as part of the truesense acquisition and the reversal of 46 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions that were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during the year ended december 31 2014 this is partially offset by 198 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations 46 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions and 33 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill 

 

the 2013 provision of 164 million included 222 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations 09 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions and 27 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill this is partially offset by the reversal of 60 million of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and the reversal of 34 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2013 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2015 was a provision of 49 which differs from the us statutory federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to our change in valuation allowance deemed dividend income from foreign subsidiaries and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries our effective tax rate was also lower than the us statutory federal income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our domestic and japan related deferred tax assets however it is reasonably possible that a substantial portion of the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets will be reversed within one year of december 31 2015 which is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s cash taxes as of december 31 2015 the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets was approximately 3304 million 

except as required under us tax law we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings accordingly we have not provided for 541 million of deferred income taxes on approximately 13077 million of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2015 over which we have sufficient influence to control the distribution of such earnings these deferred income taxes would be required to be recognized if we ever determined that our undistributed earnings were no longer indefinitely reinvested outside the us 

for additional information see note 15 “income taxes” of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

our pending acquisition of fairchild could cause us to reassess our indefinite reinvestment determination and valuation allowance at a future point in time when management believes all closing conditions associated with such acquisition have been obtained if such a reassessment by us was to occur and if we make a change with respect to our indefinite reinvestment determination or valuation allowance such a change in judgment could impact our effective tax rate in the period in which such change in judgment occurs any such change in judgment in our indefinite reinvestment assertion could negatively impact our effective tax rate to the extent that the liability exceeds our tax attribute carryforwards at this time it is not possible to ascertain whether the potential consummation of the pending fairchild acquisition would be certain to result in a change in judgment with respect to our indefinite reinvestment determination or valuation allowance and assuming such a change in judgment occurred what impact such a change might have on our effective tax rate in the relevant current period or in any future periods 

liquidity and capital resources 

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements offbalance sheet arrangements contingencies sources and uses of cash operations working capital and longterm assets and liabilities 

 

contractual obligations 

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt capital leases operating leases and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2015 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

 

  

    this table also excludes our pension obligations we expect to make cash contributions and future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements of approximately 69 million and 40 million respectively in 2016 this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2016 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations see note 11 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information on our pension obligations 

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 6176 million as of december 31 2015 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months exclusive of capital requirements associated with the fairchild transaction total cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015 include approximately 2407 million available in the united states in addition to cash and cash equivalents already on hand in the united states we have the ability to obtain cash in the united states by settling loans with our foreign subsidiaries in order to cover our domestic needs by utilizing existing credit facilities or through new bank loans or debt obligations 

we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the 

 

united states in various foreign subsidiaries is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements common stock and debt repurchases payments and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current debt agreements or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

in the normal course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us as required for transactions including but not limited to material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases utilities and customs guarantees our senior revolving credit facility includes 150 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit a 02 million letter of credit was outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility as of december 31 2015 we also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our senior revolving credit facility of 50 million at december 31 2015 

as part of securing financing in the normal course of business we issued guarantees related to our capital lease obligations equipment financing lines of credit and real estate mortgages which totaled approximately 1700 million as of december 31 2015 we are also a guarantor of sci llc’s noncollateralized loan with smbc which had a balance of 1982 million as of december 31 2015 see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements 

for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and incur similar expenses totaling 930 million as payments come due we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases letters of credit and guarantee arrangements see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

contingencies 

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses 

 

due to ip infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in economic damages bodily injury or property damage in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims 

we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we expect to incur additional debt obligations to fund the acquisition of fairchild the new obligations are expected to increase leverage and contain covenants and we cannot be certain at this time what the covenants will be 

see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 12 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for possible contingencies related to legal matters see also part i item 1 “business  government regulation” for information on certain environmental matters 

sources and uses of cash 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments research and development to make capital expenditures to repurchase our common stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand we also have the ability to utilize our senior revolving credit facility 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we issued 6900 million of our 100 notes and used a portion of the proceeds to pay down amounts previously drawn on our senior revolving credit facility we also increased the borrowing capacity of our senior revolving credit facility from 8000 million to 10 billion and reset the five year maturity see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

 

as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis on july 15 2015 we completed the purchase of axsem for 80 million in cash consideration plus an additional unlimited contingent consideration with a fair value of 50 million approximately 08 million of cash consideration was held in escrow to secure against certain indemnifiable events in connection with the acquisition of axsem and is included on the company’s consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015 on august 15 2014 we completed the purchase of aptina for a total purchase price of approximately 4054 million in cash of which approximately 29 million remained unpaid and approximately 400 million was held in escrow as of december 31 2014 during the first quarter of 2015 the outstanding amount was paid and during the year ended december 31 2015 212 million of the escrow was released approximately 188 million remained in escrow as of december 31 2015 on april 30 2014 we completed the purchase of truesense for a total purchase price of approximately 957 million in cash see note 4 “acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

on november 18 2015 we entered into the fairchild agreement which provides for a proposed acquisition of fairchild by us the total transaction value is expected to be approximately 24 billion we intend to finance the estimated 24 billion of cash consideration with a combination of cash on hand proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities and new fullycommitted debt financing see part i item 1 “business  recent company mergers and acquisitions” part i item 1a “risk factors” and part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional information see also note 20 “recent developments and subsequent events” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

 

  

 our ability to service our longterm debt including our 100 notes and 2625 notes series b to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating 

 

activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next twelve months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

during the ordinary course of business we evaluate our cash requirements and if necessary adjust our expenditures for inventory operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand during 2015 we paid 2708 million for capital expenditures while in 2014 we paid 2043 million our current minimum commitment for 2016 is approximately 561 million the capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives our capital expenditures have historically been approximately 6 to 7 of annual revenues and we expect to continue to incur capital expenditures to support our business activities future capital expenditures may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted 

on december 1 2014 we announced a capital allocation policy the “capital allocation policy” under which we intend to return to shareholders approximately 80 percent of free cash flow less repayments of longterm debt subject to a variety of factors including our strategic plans market and economic conditions and the board’s discretion for the purposes of the capital allocation policy we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment we also announced the 2014 share repurchase program pursuant to the capital allocation policy under the 2014 share repurchase program we intend to repurchase approximately 10 billion of our common shares over a four year period subject to the same factors and considerations described above the 2014 share repurchase program was effective december 1 2014 and the 300 million 2012 stock repurchase program was terminated on that date see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information with respect to our share repurchase program 

cash management 

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

 

primary cash flow sources 

our longterm cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash our cash flows from operations are summarized as follows in millions 

 

 our cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased by approximately 107 million compared to the year ended december 31 2014 the decrease is primarily attributable to the change in working capital during the period 

our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on among other factors our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets 

our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below 

working capital 

working capital calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs in addition our working capital may be affected by acquisitions capital activities as part of our share 

 

repurchase program and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 346 million as of december 31 2015 and has fluctuated between 339 million and 3158 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters our working capital including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 6522 million as of december 31 2015 and has fluctuated between 6118 million and 9131 million over the last eight quarterends working capital as of december 31 2015 includes the prospective application from the adoption of asu 201517 periods prior to december 31 2015 have not been adjusted for the adoption of asu 201517 see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives for the year ended december 31 2015 our working capital was most significantly impacted by the issuance of the 100 notes the repayment of amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility the repurchase of our common stock and our capital expenditures see note 8 “longterm debt” and note 9 “earnings per share and equity” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

longterm assets and liabilities 

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets and goodwill 

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans generally our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions for additional information see note 11 “employee benefit plans” and note 15 “income taxes” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

key financing and capital events 

overview 

for the past several years we have undertaken various measures to repurchase shares of our common stock reduce interest costs amend existing key financing arrangements and in some cases extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility certain of these measures continued in 2015 set forth below is a summary of certain key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years for further discussion of our debt instruments see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

 

recent events 

on november 18 2015 we entered into the fairchild agreement which provides for a proposed acquisition of fairchild by us the total transaction value is expected to be approximately 24 billion we intend to finance the estimated 24 billion of cash consideration with a combination of cash on hand proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities and new fullycommitted debt financing see part i item 1 “business  recent company mergers and acquisitions” part i item 1a “risk factors” and part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information see also note 20 “recent developments and subsequent events” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

we expect interest expense to increase substantially in future periods starting in the first quarter of 2016 due to the increased amount of debt we expect to incur in connection with the completion of the fairchild transaction as well as related fees that may be associated with the syndication of that debt in advance of closing the transaction

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following i measurement of valuation allowances relating to trade receivables inventories and deferred tax assets ii estimates of future payouts for customer incentives and allowances warranties and restructuring activities iii assumptions surrounding future pension obligations iv fair values of sharebased compensation and of financial instruments including derivative financial instruments v evaluations of uncertain tax positions vi estimates and assumptions used in connection with business combinations and vi future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of goodwill and longlived assets if applicable actual results could differ from these estimates 

 

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue to a much lesser extent from manufacturing and design services provided to customers revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss pass to the customer generally upon shipment the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenues are recorded net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances 

for products sold to distributors who are entitled to allowances generally referred to as “ship and credit rights” within the semiconductor industry we historically have not and do not currently have the ability to reliably estimate the effects of these allowances with distributors at the time of sale of product to the distributors as a result we defer the related revenue and gross margin on sales to these distributors until the ultimate price is known which is when the products have been resold to the end customer or are not eligible for return during the year ended december 31 2015 we amended certain of our distributor agreements which eliminated ship and credit rights providing for circumstances under which we can reliably estimate allowances and recognize revenue upon sale to such distributors although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience our oem customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized and are netted against revenues we review warranty and related claims activities and record provisions as necessary 

freight and handling costs are included in the cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense when incurred taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including value added and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 

see note 2 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information with respect to revenue recognition 

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected enduser demand these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory that is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

i mpairment of longlived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the 

 

timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our asset groups that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value with related gains recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

goodwill  we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows discount and longterm growth rates we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments the assumptions about future conditions include factors such as future revenues gross profits operating expenses and industry trends changes in these estimates based on evolving economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable actual future results may differ from those estimates we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analysis 

the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets associated with that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets associate with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if during this second step we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

we have determined that our product families which are components of our operating segments constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill our product families are one level below the operating segments constituting individual businesses with our segment management conducting regular reviews of the operating results for each product family as of each acquisition date all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the acquired business included in a reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date 

our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of 2016 however identification of a triggering event may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods 

defined benefit pension plans and related benefits  we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our nonus employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs and estimated withdrawal liabilities are determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates for 

 

plan obligations assumed rates of return on pension plan assets and assumed rates of compensation increase for employees participating in the plans these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment and consultation with actuaries considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans as of december 31 2015 a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately 69 million 

contingencies  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 

for a further listing and discussion of our accounting policies see note 2 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under this method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

in determining the amount of the valuation allowance estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies for each taxing jurisdiction are considered if we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 

we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a twostep approach the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement our practice is to recognize interest andor penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made which could have a material impact our effective tax position see note 15 “income taxes” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information see also part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis  results of operations  income tax provision benefit” for additional information

as of december 31 2015 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 13939 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 10069 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 3870 million balance on our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2015 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately 19 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase 

the debt that we expect to incur in connection with the fairchild transaction will bear interest based on floating rate indices or in the event of the issuance of any debt securities at fixed rates to be determined at the time of issuance based on prevailing market conditions 

to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures from an accounting and economic perspective however given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the united states dollar as a normal part of the reporting process our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a nonfunctional currency changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged the notional amount of foreign currency contracts at december 31 2015 and 2014 was 898 million and 1457 million respectively our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies including japanese yen euros malaysian ringgit philippines peso singapore dollars swiss francs chinese renminbi and czech koruna due to the 

 

materiality of our transactions in these local currencies our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the us dollar for example we determined that based on a hypothetical weightedaverage change of 10 in currency exchange rates our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately 611 million for the year ended december 31 2015 assuming no offsetting hedge positions 

see note 14 “financial instruments” of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further information with respect to our hedging activity

company highlights for the year ended december 31 2014 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 recent company mergers and acquisitions 

we have historically pursued strategic acquisitions to leverage our existing capabilities and further build our business on august 15 2014 we completed the purchase of aptina whereby aptina became our whollyowned subsidiary the aggregate purchase price of this transaction was approximately 4054 million in cash subject to customary closing adjustments we believe the acquisition of aptina expands our imagesensor business and establishes on semiconductor as a leader in the fast growing segment of image sensors in the automotive and industrial endmarkets 

on april 30 2014 we completed the purchase of truesense whereby truesense became our whollyowned subsidiary the aggregate purchase price of this transaction was approximately 957 million subject to customary closing adjustments we believe that the acquisition of truesense strengthens our product portfolio targeting industrial endmarkets such as machine vision surveillance and intelligent transportation systems by complementing our existing highspeed highresolution powerefficient image sensing solutions with truesense’s highperformance image sensors for lowlight lownoise 

on january 1 2011 we paid sanyo electric 1421 million in cash and issued a 3775 million note payable to sanyo electric through sci llc in exchange for a 100 interest in sanyo semiconductor and certain other semiconductor related assets held by sanyo electric in the second quarter of 2011 we received approximately 397 million in cash from sanyo electric for working capital and pension adjustments as determined in accordance with the purchase agreement which resulted in a net purchase price of 4799 million 

the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor provided us with a stronger market presence in japan with many leading japanbased customers some of which were previously our customers we believe that this acquisition has provided and will continue to provide us with access to marketleading japanese and asian customers while providing our system solutions group’s customers with access to advanced frontend mixedsignal and analog manufacturing and ultra high volume backend facilities since acquiring sanyo semiconductor in 2011 we have incurred material restructuring expenses to achieve cost savings in order to align the system solutions group’s cost structure with expected revenue levels as the system solutions group experienced revenue and financial performance declines which were greater than our expectations and greater than cyclical declines in our other operating segments these revenue declines were at least partially attributable to the impact from the october 2011 thailand flood a softening of the japanese consumer market and to a lesser extent political tensions between japan and china see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—operating expenses” under the heading “restructuring asset impairments and other net” and in note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information on our system solutions group restructuring activities on a longterm basis we expect our system solutions group to benefit from access to on semiconductor’s market leading customers not previously doing business with sanyo semiconductor in north america europe and china 

on february 27 2011 we acquired 100 of the cmos isbu from cypress semiconductor for 341 million in cash the isbu includes a broad portfolio of highperformance custom and standard image sensors 

  

used in multimegapixel machine vision linear and two dimensional bar code imaging medical xray imaging biometrics digital photography and cinematography and aerospace applications the acquired products include the vita lupa star and ibis families which are all well known throughout the industry 

during 2010 we acquired 100 of sdt and cmd in all cash transactions among other benefits these acquisitions improved our position as a leader of certain technologies expanded our product offerings in certain endmarkets allowed us to reach more customers and enhanced our existing product portfolio

 customers 

in general we have maintained longterm relationships with our key customers sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but typically do not require minimum purchase commitments most of our oem customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year while our other customers including electronic manufacturer service providers and distributors generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of endmarkets including computing automotive electronics consumer electronics industrial electronics wireless communications networking military aerospace and medical for the years ended december 31 2014 december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we had no sales to individual customers including distributors that accounted for 10 or more of our total 

  

consolidated revenues prior to 2012 sales to one of our distributors avnet represented 13 of total consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 revenues for our application products group and standard products group include distributor sales to avnet 

for the year ended december 31 2014 aggregate revenue from our five largest customers by revenue including distributors for our application products group image sensor group standard products group and system solutions group comprised approximately 30  41 44 and 52 of total revenue for each respective operating segment the loss of certain of these customers or distributors may have a material adverse effect on the operations of the respective segment 

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period of two years generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days prior to shipment for custom products without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog” below 

  

endmarkets for our products 

the following table sets forth our principal endmarkets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each endmarket during 2014 sample applications for our products and representative oem customers and endusers 

 

   

oems direct sales to oems accounted for approximately 42 of our revenues in 2014 48 of our revenues in 2013 and 55 of our revenues in 2012 oem customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as continental automotive systems delphi hella panasonic corporation and samsung electronics we focus on three types of oems multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core oem customers the target market customers for our endmarkets are oems that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our oem customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our standard warranty 

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 50 of our revenues in 2014 44 of our revenues in 2013 and 38 of our revenues in 2012 our distributors which include arrow avnet os electronics world peace and wt microelectronics resell to midsized and smaller oems and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to certain distributors are made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with certain of our distributors contain stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns due to current limitations on the feasibility of estimating the up front effect of returns and allowances with these distributors we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to these distributors until these distributors resell the product as a result sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 8 of our revenues in 2014 8 of our revenues in 2013 and 7 of our revenues in 2012 among our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are benchmark electronic celestica flextronics jabil and sanmina  these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for oems originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many oems now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace generally our electronic manufacturing service customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our standard warranty 

see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 18 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for revenues by geographic locations 

manufacturing operations 

we operate frontend wafer site facilities in belgium canada czech republic japan malaysia and the united states and backend assembly and test site facilities in canada china japan malaysia philippines and vietnam in addition to these frontend and backend manufacturing operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 

  

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities along with the approximate gross square footage of each site’s building which includes among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

we operate all of our manufacturing facilities directly with the exception of our assembly and test operations facility located in leshan china which is owned by a joint venture company leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited “leshan” of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is formerly a stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 70 of leshan’s production capacity in 2014 2013 and 2012 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 80 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2015 during the year ended december 31 2014 we acquired an additional equity interest in leshan see note 9 “earnings per share and equity” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information 

we use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including amkor ase hauhong grace umc and lfoundry sr accounted for approximately 30 26 and 23 of our manufacturing costs in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

for information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations see part i item 1a “risk factors” under the heading “trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” included elsewhere in this report 

raw materials 

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers gold copper and lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a justintime basis and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our commitments contingencies and indemnities table in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” under the heading “contractual obligations” included elsewhere in this report from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply increased demand in the industry or certain other factors 

sales marketing and distribution 

as of december 31 2014 our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 1200 professionals servicing customers in approximately 70 countries we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective global applications support from our technical information centers and solution engineering centers allowing for applications which are developed in one region of the world to be instantaneously available throughout all other regions 

patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights 

we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor ® and our on logo and in the united states and internationally we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets employee and nondisclosure agreements and licensing agreements to protect our intellectual property we acquired or were licensed or sublicensed to a significant amount of ip including patents and patent applications in connection with our acquisitions and we have numerous us and foreign patents issued allowed 

  

and pending our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2034 and none of the patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our ip rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents copyrights and other ip rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 

seasonality 

historically our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related endmarkets consisting of a stronger second half of the year for certain endmarkets as compared to the first half of the year we have in the past experienced substantial quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenues and operating results and in the future could continue to experience shortterm periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

backlog 

our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are predominantly booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our electronic data interface customers in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times for those shipments to distributors who are allowed sales return rights and allowances we record revenues on a “sellthrough” basis thus backlog comprised of orders from these distributors will not result in revenues until these distributors sell the products ordered during 2014 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 80 and 85 of actual revenues during such quarter which is consistent with backlog levels in recent prior periods as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases customers tend to order products further in advance and as a result backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 

in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 

we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 

competition 

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for generalpurpose semiconductor products like ours is highly competitive although only a few companies compete with us in most of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fullycustomized ics as well as customers who develop their own ic products see part i item 1a “risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” located elsewhere in this report for additional information 

  

in comparison several competitors noted below are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions the following discusses the effects of competition on our four operating segments 

application products group 

the principal methods of competition in the application products group are with other custom semiconductor vendors based on design experience manufacturing capability depth and quality of ip ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product length of design cycle longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel 

our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables both inside and outside of our control these variables include but are not limited to the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies product performance and quality manufacturing yields and availability customer service pricing industry trends and general economic trends select competitors for certain of our products and solutions include elmos semiconductor ag intersil corporation maxim integrated products inc melexis nv stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments inc 

image sensor group 

the principal method of competition in the image sensor group is to leverage our deep technical knowledge and close customer relationships to drive the most compelling imaging experience for end users the image sensor group has over four decades of ccd imaging experience and was the first to commercialize cmos active pixel sensors as the result the image sensor group was the first to introduce cmos technology into many of our markets including automotive and industrial applications and brings a wealth of technical and enduser applications knowledge to help customers develop innovative imaging solutions across a broad range of enduser needs select competitors for certain of our products and solutions include sony semiconductor samsung omnivision stmicroelectronics nv and toshiba 

standard products group 

the standard products group’s competitive strengths are in our market leading protection and filtering products the breadth of our portfolio technical performance micropackaging expertise our high quality low cost structure and supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers in addition our strengths include our strong ip portfolio and our ability to leverage ip blocks across the company to develop high valueadded assps 

the principal methods of competing in our discrete semiconductor products are through new product and package innovations with enhanced performance over existing products of particular importance are our transient voltage protection and filtering portfolios esd protection and common mode filters power switching and rectification products where we believe we enjoy significant performance advantages over our competition select competitors for certain of our products include diodes incorporated fairchild semiconductor international inc infineon technologies ag kec corporation nxp bv rohm co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv and vishay intertechnology inc 

system solutions group 

the principal methods of competition for the system solutions group are technical performance quality service and price our competitive strengths are strong technology and design capability breadth of product portfolio systems design expertise and longstanding supply relationships with leading oem customers select competitors for certain of our products include fairchild semiconductor international inc infineon 

  

technologies ag mitsubishi electric nxp bv renesas electronics corporation rohm co ltd sanken electric stmicroelectronics nv texas instruments incorporated and toshiba corporation 

research and development 

companysponsored research and development costs in 2014 2013 and 2012 were 3666 million 116 of revenue 3342 million 120 of revenue and 3675 million 127 of revenue respectively we seek to maximize the investment of our people and capital in research and development by targeting innovative products and solutions for high growth applications that position the company to outperform the industry our design expertise in analog digital mixed signal and imaging ics combined with our extensive portfolio of standard products enable the company to offer comprehensive value added solutions to our global customers for their electronics systems 

government regulation 

our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of contamination 

our headquarters in phoenix arizona is located on property that is a “superfund” site a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to cleanup activities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act motorola and now freescale have been actively involved in the cleanup of onsite solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and offsite contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona as part of our separation from motorola in 1999 motorola retained responsibility for this contamination and motorola and freescale have agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter 

our former manufacturing location in aizu japan is located on property where soil and ground water contamination has been detected we believe that the contamination originally occurred during a time when the facility was operated by a prior owner we have been working with local authorities to implement remediation actions and expect all remaining remediation costs to be covered by insurance based on information available any net costs to us in connection with this matter are not expected to be material 

our manufacturing facility in the czech republic has ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that this facility was operated by governmentowned entities the remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located onsite and offsite with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded the government of the czech republic has agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries subject to specified limitations for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination based upon the information available we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 

our design center in east greenwich rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination when we purchased the east greenwich facility we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property based on the information available we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

as a result of the acquisition of amis in 2008 we are a “primary responsible party” to an environmental remediation and cleanup at amis’s former corporate headquarters in santa clara california costs incurred by amis include implementation of the cleanup plan operations and maintenance of remediation systems and 

  

other project management costs however amis’s former parent company a subsidiary of nippon mining contractually agreed to indemnify amis and us for any obligations relating to environmental remediation and cleanup at this location based on the information available we do not believe that any future costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and liability for currently known environmental conditions to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects it is possible however that future developments including changes in laws and regulations government policies customer specification personnel and physical property conditions including currently undiscovered contamination could lead to material costs see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for information on certain environmental matters 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 24500 employees worldwide of which approximately 3100 employees were in the united states none of our employees in the united states are covered by collective bargaining agreements certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements eg those in japan and belgium or similar arrangements or are represented by workers councils for information regarding employee risk associated with our international operations see part i item 1a “risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” elsewhere in this report of the total number of our employees as of december 31 2014 approximately 20400 were engaged in manufacturing approximately 1200 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization which includes customer service approximately 800 were engaged in administration and approximately 2100 were engaged in research and development

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

from time to time we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and incur additional operating losses in the future 

at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses reduced enduser demand price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity the effects of natural disasters such as the flooding in thailand or the japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011 and other factors have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns and upturns 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and as a result is subject to significant downturns and upturns the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices in the event of such a downturn our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges on the other hand significant upturns have led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in the event of such an upturn we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected we may also not be able to balance our expansion activities and actual demand in such an environment the overbuilding of capacity and excess increases of inventory by us and other companies can result in overcapacity in the industry and general price erosion 

we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience them in the future we cannot accurately predict the timing of the current and future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these conditions might be these future conditions in the semiconductor industry could adversely impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic conditions including those related to the credit markets may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

adverse global economic conditions may result in fluctuations and reductions in consumer and commercial spending from time to time and such conditions or uncertainties about such conditions may result in lower orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the 

  

semiconductor industry has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions volatility in global economic conditions including the level of the economic recovery in the united states the growth rate of the chinese economy the effect of conditions in japan including a weakened demand environment and yen and economic weakness in many other countries and regions volatility in oil prices and conflicts in eastern europe and the middle east may adversely and materially affect our industry business and results of operations and we cannot accurately predict volatility or how severe and prolonged any downturn or recovery might be reduced spending has in the past driven us and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which results in a negative effect on gross profit in addition to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected our business and results of operations could be adversely and materially affected moreover volatility in revenues as a result of unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our shortterm and longterm strategies 

furthermore the united states and global credit markets could experience renewed financial turmoil if the past pressures on credit were renewed or we experience an additional global downturn we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all and we may not be able to refinance if necessary any outstanding debt when due all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity on terms acceptable to us to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures for the immediate future if our operating results falter and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition global financial uncertainty affecting the financial and other markets could impact our business in a number of other ways including causing 1 our customers and consumers in general to defer purchases 2 our customers difficulties in obtaining sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us 3 our key suppliers to become capacityconstrained or insolvent resulting in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and 4 our key suppliers to require acceleration of payments to them or our customers to delay payments to us any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses incurring additional debt assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 

in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other factors efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts we face risks resulting from the expansion of our operations through acquisitions including but not limited to 1 the difficulty of integrating aligning and coordinating organizations which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures 2 risks of entering new semiconductor markets or regions of the world in which we have limited experience 3 risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies 4 the risk that our due diligence in the acquisition process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities that are in existence at the time of our acquisitions 5 the risk that our existing or prospective customers or customers of the acquired business may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions as we integrate new businesses and companies into our business or that they may seek to change their existing business relationships 6 challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions including difficulties in entering into new market segments in which we are not experienced 7 the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets 8 difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses 9 the diversion of management’s attention from the daily operations of existing businesses and 10 negative pressure on gross margins resulting from increased operating and restructuring costs 

  

the integration of newly acquired businesses will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships moreover even if we were able to fully integrate a new acquisition’s business operations and other assets successfully there can be no assurance that such integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible or were anticipated from the acquisition or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time delays in integrating our acquisitions which could be caused by factors outside of our control could adversely affect the intended benefits of the acquisitions to our business financial results financial condition and stock price 

in addition current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us and as a result we could lose key employees these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel in connection with a transaction key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in the form of changeincontrol agreements acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equitybased compensation rights these amounts could impact their willingness to continue to work for us further as a result of our acquisitions we may assume liabilities from the target’s current employee benefit plans that may require us to bring plan documentation into compliance with current law including ensuring that plans are adequately funded 

in connection with our acquisition activity we are required by generally accepted accounting principles and sec rules and regulations to integrate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or if they do have independent audited financial statements such statements may not be prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems which could materially impair our ability to obtain or prepare necessary financial information concerning such businesses in a format required to allow proper integration with our systems and financial statements in addition immediately after an acquisition and until such time as we are able to fully integrate an acquired business into our financial statements we may be dependent on the acquired business’ financial controls and systems for reporting and other financial information including projections and goals for such acquired business we may not be able to successfully prepare and file required financial statements or other financial information for the acquired business or to integrate the acquired business into our financial controls and systems and our consolidated financial statements in a timely manner failure to prepare accurate financial reports for our acquired businesses in a timely manner in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could cause material inaccuracies in our financial statements and sec filings which could result in the necessity to restate our financials or lead to unknown liabilities and possibly result in a material impact on our stock price 

in connection with an acquisition it is possible that we may anticipate tax savings through integration of the newly acquired business into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure as with any estimate it is possible that the estimates of the potential savings could turn out to be incorrect 

we review goodwill associated with our acquisitions for impairment at least on an annual basis see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” note 2 “significant accounting policies—goodwill” and note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our consolidated audited financial statements located elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information about goodwill in the past we have recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions factors we consider important that could result in a subsequent impairment to goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends we may have further material goodwill impairments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results in any such case it is possible that factors outside of our control including but not limited to increases in interest rates and loss of key customers could adversely affect the intended benefits from an acquisition even though we would continue to have a repayment obligation under the related loan agreement 

our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization and realizing expected synergies from acquisitions 

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing for instance if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits 

moreover we believe that we will need to continue to improve the margin levels of our system solutions group business and successfully execute on available opportunities in order to realize the intended benefits of this transaction while we anticipate that certain cost reduction measures taken including voluntary retirement programs implemented in 2013 and 2014 should improve its margin levels we may not be able to benefit fully from such actions 

the failure to successfully implement profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions including restructuring activities could adversely affect our business 

from time to time we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to among other factors significant downturns in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs have been primarily composed of employee separation costs and asset impairments see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on restructuring activities 

we also often undertake restructuring activities in connection with our business acquisitions which can result in significant charges including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges 

we cannot assure you that our restructuring plans and cost reduction initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition 

for additional information regarding our profitability enhancement programs and cost reduction measures see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 continue to aggressively manage maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 further expand our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 rationalize our manufacturing operations 7 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 8 reduce selling and administrative expenses 9 manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands 10 actively manage working capital 11 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 12 integrate newly acquired products manufacturing capabilities and sales channels we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other factors to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our ip portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these factors and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities the impact of natural disasters and cyber attacks increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process and often requires significant capital investment additionally expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured there can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes known as “design wins” for new products new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products including any delays in establishing sufficient manufacturing capacity could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue in addition design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or that we will generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers including changes due to evolving consumer preferences international political developments influencing enduser preferences and natural disasters or other extraordinary events that impact our customers or endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive there is no assurance that the products we develop and market will be well received by customers that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop new products that a significant investment in new products will be profitable or that we will have margins as high as we anticipate at the time of investment or have experienced historically further a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

uncertainties involving the timing and amount of orders and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days for custom products without incurring a significant penalty we routinely generate inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends although only a few companies compete with us in most of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fully customized ics as well as from customers who develop their own ic products in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future in different product lines we compete to varying degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers tablets industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods any inability to maintain revenues or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and on our business and prospects as a whole 

the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidation that could adversely affect our competitiveness many of our competitors particularly larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

  

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other conditions and events capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities including as a part of our cost reduction measures and in reaction to manmade and natural disasters such as the 2011 flooding in thailand upgrading or expanding existing facilities changing our process technologies or uncertainty as a result of the acquisition and integration of manufacturing facilities acquired as a result of our acquisition activities any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing information technology and equipment to remain competitive and any failure inadequacy or delayed implementation could harm our ability to effectively operate our business such capital expenditures and commitments as well as other commitments may materially decrease our liquidity 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices our manufacturing assembly and test facilities have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume however there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and utilize these new technologies there also is no assurance that the new technologies we do develop and utilize will be sufficient to support our business operations and strategies or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such new technologies 

we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency any such implementation however can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or in some instances to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned in the case of abandonment we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

in the recent past we have undertaken various and material cost reduction measures which we believe have been largely successful however these reductions and any future reductions may unintentionally affect our ability to remain competitive in efficiency and productivity ultimately we may be forced to increase our future capital expenditures in unexpected ways to meet our operational needs in among other areas manufacturing information technology and equipment we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make timely and necessary investments in the areas discussed above or other areas we have not identified 

  

we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and other business disruptions 

our worldwide operations are subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions from time to time which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial reporting and condition we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods hurricanes typhoons droughts and other extreme weather conditions earthquakes tsunamis volcanoes and similar natural disasters as well as power outages power shortages telecommunications failures industrial accidents and similar events such events can cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property including our books and financial and corporate records and data and related internal controls and can also have significant direct and indirect consequences for example such events can negatively impact revenues and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event such costs may include expenses to restore production or to move production to other facilities including incremental capital expenditures and costs for expedited shipping expenses incurred with a shutdown of the damaged facility including employee severance payments and other unusual costs and expenses such as fixed asset impairments inventory writedowns charges relating to cancellation of purchase orders for excess materials and charges for restoration and recovery work overall costs may also be impacted by other factors such as the underabsorption of our manufacturing and operating support overhead for example in the case of our facility in roznov czech republic that manufactures silicon wafers used by a number of our facilities any natural or manmade disaster operational disruption or other extraordinary event that impacted the facility or regional infrastructure would have a substantial adverse effect on our ability to produce a number of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business revenues costs andor prospects if we were unable to effectively source silicon wafers on acceptable terms from qualified third parties to replace the production loss such events may also affect the infrastructure of the country in which the event occurs causing water damage power outages and rolling blackouts transportation delays and restrictions public health issues and economic instability and disrupting local and international supply chains as a result we could experience shortages of and interruptions in supply and increased prices for components that we source from companies located in or with operations in any such country as well as from other suppliers whose supply chains may similarly be affected such shortages and interruptions may also affect our ability to communicate with our customers and suppliers and to timely deliver our products to customers and as a result our customers may seek substitute products from other manufacturers in addition damage or destruction to our books and financial and corporate records and data could adversely affect our ability to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the historical and future reporting of our financial results and our ability to integrate the financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies responding to natural disasters and their consequences will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above such insurance may be subject to deductible and coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not turn to other suppliers significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner the costs of our raw materials increase significantly their quality deteriorates or the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including polysilicon silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

in addition for some of our products we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt production in material ways in addition we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect in any such case arranging for replacement contractors can be time consuming and costly and we may encounter startup difficulties 

regulations that impose disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in our products will result in additional cost and expense and could result in other significant adverse effects 

rules adopted by the sec implementing the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in our products compliance with these rules will result in additional cost and expense including for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities these rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our semiconductor devices as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals or components that can be used in our products there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such metals or components in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices the cost of compliance to our service providers foundries subcontractors and suppliers could also be passed along to us resulting in higher prices for the materials or components we use in our products also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the metals used in our products we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

  

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the asiapacific region the americas and europe and we maintain significant operations in these regions in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the past we have benefited from relatively low effective tax rates because most of our income has been earned and reinvested in jurisdictions outside the us our effective tax rate is uncertain on an ongoing basis changes to income tax regulations in the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could under our existing tax structure significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operations and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition business combinations and investment transactions changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes and changes in available tax credits could increase our future effective tax rate changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by our increasing or decreasing operations in jurisdictions with higher or lower rates as well as by changes in rates or the laws that determine when we are subject to taxation in a specific jurisdiction 

we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in 

  

the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt repurchases payments acquisitions and stock repurchases if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations through borrowings under our current debt agreements or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

other activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange for instance while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

our success both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled design technical managerial marketing and financial personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive in addition from time to time we have announced certain cost reductions that included the freezing of salaries and elimination of bonuses mandatory unpaid time off factory shutdowns and reduction in personnel we also establish performance criteria for awards to officers and employees under bonus and other incentive plans and programs that may not be satisfied these measures as well as any future measures could negatively affect morale and lead to unintended employee attrition at all levels of our organization moreover we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel and our existing employment agreements do not require the employee to continue to work for us 

as employee incentives we have issued common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time rsus with timebased vesting and performancebased awards any difficulty relating to obtaining stockholder approval of new or amendments to equity compensation plans could limit our ability to issue these types of awards our stock price at times has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of certain of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered ip assets patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies these laws and regulations are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts additionally some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications with respect to our ip generally we cannot assure you that 

 

  

  

  

   

in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective ip protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty ip rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such ip rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for ip we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

we also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to ip arising out of our research 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

our ability to enforce our patents trademarks copyrights software licenses and other ip is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged ip rights 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

all industries including the semiconductor industry are subject to legal claims including securities litigation litigation in connection with acquisitions and litigation over executive compensation and disclosure of executive compensation the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future in addition we can 

  

provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions and executive compensation will not subject us to additional litigation this sort of litigation can be particularly costly and may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general we are involved in a variety of legal matters most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers employment and labor and ip we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however defense and settlement costs can be substantial even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows further uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for more information on our legal proceedings 

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards 

like most publicly traded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm as we continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future 

there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future failure to comply with sox including delaying or failing to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such transactions and the trading price of our common stock may decline in addition if we fail to remedy any material weakness our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements our financial statements may be materially inaccurate our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other requirements regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operation of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization and spinout from motorola we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities 

  

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

 

  

  

  

  

 warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process requiring production in a tightly controlled clean environment minute impurities in our manufacturing materials contaminants in the manufacturing environment manufacturing equipment failures and other defects can cause our products to be noncompliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design oems are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage if any and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved in certain instances we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective 

new legal requirements particularly with respect to health care reform could increase the cost of our employee benefits and adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations 

we incur significant costs to maintain competitive employee benefits to attract and retain our highly skilled personnel changes to the regulatory environment with respect to these benefits could adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations in particular the health care reform legislation enacted by the us congress is intended to result in significant changes to the us health care system this legislation may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of the new healthcare regulations and may impair our ability to provide the same level of coverage 

  

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could damage our reputation and harm our business and operating results 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses illegal hacking or acts of vandalism or terrorism additionally the proprietary sensitive or confidential information we manage and store may be subject to accidental loss misuse inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination our security measures andor those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches in some cases we may initially be unaware of an incident or its magnitude or effects the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we also provide certain confidential and proprietary information to our third party service providers and other business partners and the systems of these third parties could be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromised any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business cause an interruption in our operations result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data result in a violation of privacy or other laws expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation which could harm our business and operating results 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

despite the fact that we have recently retired some debt with existing cash flow we have substantial debt service obligations in addition we incurred debt to acquire aptina and may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments from time to time the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness from time to time may limit us and our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next 12 months if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities moreover the debt we may incur from time to time may require collateral to secure such indebtedness which would place our assets at risk as well as limit our flexibility related to such assets ultimately we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all and we may need to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

our debt agreements from time to time may contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other decisions we might make our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which could cross default other indebtedness we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements from time to time may contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to then current stockholders 

conversion of convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders including holders who had previously converted their convertible notes or may otherwise depress the price of our stock 

under the terms of the 2625 notes series b any conversions of the 2625 notes series b will be settled in cash up to the par value of the notes being converted with the excess of the conversion value over the par value being settled in shares of common stock subject to our ability to settle the entire amount in cash it is our current intent to settle the per value in cash generally speaking this would result in the issuance of common stock upon the conversion of the 2625 notes series b only if our common stock is trading at a value in excess of 1050 per share and we do not elect to pay the entire amount in cash or are unable to do so the conversion of some or all of the 2625 notes series b into common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and may impact the value of our common stock the 2625 notes series b will become fully convertible on june 15 2016 prior to that date the 2625 notes series b will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary events see note 8 “long term debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information the dilutive effect of the 2625 notes series b on the calculation of our earnings per share is described in note 9 “earnings per share and equity” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may impact the value of our common stock a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter in addition to the other factors described above factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors among others some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had significant variance and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

 

 authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock which is preferred stock that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval and that could be issued with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and 

 

   

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

our common stock is traded under the symbol “onnn” on the nasdaq global select market the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock for the fiscal periods indicated as reported by the nasdaq global select market 

 

 as of february 20 2015 there were approximately 256 holders of record of our common stock and 431315129 shares of common stock outstanding 

we have neither declared nor paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our initial public offering our future dividend policy with respect to our common stock will depend upon our earnings capital requirements financial condition debt restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by tax considerations as described in note 15 “income taxes” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

our senior revolving credit facility permits us to pay cash dividends to our common stockholders if after giving effect thereto the senior leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the credit agreement does not exceed 275 to 100 as of december 31 2014 we were within the required senior leverage ratio and therefore permitted to pay cash dividends under our senior revolving credit facility see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion of our revolving credit facility

industry overview 

according to wsts an industry research firm worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 3358 billion in 2014 an increase of approximately 99 from 3056 billion in 2013 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our serviceable addressable market “sam” since 2010 

 

  

  

 worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew 318 in 2010 grew 04 in 2011 declined 26 in 2012 grew 48 in 2013 and grew 99 in 2014 following a pattern associated with the financial crisis subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty the increase of 99 from 2013 to 2014 is related to improved global macroeconomic conditions within the semiconductor industry affecting sales in all geographic regions  

  

sales in our sam increased to 1102 billion in 2010 decreased to 1074 billion in 2011 decreased to 1037 billion in 2012 increased to 1043 billion in 2013 and increased to 112 billion in 2014 the increase of approximately 74 from 1043 billion in 2013 to 112 billion in 2014 is consistent with the trend in the worldwide semiconductor market the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our sam of approximately 3 for the next three years these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 

recent results 

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 were 31618 million an increase of approximately 14 from 27827 million for the year ended december 31 2013 the majority of the increase was attributable to our acquisitions of aptina and truesense along with other increases in our application products group and standard products group partially offset by decreased revenue from our system solutions group  during 2014 we reported net income attributable to on semiconductor corporation of 1897 million compared to net income attributable to on semiconductor corporation of 1504 million in 2013 our gross margin increased by approximately 90 basis points to 343 in 2014 from 334 in 2013 primarily driven by changes in volume and mix across certain of our product lines 

during 2014 the majority of our restructuring and cost saving initiatives were focused on our system solutions group which included certain voluntary retirement programs and the planned closure of our kss facility 

for further information with respect to our restructuring activity including our other restructuring and cost savings programs initiated during 2014 see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have reduced or shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have caused demand to strengthen production volumes have historically stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand reaches levels above capacity production capabilities shortages begin to occur which typically causes pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

business and macroeconomic environment influence on cost savings and restructuring activities 

we have recognized efficiencies from implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure however the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions while there have been recent indications of improving conditions our business environment continues to experience significant uncertainty and volatility we have historically reviewed and will continue to review our cost structure capital investments and other expenditures to align our spending and capacity with our current sales and manufacturing projections 

we have historically taken significant actions to align our overall cost structure with our expected revenue levels such actions continued in 2014 within our system solutions group see “results of operations” under the heading “restructuring asset impairments and other net” below along with note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details relating to our most recent cost saving actions 

outlook 

on semiconductor q1 2015 outlook 

based upon product booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we estimate that our revenues will be approximately 840 million to 880 million in the first quarter of 2015 backlog levels for the first quarter of 2015 represent approximately 80 to 85 of our anticipated first quarter 2015 revenues we estimate average selling prices for the first quarter of 2015 will be down approximately two percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 for the first quarter of 2015 we estimate that gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be approximately 334 to 354 

results of operations 

our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2014 include the operations of our acquisitions of aptina and truesense on august 15 2014 and april 30 2014 respectively 

revision of previouslyissued financial statements 

during the quarter ended december 31 2014 we revised our financial statements for 2013 and 2012 to record a deferred tax asset in a foreign subsidiary and have made adjustments in each successive period related to the foreign currency exchange rate changes associated with that item the prior periods also include revised amounts from a change in application of an accounting convention related to manufacturing variances and other adjustments relating to hedging and inventory amounts these other previouslyidentified errors were either uncorrected or corrected in a period subsequent to the period in which the error originated 

  

we assessed the effect of the above errors in the aggregate on prior periods’ financial statements in accordance with the sec’s staff accounting bulletins no 99 and 108 and based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors determined that the errors were not material to any of our prior interim and annual financial statements 

all financial information contained herein has been revised to reflect the correction of these errors see note 1 “background and basis of presentation” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information 

operating results 

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 in millions 

 

   

revenues 

revenues were 31618 million 27827 million and 28949 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase from 2013 to 2014 was primarily attributed to approximately 2624 million of additional revenue in the image sensor group provided by the acquisitions of aptina and truesense along with increases from our application products group and standard products group which experienced greater revenue as a result of an improved demand environment the increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased revenue from our system solutions group 

for the year ended december 31 2014 we experienced a decline in average selling prices of approximately 5 as compared to 2013 offset by favorable changes in volume and mix which resulted in a net increase in revenue of approximately 14 

the decrease in revenues from 2012 to 2013 was the result of decreased revenue in our system solutions group from a weakened demand environment associated with a further softening of the japanese consumer market and a devalued yen which was partially offset by increased revenue from our other reportable segments 

revenues by reportable segment for each of the three years below were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

 revenues from the application products group 

revenues from the application products group increased by 736 million or approximately 7 from 2013 to 2014 and increased from 2012 to 2013 by 272 million or approximately 3 

the 2014 increase resulted from an increase in revenues from asic products of 444 million or approximately 9 an increase in revenues from analog products of 132 million or approximately 3 an increase in revenues from foundry services of 88 million or approximately 65 and an increase in revenues from tmos products of 78 million or approximately 20 

the 2013 increase resulted from an increase in revenues from analog products of 299 million or approximately 8 and an increase in revenue from tmos products of 50 million or approximately 15 partially offset by a decrease in revenues from asic products of 104 million or approximately 2 and a decrease in revenues from ecl products of 69 million or approximately 15 

revenues from the image sensor group 

revenues from the image sensor group increased by 2666 million from 2013 to 2014 and decreased from 2012 to 2013 by 101 million 

this increase in 2014 is primarily attributable to revenue provided by the 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense which generated approximately 2624 million of revenue during 2014 revenues from our existing image sensor business units also increased during 2014 

  

revenues from the standard products group 

revenues from the standard products group increased by 892 million or approximately 8 from 2013 to 2014 and increased from 2012 to 2013 by 165 million or approximately 1 

the 2014 increase resulted from an increase in revenues from discrete products of 604 million or approximately 14 an increase in revenues from analog products of 241 million or approximately 8 and an increase in revenues from memory products of 113 million or approximately 20 partially offset by a decrease in revenues from tmos products 

the 2013 increase resulted from an increase in revenues from discrete products of 249 million or approximately 6 and an increase in revenues from analog products of 89 million or approximately 3 partially offset by a decrease in revenues from tmos products of 138 million or approximately 6 

revenues from the system solutions group 

revenues from the system solutions group decreased by 503 million or approximately 8 from 2013 to 2014 and decreased from 2012 to 2013 by 1458 million or approximately 19 

the 2014 decrease resulted from a decrease in demand from the japanese consumer market and an increase in competition in other regions causing a decrease in revenue from lsi products of approximately 538 million or approximately 130 

the 2013 decrease resulted from a softening of the japanese consumer market a devalued yen and to a lesser extent political tensions between japan and china 

revenues by geographic location 

revenues by geographic location including local sales made by operations within each area based on sales billed from the respective country are summarized as follows in millions 

 

  

 for additional information see the table of revenues by geographic location included in note 18 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

gross profit and gross margin exclusive of amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets described below 

our gross profit by reportable segment in each of the three years below was as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

  

 our gross profit was 10849 million 9291 million and 9463 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the gross profit increase of 1558 million or approximately 17 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to increased revenues along with increased capacity utilization and cost savings realized from previous restructuring activities partially offset by decreased average selling prices and approximately 270 million for the expensing of the fair market value of inventory stepup from our recent acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2014 

the gross profit decrease from 2012 to 2013 is primarily attributable to decreases in gross profit in our system solution group as a result of lower revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 as well as smaller decreases in gross profit from our other operating segments 

gross margin increased to approximately 343 during 2014 compared to approximately 334 during 2013 this increase was primarily driven by favorable changes in volume and mix across certain product lines as well as a larger proportion of revenues generated from our applications products group image sensor group and standard products group which experienced higher gross margin levels than our system solutions group 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues from 2012 to 2013 was primarily driven by changes in volume and mix across certain product lines 

operating expenses 

research and development 

research and development expenses were 3666 million 3342 million and 3675 million representing approximately 116 120 and 127 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the increase in research and development expenses of 324 million or approximately 10 from 2013 to 2014 is primarily associated with approximately 380 million of expenses attributable to our 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense these expenses were further increased by greater personnel costs in our application products group and standard products group along with increased performancebased compensation as a result of improved performance results for 2014 compared to 2013 partially offset by decreases in our system solutions group attributable to decreased payroll related expenses resulting from our restructuring and cost saving activities 

  

the decrease in research and development expenses from 2012 to 2013 was primarily associated with decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group along with the impact of a devalued yen 

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expenses were 2000 million 1712 million and 1809 million representing approximately 63 62 and 62 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the increase in selling and marketing expenses of 288 million or approximately 17 from 2013 to 2014 is primarily associated with approximately 112 million of expenses attributable to our 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense along with increased sales commissions and increased payroll related expenses associated with performancebased compensation as a result of improved performance results for 2014 compared to 2013 

the decrease in selling and marketing expenses from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group along with the impact of a devalued yen 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses were 1809 million 1485 million and 1606 million representing approximately 57 53 and 55 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the increase in general and administrative expenses of 324 million or approximatively 22 from 2013 to 2014 is primarily associated with approximately 96 million of expenses attributable to our 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense along with increased payroll related expenses associated with performancebased compensation as a result of improved performance results for 2014 compared to 2013 in addition to approximately 81 million in thirdparty acquisitionrelated expenses 

the decrease in general and administrative expenses from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group along with the impact of a devalued yen 

amortization of acquisition—related intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 684 million 331 million and 444 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase of 353 million from 2013 to 2014 is attributable to the amortization of intangible assets assumed as a result of our acquisitions of aptina and truesense see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

the decrease in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributed to the impairment of certain of the system solutions group’s intangible assets recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

restructuring asset impairments and other net 

restructuring asset impairments and other net was 305 million 332 million and 1637 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the information below summarizes the major 

  

activities in each year for additional information see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we initiated a voluntary retirement program for employees of certain of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan the “q4 2013 voluntary retirement program” approximately 350 employees opted to retire under the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program of which all employees had exited by december 31 2014 for the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized approximately 104 million of employee separation charges related to the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program 

in connection with the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program approximately 70 contractor positions were also identified for elimination all of which all had exited by the end of 2014 during the year ended december 31 2014 an additional 40 positions were identified for elimination as an extension of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program consisting of 20 employees and 20 contractors substantially all of which had exited by december 31 2014 

as a result of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program we recognized a pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees of 45 million during the year ended december 31 2014 which is recorded in restructuring asset impairments and other net see note 11 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we initiated further voluntary retirement activities applicable to an additional 60 to 70 positions for certain of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan consisting of employees and contractors substantially all personnel had exited under this program by december 31 2014 we anticipate total cost savings for the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program which includes the above headcounts to be between the range of our previously disclosed expectations of 36 million to 45 million during the first year following the completion of the anticipated headcount reductions 

on october 6 2013 we announced a plan to close kss the “kss plan” pursuant to the kss plan a majority of the production from kss was transferred to other of our manufacturing facilities the kss plan includes the elimination of approximately 170 full time and 40 contract employees during the year ended december 31 2014 we recorded approximately 78 million of employee separation charges and 23 million of exit costs related to the kss plan 

as a result of the kss facility closure we recognized a 21 million pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees during the year ended december 31 2014 which is recorded in restructuring asset impairments and other net see note 11 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we initiated two voluntary retirement programs for certain employees of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan approximately 500 employees opted to retire pursuant to the first program and substantially all employees had retired by december 31 2013 approximately 170 employees had retired by december 31 2013 under the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program as part of these restructuring activities approximately half of the 70 contractor positions identified for elimination were terminated by the end of 2013 

we recorded net charges of approximately 373 million in connection with these programs consisting of employee severance charges of 529 million partially offset by pension and related retirement liability adjustments associated with the affected employees which resulted in a pension curtailment benefit of 156 million 

  

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded 31 million of restructuring charges related to the announced closure of our aizu facility we also released approximately 210 million of associated cumulative foreign currency translation gains related to our subsidiary that owned the aizu facility which utilized the japanese yen as its functional currency the related amount was recorded as a benefit to restructuring asset impairments and other net on the our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for additional information see note 16 “changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

we recorded approximately 100 million of net restructuring charges related to the kss plan during the year ended december 31 2013 consisting of employee severance charges of 65 million and 35 million of asset impairment charges associated with the kss plan 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we initiated a voluntary retirement program for certain employees of our system solutions group and certain of its subsidiaries we recorded net charges of approximately 359 million associated with this program consisting of employee severance charges of 476 million partially offset by 117 million attributed to pension plan curtailment gains 

additionally during the year ended december 31 2012 we executed a global workforce reduction program restructuring expenses resulting from this program consisted primarily of 112 million associated with employee severance charges 

we incurred additional charges related to the closure of certain of our facilities during 2012 

indefinite and longlived asset impairment charges 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we determined that approximately 87 million in carrying value of goodwill relating to one of our reporting units in the application products group was impaired resulting from a decline in estimated future cash flows in connection with this impairment we wroteoff approximately 09 million of intangible assets and 47 million of other longlived assets see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we evaluated the current period operating results of the system solutions group and reassessed future projections for the segment as a result we determined that 944 million of carrying value for certain longlived assets associated with the system solutions group and 316 million of related intangible assets were impaired for additional information see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we further determined that approximately 141 million in carrying value of goodwill relating to our 2008 acquisition of catalyst was impaired resulting from a strategic decision to invest in other business units and the resulting decline in estimated future cash flows as part of our annual goodwill testing it was determined that certain intangible assets associated with the standard products group were impaired in connection with this impairment we wroteoff approximately 38 million of intangible assets these goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were recognized in our standard products group segment see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

  

other income and expenses 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased by 45 million from 386 million in 2013 to 341 million in 2014 additionally interest expense decreased by 175 million from 561 million in 2012 to 386 million in 2013 we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of 70 million 112 million and 234 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our average longterm debt balance including current maturities and net of debt discount during 2014 2013 and 2012 was 10674 million 9771 million and 11095 million respectively our weighted average interest rate on longterm debt including current maturities and net of debt discount was approximately 32 39 and 51 per annum in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources—key financing and capital events” below for a description of our refinancing activities 

other 

other income decreased by 59 million from a gain of 15 million in 2013 to a loss of 44 million in 2014 other income decreased by 43 million from a gain of 58 million in 2012 to a gain of 15 million in 2013 the change from year to year is largely attributable to fluctuations in foreign currencies against the dollar for the periods presented net of the impact from our hedging activity 

loss on debt extinguishment 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we exchanged 600 million in principal value 574 million of carrying value of our 2625 notes for 585 million in principal value of our 2625 notes series b plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2625 notes resulting in a loss on debt repurchase of 31 million subject to certain other terms and conditions this transaction extended the earliest put date for the exchanged amount from december 2013 to december 2016 

see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we exchanged 999 million in par value 928 million of carrying value of our 2625 notes for 999 million in par value of 2625 notes series b and 20 million in cash which resulted in a loss on debt exchange of 78 million subject to certain other terms and conditions this exchange extended the first put date of the underlying notes which we consider to be the earliest maturity date from december 2013 to december 2016 see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded an income tax benefit of 02 million and a provision of 164 million and 160 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2014 consisted of the reversal of 233 million of our previously established valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets as a result of a net deferred tax liability recorded as part of the truesense acquisition and the reversal of 46 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions that were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during the year ended december 31 2014 this is partially offset by 198 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations 46 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions and 33 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill 

  

the 2013 provision of 164 million included 222 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 09 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions and 27 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill this is partially offset by the reversal of 60 million of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and the reversal of 34 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2013 

the 2012 provision of 160 million included 217 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations 26 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill and 09 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions this is partially offset by 78 million of additional tax benefit recorded and the reversal of 14 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2012 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014 was a benefit of 01 which differs from the us statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries our effective tax rate was also lower than the us statutory federal income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 and december 31 2012  due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our domestic and japan related deferred tax assets however it is reasonably possible that a substantial portion of the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets will be reversed within one year of december 31 2014 which is not expected to have a material effect on the company’s cash taxes as of december 31 2014 the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets was approximately 4619 million 

income taxes have not been provided on approximately 17841 million of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2014 over which we have sufficient influence to control the distribution of such earnings and have determined that substantially all such earnings have been reinvested indefinitely these earnings could become subject to either or both federal income tax and foreign withholding tax if they are remitted as dividends if foreign earnings are loaned to any of our domestic companies or if we sell our investment in certain subsidiaries we estimate that repatriation of these foreign earnings would generate additional taxes of approximately 1787 million after the assumed utilization of our available net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits

liquidity and capital resources 

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements offbalance sheet arrangements contingencies sources and uses of cash operations working capital and longterm assets and liabilities 

  

contractual obligations 

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt capital leases operating leases and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2014 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

 

  

  

  

 this table also excludes our pension obligations we expect to make cash contributions and future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements of approximately 85 million in 2015 this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2015 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations see note 11 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information on our pension obligations 

our balance of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 5178 million at december 31 2014 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months total cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at december 31 2014 include approximately 2036 million available in the united states in addition to cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments already on hand in the united states we have the ability to obtain cash in the united states by settling loans with our foreign subsidiaries in order to cover our domestic needs by utilizing existing credit facilities or through new bank loans or debt obligations 

we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements common stock and debt repurchases payments and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current debt agreements or other sources of cash obtained 

  

at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition

see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” included elsewhere in this report for a discussion of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and our stock repurchase activities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

in the normal course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us as required for transactions including but not limited to material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases utilities and customs guarantees our senior revolving credit facility includes 400 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit a 02 million letter of credit was outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility as of december 31 2014 we also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our senior revolving credit facility of 63 million at december 31 2014 

as part of securing financing in the normal course of business we issued guarantees related to our capital lease obligations equipment financing lines of credit and real estate mortgages which totaled approximately 1133 million as of december 31 2014 we are also a guarantor of sci llc’s noncollateralized loan with smbc which had a balance of 2359 million as of december 31 2014 see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements 

for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and incur similar expenses totaling 1036 million as payments come due we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases letters of credit and guarantee arrangements see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

contingencies 

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to ip infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in economic damages bodily injury or property damage in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be 

  

required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims 

we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 12 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for possible contingencies related to legal matters see also part i item 1 “business—government regulation” for information on certain environmental matters 

sources and uses of cash 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures for strategic acquisitions and investments to repurchase our common stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand including shortterm investments 

as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis on august 15 2014 we completed the purchase of aptina for a total purchase price of approximately 4054 million in cash of which approximately 29 million remained unpaid and approximately 400 million was held in escrow as of december 31 2014 on april 30 2014 we completed the purchase of truesense for a total purchase price of approximately 957 million in cash see note 4 “acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

 

  

   

our ability to service our longterm debt including our 2625 notes series b to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next twelve months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

during the ordinary course of business we evaluate our cash requirements and if necessary adjust our expenditures for inventory operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand during 2014 we paid 2043 million for capital expenditures while in 2013 we paid 1552 million our current projection for capital expenditures in 2015 is approximately 250 million to 270 million of which our current minimum commitment is approximately 385 million the capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives 

on october 10 2013 we entered into an 8000 million fiveyear senior revolving credit facility the new credit agreement amended and restated our prior agreement dated as of december 23 2011 and significantly increased our liquidity as described under “key financing and capital events—2013 financing events—amended and restated senior revolving credit facility” we borrowed approximately 3500 million of the 8000 million available under the new facility see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

on december 1 2014 we announced a capital allocation policy the “capital allocation policy” under which we intend to return approximately 80 percent of free cash flow less repayments of longterm debt to shareholders subject to a variety of factors including our strategic plans market and economic conditions and the board’s discretion for the purposes of the capital allocation policy we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property plant and equipment we also announced the 2014 share repurchase program pursuant to the capital allocation policy under the 2014 share repurchase program we intend to repurchase approximately 1 billion of our common shares over a four year period subject to the same factors and considerations described above the 2014 share repurchase program was effective december 1 2014 and the 300 million 2012 stock repurchase program was terminated on that date see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information with respect to our share repurchase programs 

cash management 

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

  

primary cash flow sources 

our longterm cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash our cash flows from operations is summarized as follows in millions 

 

 our cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014 increased by approximately 1540 million compared to the year ended december 31 2013 the increase is primarily attributable to higher net sales cost savings realized from our previously enacted restructuring programs and lower cash outflows from our restructuring activities 

our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on among other factors our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets 

our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below 

working capital 

working capital calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs in addition our working capital may be affected by acquisitions capital activities as part of our share repurchase programs and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments our working capital including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 7650 million at december 31 2014 and has fluctuated between 9131 million and 7435 million over the last eight quarterends although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives for the year ended december 31 2014 our working capital was most 

  

significantly impacted by our capital expenditures the acquisition of aptina and truesense the repurchase of our common stock and the payments associated with our restructuring activities see note 8 “longterm debt” note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” and note 9 “earnings per share and equity”of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

longterm assets and liabilities 

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets and goodwill 

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans generally our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions for additional information see note 11 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k and see note 15 “income taxes” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and 

  

expenses during the reporting period significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following i measurement of valuation allowances relating to trade receivables inventories and deferred tax assets ii estimates of future payouts for customer incentives and allowances warranties and restructuring activities iii assumptions surrounding future pension obligations iv fair values of sharebased compensation and of financial instruments including derivative financial instruments v evaluations of uncertain tax positions vi estimates and assumptions used in connection with business combinations and vi future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of goodwill and longlived assets if applicable actual results could differ from these estimates 

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue although to a much lesser extent from manufacturing services provided to customers distributor revenue is recognized in various ways within the industry dependent on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement with distributors some entities recognize revenue upon sale to the distributor while others like us recognize revenue when the sale is made to the end customer where the facts and circumstances of the distributor arrangements allow for such recognition additionally there can often be a lag in the data collection from distributors which may have an effect on our revenue recognition due to our high distributor sales revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy 

we recognize revenue on sales to oems distributors that are not entitled to returns and allowances and electronic manufacturing service providers net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

for products sold to distributors who are entitled to returns and allowances we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when we are informed by the distributor that it has resold the products to the enduser as a result of our inability to reliably estimate up front the effects of the returns and allowances with these distributors we defer the related revenue and gross margin on sales to these distributors until we are informed by the distributor that the products have been resold to the enduser at which point the ultimate sales price is known although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including value added and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience our oem customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under our general agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized and are netted against revenues we review warranty and related claims activity and record provisions as necessary 

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period of two years at the time revenue is recognized we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales recorded as a component of cost of revenues in addition we also offer cash discounts to certain customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time generally 10 days after shipment we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues based on experience with each customer 

  

freight and handling costs are included in the cost of revenues and are recognized as period expenses during the period in which they are incurred 

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected enduser demand these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory which is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

deferred tax valuation allowance  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will more likely than not be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense we maintain a valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets and most of our foreign deferred tax assets 

i mpairment of longlived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our asset groups that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value with related gains recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

goodwill  we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows discount and longterm growth rates we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments the assumptions about future conditions include factors such as future revenues gross profits operating expenses and industry trends changes in these estimates based on evolving economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable actual future results may differ from those estimates we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analysis 

  

the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets associated with that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets associate with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if during this second step we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

we have determined that our product families which are components of our operating segments constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill our product families are one level below the operating segments constituting individual businesses with our segment management conducting regular reviews of the operating results for each product family as of each acquisition date all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the acquired business included in a reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date 

our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of 2015 however identification of a triggering event may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods 

defined benefit pension plans and related benefits  we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our nonus employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs and estimated withdrawal liabilities are determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates for plan obligations assumed rates of return on pension plan assets and assumed rates of compensation increase for employees participating in the plans these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment and consultation with actuaries considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans as of december 31 2014 a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately 350 million 

contingencies  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

at december 31 2014 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 11926 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 4468 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 7458 million balance on our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of 

  

december 31 2014 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately 37 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase 

to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures from an accounting and economic perspective however given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the united states dollar as a normal part of the reporting process our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a nonfunctional currency changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged the notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2014 and 2013 was 1457 million and 1017 million respectively our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies including japanese yen euros malaysian ringgit philippines peso singapore dollars swiss francs chinese renminbi and czech koruna due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the us dollar for example we determined that based on a hypothetical weightedaverage change of 10 in currency exchange rates our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately 660 million as of december 31 2014 assuming no offsetting hedge positions 

see note 14 “financial instruments” of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further information with respect to our hedging activity

 item 9a   controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the exchange act based upon that evaluation our 

  

chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

on august 15 2014 we acquired aptina which operated under its own set of systems and internal controls we are separately maintaining aptina’s systems and much of its control environment until we are able to incorporate aptina’s processes into our own systems and control environment we currently expect to complete the integration of aptina’s operations into our systems and control environment by the end of the year ended december 31 2015 

on april 30 2014 we acquired truesense which operated under its own set of systems and internal controls we are separately maintaining truesense’s control environment until we are able to incorporate truesense’s processes into our own control environment we currently expect to complete the integration of truesense’s control environment by the end of the year ended december 31 2015 

other than as described above there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2014 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control—integrated framework 2013  we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2014 

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 excluded aptina which was acquired by the company on august 15 2014 and truesense which was acquired on april 30 2014 total excluded assets of aptina as of december 31 2014 represent approximately 5 of consolidated assets and aptina’s revenues for the period from august 15 2014 through december 31 2014 represents approximately 7 of consolidated revenues total excluded assets for truesense as of december 31 2014 represents less than 1 of consolidated assets and truesense revenues for the period from april 30 2014 through december 31 2014 represents approximately 2 of consolidated revenues 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” of this report

company highlights for the year ended december 31 2013 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 company history and capital structure 

prior to august 1999 we were a whollyowned subsidiary of motorola and operated as the semiconductor components group of motorola’s semiconductor products sector on august 4 1999 we were recapitalized the “recapitalization” and certain related transactions were effected pursuant to an agreement among us our principal domestic operating subsidiary sci llc motorola and affiliates of texas pacific group “tpg” during 2007 tpg sold all of its remaining shares of our common stock to multiple buyers and ceased being our principal stockholder 

  

recent company mergers and acquisitions 

we have historically pursued strategic acquisitions to leverage our existing capabilities and further build our business 

on january 1 2011 we paid sanyo electric 1421 million in cash and issued a 3775 million note payable to sanyo electric through sci llc in exchange for a 100 interest in sanyo semiconductor and certain other semiconductor related assets held by sanyo electric in the second quarter of 2011 we received approximately 397 million in cash from sanyo electric for working capital and pension adjustments as determined in accordance with the purchase agreement which resulted in a net purchase price of 4799 million 

the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor provided us with a stronger market presence in japan with many leading japanbased customers some of which were previously our customers we believe that this acquisition has provided and will continue to provide us with access to marketleading japanese and asian customers while providing our system solutions group’s customers with access to advanced frontend mixedsignal and analog manufacturing and ultra high volume backend facilities since acquiring sanyo semiconductor in 2011 we have incurred material restructuring expenses to achieve cost savings in order to align the system solutions group’s cost structure with expected revenue levels as the system solutions group experienced revenue and financial performance declines which were greater than our expectations and greater then cyclical declines in our other operating segments these revenue declines were at least partially attributable to the impact from the october 2011 thailand flood a softening of the japanese consumer market and to a lesser extent political tensions between japan and china see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations” under the heading “restructuring asset impairments and other net” included elsewhere in this report for additional information on our system solutions group restructuring activities on a longterm basis we expect our system solutions group to benefit from access to on semiconductor’s market leading customers not previously doing business with sanyo semiconductor in north america europe and china 

on february 27 2011 we acquired 100 of the cmos isbu from cypress semiconductor for 341 million in cash the isbu includes a broad portfolio of highperformance custom and standard image sensors used in multimegapixel machine vision linear and two dimensional 2d bar code imaging medical xray imaging biometrics digital photography and cinematography and aerospace applications the acquired products include the vita lupa star and ibis families which are all well known throughout the industry 

during 2010 we acquired 100 of sdt and cmd in all cash transactions during 2009 we acquired 100 of pulsecore in an all cash transaction among other benefits these acquisitions improved our position as a leader of certain technologies expanded our product offerings in certain endmarkets allowed us to reach more customers and enhanced our existing product portfolio

customers 

in general we have maintained longterm relationships with our key customers sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but typically do not require minimum purchase commitments most of our oem customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year while our other customers including electronic manufacturer service providers and distributors generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of endmarkets including computing automotive electronics consumer electronics industrial electronics wireless communications networking military aerospace and medical for the years ended december 31 2013 december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we had no sales to individual customers including distributors that accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues prior to 2011 sales to one of our distributors avnet represented 10 or more of total consolidated revenues as follows 13 and 11 for the years ended december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively revenues for our application products group and standard products group include distributor sales to avnet 

for the year ended december 31 2013 aggregate revenue from our five largest customers by revenue including distributors for our application products group standard products group and system solutions group comprised approximately 30  41 and 48 of total revenue for each respective operating segment the loss of certain of these customers or distributors may have a material adverse effect on the operations of the respective segment 

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period of two years generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days prior to shipment for custom products without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog” below 

  

endmarkets for our products 

the following table sets forth our principal endmarkets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each endmarket during 2013 sample applications for our products and representative oem customers and endusers 

 

 oems direct sales to oems accounted for approximately 48 of our revenues in 2013 55 of our revenues in 2012 and 56 of our revenues in 2011 oem customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as continental automotive systems delta electronics hella panasonic corporation and samsung electronics we focus on three types of oems multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core oem customers the target market customers for our endmarkets are oems that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our oem customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

  

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 44 of our revenues in 2013 38 of our revenues in 2012 and 37 of our revenues in 2011 our distributors which include arrow avnet os electronics world peace and wt microelectronics resell to midsized and smaller oems and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with certain of our distributors contain stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns due to current limitations on the feasibility of estimating the up front effect of returns and allowances with these distributors we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to these distributors until these distributors resell the product as a result sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 8 of our revenues in 2013 7 of our revenues in 2012 and 7 of our revenues in 2011 among our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are benchmark electronic flextronics hk towada electronics jabil and sanmina  these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for oems originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many oems now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace generally our electronic manufacturing service customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 18 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for revenues by geographic locations 

manufacturing operations 

we operate frontend wafer site facilities located in belgium canada czech republic japan malaysia and the united states and backend assembly and test site facilities located in canada china japan malaysia philippines and vietnam in addition to these frontend and backend manufacturing operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 

  

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities along with the approximate gross square footage of each site’s building which includes among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

 

  

  

  

 we operate all of our manufacturing facilities directly with the exception of our assembly and test operations facility located in leshan china which is owned by a joint venture company leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited “leshan” of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan 

  

radio company ltd is formerly a stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 70 of leshan’s production capacity in 2013 70 in 2012 70 in 2011 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 70 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2014 

we use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including amkor ase gracehhnec umc and utac accounted for approximately 26 23 and 23 of our manufacturing costs in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

for information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations see part i item 1a “risk factors” under the heading “trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” included elsewhere in this report 

raw materials 

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers gold copper and lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a justintime basis and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table which shows commitments contingencies and indemnities in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” under the heading “contractual obligations” included elsewhere in this report from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply increased demand in the industry or certain other factors 

sales marketing and distribution 

as of december 31 2013 our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 1100 professionals servicing customers in approximately 70 countries we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective global applications support from our technical information centers and solution engineering centers allowing for applications which are developed in one region of the world to be instantaneously available throughout all other regions 

patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights 

we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor ® and our on logo we own rights to a number of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other ip directly related to and important to our business in connection with our 1999 recapitalization motorola assigned licensed or sublicensed to us as the case may be certain ip to support and continue the operation of our business we also acquired or were licensed or sublicensed to a significant amount of ip including patents and patent applications in connection with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor in connection with the ip received from the sanyo semiconductor transaction we received a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from general unknown and certain known infringement claims from third parties as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 6200 us and foreign patents and approximately 1600 patent applications pending worldwide our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2014 to 2033 none of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect 

  

our business additionally we have rights to more than 293 registered and common law trademarks our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our ip rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents copyrights and other ip rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 

seasonality 

historically our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related endmarkets consisting of a stronger second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year we have in the past experienced substantial quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenues and operating results and in the future could continue to experience shortterm periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

backlog 

our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are predominantly booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our electronic data interface customers in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times for those shipments to distributors who are allowed sales return rights and allowances we record revenues on a “sellthrough” basis thus backlog comprised of orders from these distributors will not result in revenues until these distributors sell the products ordered during 2013 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 82 and 87 of actual revenues during such quarter which is consistent with backlog levels in recent prior periods as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases customers tend to order products further in advance and as a result backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 

in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 

we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 

competition 

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for generalpurpose semiconductor products like ours is highly competitive although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fully customized ics as well as customers who develop their own ic products see part i item 1a “risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” located elsewhere in this report for additional information 

in comparison several competitors noted below are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and 

  

distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions the following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments 

application products group 

the principal methods of competition in the application products group are with other custom semiconductor vendors based on design experience manufacturing capability depth and quality of ip ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product length of design cycle longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel 

our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables both inside and outside of our control these variables include but are not limited to the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies product performance and quality manufacturing yields and availability customer service pricing industry trends and general economic trends select competitors for certain of our products and solutions include elmos semiconductor ag intersil corporation maxim integrated products inc melexis nv stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments inc 

standard products group 

the standard products group’s competitive strengths are in our market leading protection and filtering products the breadth of our portfolio technical performance micropackaging expertise our high quality low cost structure and supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers in addition our strengths include our strong ip portfolio and our ability to leverage ip blocks across the company to develop high valueadded assps 

the principal methods of competing in our discrete semiconductor products are through new product and package innovations with enhanced performance over existing products of particular importance are our transient voltage protection and filtering portfolios esd protection and common mode filters power switching and rectification products where we believe we enjoy significant performance advantages over our competition select competitors for certain of our products include diodes incorporated fairchild semiconductor international inc infineon technologies ag kec corporation nxp bv rohm co ltd semtech corporation stmicroelectronics nv and vishay intertechnology inc 

system solutions group 

the principal methods of competition for the system solutions group are technical performance quality service and price our competitive strengths are strong technology and design capability breadth of product portfolio systems design expertise and longstanding supply relationships with leading oem customers select competitors for certain of our products include fairchild semiconductor international inc international rectifier corporation mitsubishi electric nxp bv renasas electronics corporation rohm co ltd sanken electric stmicroelectronics nv texas instruments incorporated and toshiba corporation 

  

research and development 

companysponsored research and development costs in 2013 2012 and 2011 were 3342 million 120 of revenue 3675 million 127 of revenue and 3625 million 105 of revenue respectively our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications during 2013 research and development costs decreased as a result of restructuring activities in our system solutions group 

government regulation 

our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 

our headquarters in phoenix arizona is located on property that is a “superfund” site a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to cleanup activities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act motorola and now freescale semiconductor inc “freescale” have been actively involved in the cleanup of onsite solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and offsite contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola retained responsibility for this contamination and motorola and freescale have agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter 

our former manufacturing location in aizu japan is located on property where soil and ground water contamination has been detected we believe that the contamination originally occurred during a time when the facility was operated by a prior owner we have been working with local authorities to implement remediation actions and expect all remaining remediation costs to be covered by insurance based on information available any net costs to us in connection with this matter are not expected to be material 

our manufacturing facility in the czech republic has ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that this facility was operated by governmentowned entities the remediation project consists primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located onsite and offsite with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded the government of the czech republic has agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries subject to specified limitations for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination based upon the information available we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 

our design center in east greenwich rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination when we purchased the east greenwich facility we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property based on the information available we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

as a result of the acquisition of amis in 2008 we are a “primary responsible party” to an environmental remediation and cleanup at amis’s former corporate headquarters in santa clara california costs incurred by amis include implementation of the cleanup plan operations and maintenance of remediation systems and other project management costs however amis’s former parent company a subsidiary of nippon mining contractually agreed to indemnify amis and us for any obligation relating to environmental remediation and cleanup at this location based on the information available we do not believe that any future costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and liability for currently known environmental conditions to have a material 

  

adverse effect on our business or prospects it is possible however that future developments including changes in laws and regulations government policies customer specification personnel and physical property conditions including currently undiscovered contamination could lead to material costs 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 22000 employees worldwide of which approximately 2300 employees were in the united states none of our employees in the united states are covered by collective bargaining agreements certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements ie japan and belgium or similar arrangements or are represented by workers councils for information regarding employee risk associated with our international operations see part i item 1a “risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” elsewhere in this report of the total number of our employees as of december 31 2013 approximately 18100 were engaged in manufacturing approximately 1100 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization which includes customer service approximately 700 were engaged in administration and approximately 2100 were engaged in research and development

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

from time to time we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and incur additional operating losses in the future 

at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses reduced enduser demand price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity the effects of natural disasters such as the flooding in thailand or the japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011 and other factors have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our business in order to remain profitable we must continue to successfully implement our business plan and examine and implement potentially advantageous cost reduction initiatives 

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns and upturns 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and as a result is subject to significant downturns and upturns the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines 

  

in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices in the event of such a downturn our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges on the other hand significant upturns have led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in the event of such an upturn we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected we may also not be able to balance our expansion activities and actual demand in such an environment the overbuilding of capacity and excess increases of inventory by us and other companies can result in overcapacity in the industry and general price erosion 

in some ways we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience them in the future we cannot accurately predict the timing of the current and future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these conditions might be these future conditions in the semiconductor industry could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

economic conditions including those related to the credit markets may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in fluctuations to and reductions in consumer and commercial spending from time to time among other things such uncertainties may result in lower orders from our customers for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions reduced spending has in the past driven us and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which results in a negative impact on gross profit volatility in global economic conditions may adversely and materially affect our industry business and results of operations and we cannot accurately predict volatility or how severe and prolonged any downturn or recovery might be in addition to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected our business and results of operations could be adversely and materially affected moreover volatility in revenues as a result of unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our shortterm and longterm strategies 

furthermore the united states and global credit markets could experience renewed financial turmoil if the past pressures on credit were renewed or we experience an additional global downturn we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all and we may not be able to refinance if necessary any outstanding debt when due all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures for the immediate future if our operating results falter and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition global financial uncertainty affecting the financial and other markets could impact our business in a number of other ways including causing 1 our customers and consumers in general to defer purchases 2 our customers difficulties in obtaining sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us 3 our key suppliers to become capacityconstrained or insolvent resulting in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and 4 our key suppliers to require acceleration of payments to them or our customers to delay payments to us any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses incurring additional debt assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 

in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts we face risks resulting from the expansion of our operations through acquisitions including but not limited to 1 the difficulty of integrating aligning and coordinating organizations which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures 2 risks of entering new semiconductor markets or regions of the world in which we have limited experience 3 risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies particularly if such company is lacking adequate financial reporting and internal control systems or possesses systems that are materially different from ours 4 the risk that our due diligence in the acquisition process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities that are in existence at the time of our acquisitions 5 the risk that our existing or prospective customers or customers of the acquired business may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions as we integrate new businesses and companies into our business or that they may seek to change their existing business relationships 6 challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions including difficulties in entering into new market segments in which we are not experienced 7 the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets 8 difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses and 9 negative pressure on gross margins resulting from increased operating and restructuring costs associated with the target 

in addition current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us and as a result we could lose key employees these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel in connection with a transaction key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in the form of changeincontrol agreements acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equitybased compensation rights further as a result of our acquisitions we may assume liabilities from the target’s current employee benefit plans that may require us to bring plan documentation into compliance with current law including ensuring that plans are adequately funded 

in connection with our acquisition activity we are required by generally accepted accounting principles and sec rules and regulations to integrate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or if they do have independent audited financial statements such statements may not be prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems which could materially impair our ability to obtain or prepare necessary financial information concerning such businesses in a format required to allow proper integration with our systems and financials in addition immediately after an acquisition and until such time as we are able to fully integrate an acquired business into our financial statements we may be dependent on the acquired business’ financial controls and systems for reporting and other financial information including projections and goals for such acquired business we may not be able to successfully prepare and file required financial statements or other financial information for the acquired business or to integrate the acquired business into our financial controls and systems and our consolidated financial statements in a timely manner failure to prepare accurate financial reports for our acquired businesses in a timely manner in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could cause material inaccuracies in our financial statements and sec filings which could result in the necessity to restate our financials or lead to unknown liabilities and possibly result in a material impact on our stock price 

  

the integration of newly acquired businesses will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships moreover even if we were able to fully integrate a new acquisition’s business operations and other assets successfully there can be no assurance that such integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from the acquisition or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time delays in integrating our acquisitions which could be caused by factors outside of our control could adversely affect the intended benefits of the acquisitions to our business financial results financial condition and stock price 

in connection with an acquisition it is possible that we may anticipate tax savings through integration of the newly acquired business into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure as with any estimate it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be incorrect 

we review goodwill associated with our acquisitions for impairment at least on an annual basis see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 2 “significant accounting policies—goodwill” of the notes to our consolidated audited financial statements located elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information about goodwill in the past we recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions factors we consider important that could result in a subsequent impairment to goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues andor increased costs we may have further material goodwill impairments further material goodwill impairments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results in any such case it is possible that factors outside of our control including but not limited to increases in interest rates and loss of key customers could adversely affect the intended benefits from an acquisition even though we would continue to have a repayment obligation under the related loan agreement 

our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization and realizing expected synergies from acquisitions 

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing for instance if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits in addition increased competition and other factors beyond our control including economic factors may lead to price erosion lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

moreover we believe that we will need to continue to improve the margin levels of our system solutions group business and successfully execute on available opportunities in order to realize the intended benefits of this transaction while we anticipate that certain cost reduction measures taken including the voluntary retirement programs implemented in 2013 should improve its margin levels we may not be able to benefit fully from such actions 

  

the failure to successfully implement our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions including restructuring activities could adversely affect our business 

from time to time we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to among other things significant downturns in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs have been primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on restructuring activities 

we also often undertake restructuring activities in connection with our business acquisitions which can result in significant charges including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges 

we cannot assure you that our restructuring plans and cost reduction initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented or will materially impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition 

for additional information regarding our profitability enhancement programs and cost reduction measures see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 continue to aggressively manage maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 further expand our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 rationalize our manufacturing operations 7 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 8 reduce selling and administrative expenses 9 manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands 10 actively manage working capital 11 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 12 integrate newly acquired products manufacturing capabilities and sales channels we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other things to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our ip portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance 

  

personnel several of these factors and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities the impact of natural disasters increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process and often requires significant capital investment additionally expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers including changes due to evolving consumer preferences international political developments influencing enduser preferences and natural disasters or other extraordinary events that impact our customers or endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects moreover we may make significant investment in new products that may not be profitable or that do not have margins as high as we anticipated or experienced historically 

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days for custom products without incurring a significant penalty we routinely generate inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation 

  

or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive as a result of current economic uncertainty competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness many of our competitors particularly larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fully customized ics as well as from customers who develop their own ic products 

we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers tablets industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends 

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other things capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities including as a part of our cost reduction measures and in reaction to manmade and natural disasters such as the 2011 flooding in thailand upgrading or expanding existing facilities changing our process technologies or uncertainty as a result of the acquisition and integration of manufacturing facilities acquired as a result of our 

  

acquisition activities any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing information technology and equipment to remain competitive the failure inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and such capital expenditures and commitments as well as other commitments may materially decrease our liquidity 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices we maintain certain of our own manufacturing assembly and test facilities which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume however there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and utilize these new technologies there also is no assurance that the new technologies we do develop and utilize will be sufficient to support our business operations and strategies or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such new technologies 

we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency any such implementation however can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or in some instances to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned in the case of abandonment we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

in the recent past we have undertaken various and material cost reduction measures which we believe have been largely successful however these reductions and any future reductions may unintentionally affect our ability to remain competitive in efficiency and productivity ultimately we may be forced to increase our future capital expenditures in unexpected ways to meet our operational needs in among other areas manufacturing information technology and equipment we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make timely and necessary investments in the areas discussed above or other areas we have not identified 

we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and other business disruptions 

our worldwide operations are subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions from time to time which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial reporting and condition we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods hurricanes typhoons droughts and other extreme weather conditions earthquakes tsunamis volcanoes and similar natural disasters as well as power outages power shortages telecommunications failures industrial accidents and similar events such events can cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property including our books and financial and corporate records and data and related internal controls and can also have significant direct and indirect consequences for example such events can negatively impact revenues and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event such costs may include expenses to restore production or to move production to other facilities including incremental capital expenditures and costs for expedited shipping expenses incurred with a shutdown of the damaged facility including employee severance payments and other unusual costs and expenses such as fixed asset impairments inventory writedowns charges relating to cancellation of purchase orders for excess materials and charges for restoration and recovery work overall costs may also be impacted by other factors such as the underabsorption of our 

  

manufacturing and operating support overhead for example in the case of our facility in roznov czech republic that manufactures silicon wafers used by a number of our facilities any natural or manmade disaster operational disruption or other extraordinary event that impacted the facility or regional infrastructure would have a substantial adverse effect on our ability to produce a number of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business revenues costs andor prospects if we were unable to effectively source silicon from qualified third parties to replace the production loss such events may also affect the infrastructure of the country in which the event occurs causing water damage power outages transportation delays and restrictions public health issues and economic instability and disrupting local and international supply chains as a result we could experience shortages of and interruptions in supply and increased prices for components that we source from companies located in or with operations in any such country as well as from other suppliers whose supply chains may similarly be affected such shortages and interruptions may also affect our ability to timely deliver our products to customers and as a result our customers may seek substitute products from other manufacturers consequences such as power outages including any rolling blackouts or other anticipated problems could adversely affect our business by among other things interrupting our production capacity harming our internal operations limiting our ability to communicate with our customers and suppliers and limiting our customers’ ability to sell or use our products in addition damage or destruction to our property including our books and financial and corporate records and data could adversely affect our ability to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the historical and future reporting of our financial results and our ability to integrate the financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies responding to natural disasters and their consequences will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above such insurance may be subject to deductible and coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner the costs of our raw materials increase significantly their quality deteriorates or the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including polysilicon silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

in addition for some of our products we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt production in material ways in addition we cannot assure you that we 

  

will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect in any such case arranging for replacement contractors can be time consuming and costly and we may encounter startup difficulties 

regulations that impose disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in our products will result in additional cost and expense and could result in other significant adverse effects 

rules adopted by the sec implementing the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in our products compliance with these rules will result in additional cost and expense including for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities these rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our semiconductor devices as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals or components that can be used in our products there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such metals or components in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices the cost of compliance to our service providers foundries subcontractors and suppliers could also be passed along to us resulting in higher prices for the materials or components we use in our products also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the metals used in our products we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the asiapacific region the americas and europe similarly we maintain significant operations in these regions in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the last few fiscal years we have benefited from relatively low effective tax rates because most of our income has been earned and reinvested in jurisdictions outside the us our effective tax rate is uncertain on an ongoing basis changes to income tax regulations in the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could under our existing tax structure significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operations and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition business combinations and investment transactions changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes and changes in available tax credits could increase our future effective tax rate changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by our increasing or decreasing operations in jurisdictions with higher or lower rates as well as by changes in rates or the laws that determine when we are subject to taxation in a specific jurisdiction 

we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt repurchases payments and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations through borrowings under our current debt agreements or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

other activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange for instance while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

our success both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and financial personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive in addition from time to time we have announced certain cost reductions that included the freezing of salaries and elimination of bonuses mandatory unpaid time off factory shutdowns and reduction in personnel we also establish performance criteria for awards to officers and employees under bonus and other incentive plans and programs that may not be satisfied these measures as 

  

well as any future measures could negatively affect morale and lead to unintended employee attrition at all levels of our organization moreover we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel and our existing employment agreements do not require the employee to continue to work for us 

as employee incentives we have issued common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time rsus with timebased vesting and performancebased awards any difficulty relating to obtaining stockholder approval of new or amendments to equity compensation plans could limit our ability to issue these types of awards our stock price at times has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of certain of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered ip assets patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies these laws and regulations are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts additionally some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications with respect to our ip generally we cannot assure you that 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective ip protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty ip rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such ip rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for ip we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

 

  

  

  

  

   

we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

we also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to ip arising out of our research 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

our ability to enforce our patents trademarks copyrights software licenses and other ip is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged ip rights 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

all industries including the semiconductor industry are subject to legal claims with and without merit including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general we are involved in a variety of legal matters most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers employment and labor and ip we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however defense and settlement costs can be substantial even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

as mentioned above from time to time we have been or may in the future be involved in securities litigation or litigation arising from our acquisitions we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation matter in which we are a party these types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future in addition we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions will not subject us to additional litigation see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for more information on our legal proceedings 

  

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards 

like most publicly traded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm as we continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future 

there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future failure to comply with sox including delaying or failing to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such transactions and the trading price of our common stock may decline in addition if we fail to remedy any material weakness our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements our financial statements may be materially inaccurate our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other things regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operation of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization and spinout from motorola we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities 

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

 

  

  

   

  

 warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process requiring production in a tightly controlled clean environment minute impurities in our manufacturing materials contaminants in the manufacturing environment manufacturing equipment failures and other defects can cause our products to be noncompliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design oems are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage if any and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved in certain instances we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective 

new legal requirements particularly with respect to health care reform could increase the cost of our employee benefits and adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations 

we incur significant costs to maintain competitive employee benefits to attract and retain our highly skilled personnel changes to the regulatory environment with respect to these benefits could adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations in particular the health care reform legislation enacted by the us congress is intended to result in significant changes to the us health care system this legislation may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of the new healthcare regulations and may impair our ability to provide the same level of coverage 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could damage our reputation and harm our business and operating results 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses illegal hacking or acts of vandalism or terrorism additionally the proprietary sensitive or confidential information we manage and store may be subject to accidental loss misuse inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination our security measures andor those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales 

  

manufacturing distribution or other critical functions any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information cause an interruption in our operations result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data result in a violation of privacy or other laws expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation which could harm our business and operating results 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

despite the fact that we have recently retired some of our past debt obligations with existing cash flow we are still highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations in addition we may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments from time to time the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness from time to time may limit us and our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next 12 months if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities moreover the debt we may incur from time to time may require collateral to secure such indebtedness which would place our assets at risk as well as limit our flexibility related to such assets ultimately we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all and we may need to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 

  

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

our debt agreements from time to time may contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which could cross default other indebtedness we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements from time to time may contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to then current stockholders 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may impact the value of our common stock a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter in addition to the other factors described above factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had significant variance and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

 although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders as announced in our current report on form 8k filed on november 25 2013 we intend to submit certain changes to our certificate of incorporation to a vote of our shareholders at our 2014 annual meeting to i phase in the declassification of the board over a three year period beginning in 2014 and ii remove the prohibition on shareholders acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting

 as of february 18 2014 there were approximately 262 holders of record of our common stock and 440421919 shares of common stock outstanding 

we have neither declared nor paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our initial public offering our future dividend policy with respect to our common stock will depend upon our earnings capital requirements financial condition debt restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by tax considerations as described in note 15 “income taxes” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

our senior revolving credit facility permits us to pay cash dividends to our common stockholders if after giving effect thereto the senior leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the credit agreement does not exceed 275 to 100 as of december 31 2013 we were within the required senior leverage ratio and therefore permitted to pay cash dividends under our senior revolving credit facility see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion of our revolving credit facility

this executive overview presents summary information regarding our industry markets business and operating trends only for further information relating to the information summarized herein see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in its entirety 

industry overview 

according to wsts an industry research firm worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 3056 billion in 2013 an increase of approximately 48 from 2916 billion in 2012 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our serviceable addressable market “sam” since 2009 

 

  

  

 worldwide semiconductor industry sales declined 90 in 2009 grew 318 in 2010 grew 04 in 2011 declined 26 in 2012 and grew 48 in 2013 following a pattern associated with the financial crisis subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty the increased of 48 from 2012 to 2013 is related to global macroeconomic conditions within the semiconductor industry affecting sales in all geographic regions  

  

sales in our sam increased to 856 billion in 2009 to 1102 billion in 2010 decreased to 1074 billion in 2011 decreased to 1037 billion in 2012 and increased to 1039 billion in 2013 the increase of approximately 02 from 1037 billion in 2012 to 1039 billion in 2013 is consistent with the trend in the worldwide semiconductor market the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our sam of approximately 35 for the next three years these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 

recent results 

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 were 27827 million a decrease of approximately 4 from 28949 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the majority of which was due to lower revenues generated in our system solutions group from a weakened demand environment associated with a further softening of the japanese consumer market a weakened yen and to a lesser extent political tensions between japan and china  during 2013 we reported net income attributable to on semiconductor corporation of 1508 million compared to a net loss of 906 million in 2012 which was primarily due to asset impairments within our system solutions group during 2012 our gross margin increased by approximately 80 basis points to 337 in 2013 from 329 in 2012 primarily driven by changes in volume and mix across certain of our product lines 

during 2013 the majority of our restructuring and cost saving initiatives were focused on our system solutions group which included certain voluntary retirement programs and the planned closure of our kss facility 

for further information with respect to our restructuring activity including our other restructuring and cost savings programs initiated during 2013 see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 

business overview 

we are driving innovation in energy efficient electronics our extensive portfolio of power and signal management logic discrete and custom devices helps customers efficiently solve their design challenges in advanced electronic systems and products our power management and motor driver semiconductor components control convert protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our custom asics use analog dsp mixedsignal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive medical militaryaerospace consumer and industrial customers’ products our data management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing communications and industrial systems our image sensors optical image stabilization and auto focus devices provide advanced imaging solutions for optical systems our standard semiconductor components serve as “building blocks” within virtually all types of electronic devices these various products fall into the logic analog discrete image sensors and memory categories used by the wsts group 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have reduced or shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have caused demand to strengthen production volumes have historically stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand reaches levels above capacity production capabilities shortages begin to occur which typically causes pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

  

new product innovation 

our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications as always it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position ourselves for continued growth as a result we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity logic analog memory and discrete products we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 

business and macroeconomic environment influence on cost savings and restructuring activities 

we have recognized efficiencies from implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure however the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions while there have been recent indications of improving conditions our business environment continues to experience significant uncertainty and volatility we have historically reviewed and will continue to review our cost structure capital investments and other expenditures to align our spending and capacity with our current sales and manufacturing projections 

we have historically taken significant actions to align our overall cost structure with our expected revenue levels such actions continued in 2013 within our system solutions group as its revenue and financial performance declined greater than our longterm expectations for the operating segment 

to further improve our cost structure within our system solutions group during 2013 we announced two voluntary retirement programs for employees of certain of our system solutions group subsidiaries in addition to a plan to close kss by the end of the second quarter of 2014 the “kss plan” 

see “results of operations” under the heading “restructuring asset impairments and other net” below along with note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details relating to our most recent cost saving actions 

outlook 

on semiconductor q1 2014 outlook 

based upon product booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we estimate that our revenues will be approximately 695 million to 725 million in the first quarter of 2014 backlog levels for the first quarter of 2014 represent approximately 80 to 85 of our anticipated first quarter 2014 revenues we estimate average selling prices for the first quarter of 2014 will be down approximately two percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 for the first quarter of 2014 we estimate that gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be approximately 33 to 35 

  

results of operations 

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 in millions 

 

 revenues 

revenues were 27827 million 28949 million and 34423 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease from 2012 to 2013 was the result of decreased revenue in our system solutions group from a weakened demand environment associated with a further softening of the japanese consumer market and a weakened yen which was partially offset in increased revenue from our other operating segments 

for the year ended december 31 2013 we experienced a decline in average selling prices of approximately 7 as compared to 2012 partially offset by favorable changes in volume and mix which resulted in a net decrease in revenue of approximately 4  

the decrease in revenues from 2011 to 2012 was the result of a combination of factors which included the continued impact from the october 2011 thailand flood a softening of the japanese consumer market and to a lesser extent political tensions between japan and china which began to impact our revenue levels in the second half of 2012 

  

revenues by reportable segment for each of the three years below were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

 revenues from the application products group 

revenues from the application products group increased by 171 million or approximately 2 from 2012 to 2013 and decreased from 2011 to 2012 by 1263 million or approximately 11 

the 2013 increase resulted from an increase in revenues from analog products of 299 million or approximately 8 and an increase in revenues from tmos products of 50 million or approximately 15 partially offset by a decrease in revenues from asic products of 104 million or approximately 2 and a decrease in revenues from ecl products of 69 million or approximately 15 

the 2012 decrease in revenue can be attributed to a decrease in revenue from asic products of 709 million or approximately 11 a decrease in revenue from analog products of 203 million or approximately 5 and a decrease in foundry services revenue of 134 million or approximately 49 with the remainder of the decrease primarily associated with our highfrequency products 

revenues from the standard products group 

revenues from the standard products group increased by 165 million or approximately 1 from 2012 to 2013 and decreased from 2011 to 2012 by 1318 million or approximately 11 

the 2013 increase resulted from an increase in revenues from discrete products of 249 million or approximately 6 and an increase in revenues from analog products of 89 million or approximately 3 partially offset by a decrease in revenues from tmos products of 138 million or approximately 6 

the 2012 decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to decreases in discrete products of 741 million or approximately 15 a decrease in analog products revenue of 281 million or approximately 9 and a decrease in revenue from memory products of 251 million or approximately 31 with the remaining decrease primarily associated with our tmos products 

revenues from the system solutions group 

revenues from the system solutions group decreased by 1458 million or approximately 19 from 2012 to 2013 and decreased from 2011 to 2012 by 2893 million or approximately 27 

the 2013 decrease resulted from a further softening of the japanese consumer market a weakening yen and to a lesser extent political tensions between japan and china 

the 2012 decrease in revenue is primarily due to the continued impact from the october 2011 thailand flooding which permanently damaged one of our system solutions group’s manufacturing locations a softening of the japanese consumer market and to a lesser extent political tensions between japan and china which began to impact revenue levels in the second half of 2012 

  

revenues by geographic location 

revenues by geographic location for each of the three years below were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

 for additional information see the table of revenues by geographic location included in note 18 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

gross profit and gross margin 

our gross profit by reportable segment in each of the three years below was as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

  

 our gross profit was 9384 million 9519 million and 10088 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the gross profit decrease of 135 million or approximately 1 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2012 is primarily attributable to decreases in gross profit in our system solutions group as a result of lower revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 as well as smaller decreases in gross profit from our other operating segments 

the gross profit decrease from 2011 to 2012 is primarily attributable to decreases in gross profit in our application products group and standard products group partially offset by a 640 million increase in gross profit for our system solutions group which primarily resulted from charges incurred during 2011 for the stepup in fair market value of inventory and noncash manufacturing expenses which were not incurred during 2012 

gross margin increased to approximately 34 during 2013 compared to approximately 33 during 2012 this increase was primarily driven by changes in volume and mix across certain product lines 

the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues from 2011 to 2012 is related to the increase in gross profit in our system solutions group and is a direct result of certain expenses which we recorded during 2011 and for which we did not incur expenses in 2012 the 2011 expenses included the the impact of the stepup 

  

in fair market value of inventory of 583 million and 804 million of noncash manufacturing expenses gross margin was also impacted by cost savings from our restructuring activities as discussed below further offset by volume and revenue declines 

operating expenses 

research and development 

research and development expenses were 3342 million 3675 million and 3625 million representing approximately 120 127 and 105 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the decrease in research and development expenses of 333 million or approximately 9 from 2012 to 2013 is primarily associated with decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group along with the impact of a weakened yen 

the increase in research and development expenses from 2011 to 2012 was due to increased costs related to the usage of engineering materials and depreciation for new capital projects and design software 

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expenses were 1712 million 1809 million and 1951 million representing approximately 62 62 and 57 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the decrease in selling and marketing expenses of 97 million or approximately 5 from 2012 to 2013 is primarily associated with decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group along with the impact of a weakened yen 

the decrease in selling and marketing expenses from 2011 to 2012 was primarily attributable to planned reductions in workforce reductions in bonus and sharebased compensation expenses reduced travel costs and a reduction in outside services 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses were 1485 million 1606 million and 1924 million representing approximately 53 55 and 56 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the decrease in general and administrative expenses of 121 million or approximately 7 from 2012 to 2013 is primarily associated with decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group along with the impact of a weakened yen 

the decrease in general and administrative expenses from 2011 to 2012 was primarily attributable to reductions in outside services and reductions in the use of consultants along with the impact of reduced bonus decreased sharebased compensation expenses and lower royalty expenses 

amortization of acquisition—related intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 331 million 444 million and 427 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease of 113 million or approximately 25 from 2012 to 2013 is the result of the impairment of certain of the system solutions group’s intangible assets recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

  

the increase in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets from 2011 to 2012 was primarily attributed to increased amortization resulting from completed iprd projects assumed as part of our recent acquisitions which were not amortized while inprocess and for which 2012 was the first full year of amortization upon the completion of the associated projects 

restructuring asset impairments and other net 

restructuring asset impairments and other net was 332 million 1653 million and 1027 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the information below summarizes the major activities in each year for additional information see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we initiated two voluntary retirement programs for certain employees of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan approximately 500 employees opted to retire pursuant to the first program and substantially all employees had retired by december 31 2013 approximately 350 employees opted to retire pursuant to the second program and 170 employees had retired by december 31 2013 the remaining employees who accepted retirement packages are expected to retire by the end of 2014 as part of these restructuring activities approximately 70 contractor positions were also identified for elimination of which approximately half were terminated by the end of 2013 with the remaining contractors to be terminated by the end of 2014 subsequent to december 31 2013 we identified approximately 40 additional positions within the company that are expected be eliminated as an extension of the second voluntary retirement program we anticipate total cost savings for the second voluntary retirement program which includes the above referenced amounts to be within the range of our previously disclosed expectations of 36 million to 45 million during the first year following the completion of the anticipated headcount reductions 

we recorded net charges of approximately 373 million in connection with these programs consisting of employee severance charges of 529 million partially offset by pension and related retirement liability adjustments associated with the affected employees which resulted in a pension curtailment benefit of 156 million 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded 31 million of restructuring charges related to the announced closure of our aizu facility we also released approximately 210 million of associated cumulative foreign currency translation gains related to our subsidiary that owned the aizu facility which utilized the japanese yen as its functional currency the related amount was recorded as a benefit to restructuring asset impairments and other net on the company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for additional information see note 16 “changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

additionally we announced the kss plan during the fourth quarter of 2013 pursuant to the kss plan a majority of the production from kss will be transferred to other companyowned backend manufacturing facilitieswe recorded approximately 100 million of net restructuring charges related to the kss plan during the year ended december 31 2013 consisting of employee severance charges of 65 million and 35 million of asset impairment charges associated with the kss plan 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we initiated a voluntary retirement program for certain employees of our system solutions group and certain of its subsidiaries we recorded net charges of approximately 359 million associated with this program consisting of employee severance charges of 476 million partially offset by 117 million attributed to pension plan curtailment gains 

  

additionally during the year ended december 31 2012 we executed a global workforce reduction program restructuring expenses resulting from this program consisted primarily of 112 million associated with employee severance charges 

we incurred additional charges related to the closure of certain of our facilities during 2012 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 57 million of employee separation charges and other charges associated with the closure of our ayutthaya thailand facility and partial closure of our bang pa in thailand facility in addition to 85 million of employee separation charges and other costs associated with the planned shutdown of operations at our facility in aizu japan 

as part of the sanyo semiconductor acquisition we announced plans to integrate certain operations of sanyo semiconductor into our existing operations primarily for cost savings purposes during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 85 million in charges related to this integration additionally we recorded exit costs of approximately 15 million for items relating to the consolidation of factories 

indefinite and longlived asset impairment charges 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we evaluated the current period operating results of the system solutions group and reassessed future projections for the segment as a result we determined that 944 million of carrying value for certain longlived assets associated with the system solutions group and 316 million of related intangible assets were impaired for additional information see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k and see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we further determined that approximately 141 million in carrying value of goodwill relating to our 2008 acquisition of catalyst was impaired resulting from a strategic decision to invest in other business units and the resulting decline in estimated future cash flows as part of our annual goodwill testing it was determined that certain intangible assets associated with the standard products group were impaired in connection with this impairment we wroteoff approximately 38 million of intangible assets these goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were recognized in our standard products group segment see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 248 million of asset impairment charges associated with the closure of our ayutthaya thailand facility and partial closure of our bang pa in thailand facility due to flooding that occurred in that region additionally we recorded a 283 million inventory writeoff as a result of the flooding the asset impairment charges and inventory writeoff were partially offset by the receipt of insurance recoveries of 489 million 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 615 million of asset impairment charges associated with the announced shutdown of our aizu japan wafer manufacturing facility and 48 million of other charges relating to damaged inventory and other assets resulting from the japanese earthquake and tsunami that occurred during 2011 

  

operating income 

information about operating income from our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2013 december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 is as follows in millions 

 

 depreciation and amortization expense is included in segment operating income reconciliations of segment information to financial statements is as follows in millions 

 

  

 other income and expenses 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased by 175 million from 561 million in 2012 to 386 million in 2013 additionally interest expense decreased by 128 million from 689 million in 2011 to 561 million in 2012 we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of 112 million 234 million and 349 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our average longterm debt balance including current maturities and net of debt discount during 2013 2012 and 2011 was 9771 million 11095 million and 10480 million respectively our weighted average interest rate on longterm debt including current maturities and net of debt discount was approximately 39 51 and 66 per annum in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources—key financing and capital events” below for a description of our refinancing activities 

other 

other income decreased by 27 million from a gain of 58 million in 2012 to a gain of 31 million in 2013 other expense decreased by 147 million from a loss of 89 million in 2011 to a gain of 58 million in 2012 

  

loss on debt repurchase or exchange 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we exchanged 600 million in principal value 574 million of carrying value of our 2625 notes for 585 million in principal value of our 2625 notes series b plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2625 notes resulting in a loss on debt repurchase of 31 million subject to certain other terms and conditions this transaction extended the earliest put date for the exchanged amount from december 2013 to december 2016 

see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we exchanged 999 million in par value 928 million of carrying value of our 2625 notes for 999 million in par value of 2625 notes series b and 20 million in cash which resulted in a loss on debt exchange of 78 million this exchange extended the first put date of the underlying notes which we consider to be the earliest maturity date from december 2013 to december 2016 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we exchanged 1986 million in par value 1772 million of carrying value of our 2625 notes for 1986 million in par value 1764 million of carrying value of 2625 notes series b and 159 million in cash which resulted in a loss on debt exchange of 179 million this exchange extended the first put date of the underlying notes which we consider to be the earliest maturity date 

additionally during the year ended december 31 2011 we repurchased 530 million in par value 466 million of carrying value of our 2625 notes for 562 million in cash which resulted in a loss on debt repurchase of 53 million 

gain on sanyo semiconductor transaction 

the purchase price of sanyo semiconductor was less than the fair value of its net assets resulting in a gain on acquisition of 243 million during 2011 we believe the gain recognized upon acquisition was the result of a number of factors including the following sanyo electric’s desire to discontinue semiconductor operations significant losses recognized by sanyo electric sanyo electric considering an acquisition as the best outcome for sanyo semiconductor and that significant costs were expected to be incurred in association with the transfer and consolidation of certain operations for additional information see note 4 “acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 269 million 134 million and 229 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the 2013 provision of 269 million included 222 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations 09 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions and 132 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill this is partially offset by the reversal of 60 million of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and the reversal of 34 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2013 

  

the 2012 provision of 134 million included 217 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 09 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions this is partially offset by 78 million of additional tax benefit recorded and the reversal of 14 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2012 

the 2011 provision for income taxes of 229 million included 194 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations 32 million of additional valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets and 29 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions this is partially offset by the reversal of 26 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2011 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 was 149 which differs from the us statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries our effective tax rate was also lower than the us statutory federal income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012 due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries our effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory federal income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2011 due to the impact of impairment losses and other operating losses recognized during the year in foreign jurisdictions for which tax benefits have not been recognized due to uncertainty regarding their future realization exists we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our domestic and japan related deferred tax assets 

included in our results for the fourth quarter of 2013 is the impact of a prior period error of approximately 107 million related to our conclusion that certain deferred tax liabilities may not be netted against deferred tax assets prior to determining the required valuation allowance the error was first corrected by separating the indefinite deferred tax liability from net deferred tax assets by recording a 107 million increase in longterm deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase in longterm deferred tax liabilities included within other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 the increase in deferred tax assets caused an increase in the valuation allowance of 107 million and a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the year then ended we believe that this error is not material to our consolidated financial statements of any prior interim or annual periods and that the correction of the error is not material to our 2013 consolidated financial statements 

income taxes have not been provided on approximately 13785 million of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2013 over which we have sufficient influence to control the distribution of such earnings and have determined that substantially all such earnings have been reinvested indefinitely these earnings could become subject to either or both federal income tax and foreign withholding tax if they are remitted as dividends if foreign earnings are loaned to any of our domestic companies or if we sell our investment in certain subsidiaries we estimate that repatriation of these foreign earnings would generate additional foreign withholding taxes of approximately 103 million us federal income taxes of approximately 319 million and state income taxes of approximately 30 million each after the assumed utilization of our available net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits

liquidity and capital resources 

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements offbalance sheet arrangements contingencies sources and uses of cash operations working capital and longterm assets and liabilities 

  

contractual obligations 

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt capital leases operating leases and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2013 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

 

  

  

  

 this table also excludes our pension obligations we expect to make cash contributions and future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements of approximately 407 million in 2014 this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2014 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations see note 11 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information on our pension obligations 

our balance of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 6257 million at december 31 2013 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months total cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at december 31 2013 include approximately 3841 million available in the united states in addition to cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments already on hand in the united states we have the ability to obtain cash in the united states by settling loans with our foreign subsidiaries in order to cover our domestic needs by utilizing existing credit facilities or through new bank loans or debt obligations 

we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt repurchases payments and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current debt agreements or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost 

  

it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition

in the normal course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us as required for transactions including but not limited to material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases utilities or customs guarantees our senior revolving credit facility includes a 400 million availability for the issuance of letters of credit a 02 million letter of credit was outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility as of december 31 2013 we also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our senior revolving credit facility of 58 million at december 31 2013 

as part of securing financing in the normal course of business we issued guarantees related to our receivable financing capital lease obligations equipment financing lines of credit and real estate mortgages which totaled approximately 771 million as of december 31 2013 we are also a guarantor of sci llc’s unsecured loan with smbc which had a balance of 2737 million as of december 31 2013 see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements 

for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and similarly incur expenses totaling 914 million as payments come due we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases letters of credit and guarantee arrangements see note 12 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

contingencies 

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to ip infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in economic damages bodily injury or property damage in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims 

  

we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

in addition to the above from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisers and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 12 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for possible contingencies related to legal matters see also part i item 1 “business—government regulation” for information on certain environmental matters 

sources and uses of cash 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures for strategic acquisitions and investments to repurchase our stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand and shortterm investments additionally as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

 

  

 our ability to service our longterm debt including our senior subordinated notes to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

  

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next twelve months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

during the ordinary course of business we evaluate our cash requirements and if necessary adjust our expenditures for inventory operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand during 2013 we paid 1552 million for capital expenditures while in 2012 we paid 2563 million our current projection for capital expenditures in 2014 is approximately 205 million to 225 million of which our current minimum commitment is approximately 535 million the capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives 

on october 10 2013 we entered into an 8000 million fiveyear senior revolving credit facility the new credit agreement amends and restates our prior agreement dated as of december 23 2011 and significantly increased our liquidity as described under “key financing and capital events—2013 financing events—amended and restated senior revolving credit facility” following entry into the new credit agreement we borrowed 1200 million of the 8000 million available under the new facility see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

cash management 

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

  

primary cash flow sources 

our longterm cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash our cash flows from operations is summarized as follows in millions 

 

 our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on among other factors our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets 

our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below 

working capital 

working capital calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs in addition our working capital may be affected by capital activities as part of our share repurchase program and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments our working capital including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 8910 million at december 31 2013 and has fluctuated between 8910 million and 6691 million over the last eight quarterends although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives for the year ended december 31 2013 our working capital was most significantly impacted by the retirement of our 1875 and 2625 notes amounts drawn on our senior revolving credit facility payments associated with our restructuring activities our capital expenditures and the repurchase of the company’s common stock see note 8 “longterm debt” note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” and note 9 “earnings per share and equity” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

  

longterm assets and liabilities 

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets and goodwill 

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves in general the annual funding of our foreign defined benefit pension plan obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions for additional information see note 11 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k and see note 15 “income taxes” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue although to a much lesser extent from manufacturing services provided to customers distributor revenue is recognized in various ways within the industry some recognize revenue upon sale to the distributor while others like us recognize revenue when the sale is made to the end customer additionally there can often be a lag in the data collection from distributors which may have an effect on our revenue recognition due to our high distributor sales revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy 

we recognize revenue on sales to oems distributors that are not entitled to returns and allowances and electronic manufacturing service providers net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

for products sold to distributors who are entitled to returns and allowances we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when we are informed by the distributor that it has resold the products to the enduser as a result of our inability to reliably estimate up front the effects of the returns and allowances with these distributors we defer the related revenue and gross margin on sales to these distributors until we are informed by the distributor that the products have been resold to the enduser although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including value added and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience our oem customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under our general agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized and are netted against revenues we review warranty and related claims activity and record adjustments as necessary 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period of two years at the time revenue is recognized we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales recorded as a component of cost of revenues in addition we also offer cash discounts to certain customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time generally 10 days after shipment we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues based on experience with each customer 

freight and handling costs are included in the cost of revenues and are recognized as period expenses during the period in which they are incurred 

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected enduser demand these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory which is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

deferred tax valuation allowance  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will more likely than not be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense we maintain a valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets and most of our foreign deferred tax assets 

i mpairment of longlived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our asset groups that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value with related gains recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

goodwill  we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows discount and longterm growth rates we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach whereby the fair value of the 

  

reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments the assumptions about future conditions include factors such as future revenues gross profits operating expenses and industry trends changes in these estimates based on evolving economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable actual future results may differ from those estimates we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analysis 

when evaluating goodwill for impairment we may initially perform a qualitative assessment which includes a review and analysis of certain quantitative factors to estimate if its reporting units’ fair values significantly exceed their carrying values when the estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value appears more likely than not to be less than its carrying value based on this qualitative assessment we continue to the first step of a two step impairment test 

the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets associated with that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets associate with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if during this second step we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

we have determined that our product families which are components of our operating segments constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill our product families are one level below the operating segments constituting individual businesses with our segment management conducting regular reviews of the operating results for each product family as of each acquisition date all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the acquired business included in a reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date 

our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of 2014 however identification of a triggering event may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods 

defined benefit pension plans and related benefits  we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our nonus employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs and estimated withdrawal liabilities are determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates for plan obligations assumed rates of return on pension plan assets and assumed rates of compensation increase for employees participating in the plans these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment and consultation with actuaries considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans as of december 31 2013 a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately 419 million 

contingencies  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

at december 31 2013 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 9422 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 4320 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 5102 million balance on our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2013 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately 26 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase 

to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures from an accounting and economic perspective however given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the united states dollar as a normal part of the reporting process our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor we have increased our revenue expense and capital purchases in japanese yen thus increasing the effects of this translation 

we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a nonfunctional currency changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged the notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2013 and 2012 was 1017 million and 1973 million respectively our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies including japanese yen euros malaysian ringgit philippines peso singapore dollars canadian dollars swiss francs chinese renminbi czech koruna and british pounds sterling due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the us dollar for example we determined that based on a hypothetical weightedaverage change of 10 in currency exchange rates our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately 379 million as of december 31 2013 assuming no offsetting hedge positions

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the exchange act based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f that occurred during the fiscal year ended december 31 2013 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control—integrated framework 1992  we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2013 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” of this report

in general we have maintained longterm relationships with our key customers sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but do not require minimum purchase commitments most of our oem customers negotiate 

  

pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year while our other customers including electronic manufacturer service providers and distributors generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of endmarkets including computing automotive electronics consumer electronics industrial electronics wireless communications networking military aerospace and medical for the years ended december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we had no sales to customers including distributors that accounted for 10 or more of our total consolidated revenues prior to 2011 sales to one of our distributors avnet inc represented 10 or more of total consolidated revenues as follows 13 11 and 11 for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively revenues for our application products group and standard products group include distributor sales to avnet inc 

for the year ended december 31 2012 aggregate revenue from our five largest customers by revenue including distributors for our application products group standard products group and sanyo semiconductor products group comprised approximately 30  39 and 42 of total revenue for each respective operating segment the loss of certain of these customers or distributors may have a material adverse effect on the operations of the respective segment 

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period of two years generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days prior to shipment for custom products without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog” below 

  

endmarkets for our products 

the following table sets forth our principal endmarkets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each endmarket during 2012 sample applications for our products and representative oem customers and endusers 

 

   

 oems direct sales to oems accounted for approximately 55 of our revenues in 2012 56 of our revenues in 2011 and 46 of our revenues in 2010 the increase from 2010 to 2011 was driven by the significantly higher mix of oem revenue from our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor in 2011 these customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as continental automotive systems samsung electric panasonic delta and hella we focus on three types of oems multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core oem customers the target market customers in the communications power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are oems that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our oem customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 38 of our revenues in 2012 37 of our revenues in 2011 and 45 of our revenues in 2010 the decrease from 2010 to 2011 was driven by significantly lower mix of distributors from our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor in 2011 our distributors which include avnet world peace os electronics arrow and wt microelectronics resell to midsized and smaller oems and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with certain of our distributors contain stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns due to current limitations on the feasibility of estimating the up front effect of returns and allowances with these distributors we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to these distributors until these distributors resell the product as a result sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 7 of our revenues in 2012 7 of our revenues in 2011 and 9 of our revenues in 2010 our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are flextronics jabil sanmina benchmark electronic and hk towada electronics  these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for oems originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many oems now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace generally our electronic manufacturing service customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 17 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for revenues by geographic locations 

manufacturing operations 

we operate frontend wafer site facilities located in belgium canada czech republic japan malaysia and the united states and backend assembly and test site facilities located in canada china japan malaysia philippines thailand and vietnam in addition to these frontend and backend manufacturing operations our 

  

facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities we operate all of our manufacturing facilities directly except in the case of our joint venture in leshan china 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we committed to a plan to close our wafer manufacturing facility located in aizu japan the “aizu plan” under the aizu plan all of the aizu japan production and operations have been transferred to other wafer fabrication facilities as of december 31 2012 and we expect to fully exit the facility during 2013 the aizu plan was undertaken as part of our overall drive for operational efficiencies and is in line with an ongoing strategy aimed at migrating inhouse production to large high volume facilities and investing in more advanced wafer technologies see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of certain information related to the aizu shutdown 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we committed to a plan to close our probe assembly and test operations located in ayutthaya thailand and to partially close our facility in bang pa in thailand collectively the “thailand plans” as a result of damage caused to those facilities by the 2011 flooding in that region and the significant costs associated with the recovery and reconstruction of the affected facilities under the thailand plans a majority of the ayutthaya and bang pa in production was transferred to other companyowned facilities and to certain external subcontractors during the year ended december 31 2012 see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of certain information related to the thailand plans 

  

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities the sizes of the locations represent the approximate gross square footage of each site’s building and include among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

 

  

  

  

 we operate an assembly and test operations facility in leshan china this facility is owned by a joint venture company leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited “leshan” of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is formerly a stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder 

  

provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 70 of leshan’s production capacity in 2012 70 in 2011 70 in 2010 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 70 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2013 in 2012 we incurred 01 million of underutilization charges in 2011 and 2010 we incurred no underutilization charges as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan we supply die used in the production process 

the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations in june 2002 we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to 2310 million in semiconductor operations which is in addition to the 2780 million originally approved in 2004 we committed to make additional capital contributions of approximately 250 million to this joint venture by 2012 subject to market conditions as of december 31 2012 we had made additional capital contributions of approximately 280 million we have no obligation to make future capital contributions 

we use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including amkor utac unisem tower jcap umc and tsmc accounted for approximately 23 23 and 29 of our manufacturing costs in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

raw materials 

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers gold copper and lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a justintime basis and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table which shows commitments contingencies and indemnities in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations— liquidity and capital resources” under the heading “contractual obligations” included elsewhere in this report from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply increased demand in the industry or certain other factors 

sales marketing and distribution 

as of december 31 2012 our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 1100 professionals operating out of approximately 50 offices which serve customers in approximately 70 countries we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective internetbased applications support from our laboratories in czech republic china and the united states through online connectivity applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions we continue to monitor our freight and logistical support operations for potential cost savings 

patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights 

we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor ® and our on logo as well as under the licensed trademark and logo of sanyo semiconductor which we are able to utilize for a three year period from the acquisition date with some extension of time for certain products that are manufactured but not yet sold by the end of 2013 we own rights to a number of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other ip directly related to and important to our business in connection with our 1999 recapitalization motorola 

  

assigned licensed or sublicensed to us as the case may be certain ip to support and continue the operation of our business we also acquired or were licensed or sublicensed to a significant amount of ip including patents and patent applications in connection with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor in connection with the ip received from the sanyo semiconductor transaction we received a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from general unknown and certain known infringement claims from third parties as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 6200 us and foreign patents and approximately 3000 patent applications pending worldwide our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2013 to 2032 none of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business additionally we have rights to more than 330 registered and common law trademarks our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our ip rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents copyrights and other ip rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 

seasonality 

historically our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related endmarkets consisting of a stronger second half of the year for consumer products as compared to the first half of the year in 2012 as a result of global and industry economic conditions we did not experience the traditional cyclical pattern during the second half of the year in recent years the industry has also been affected by significant shifts in consumer demand due to economic or other factors which has resulted in volatility in order patterns and lead times sudden shifts in product demand and periodic production overcapacity we have in the past experienced substantial quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenues and operating results and in the future could continue to experience short term periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

backlog 

our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are predominantly booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our electronic data interface customers in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times for those shipments to distributors who are allowed sales return rights and allowances we record revenues on a “sellthrough” basis thus backlog comprised of orders from these distributors will not result in revenues until these distributors sell the products ordered during 2012 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 82 and 92 of actual revenues during such quarter which is lower on a percentage basis than prior years this is generally due to the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor as that business has a lower backlog as compared to the historical on semiconductor business as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases customers tend to order products further in advance and as a result backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 

in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 

we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 

  

competition 

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for generalpurpose semiconductor products like ours is highly competitive although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fully customized ics as well as customers who develop their own ic products see part i item 1a “risk factors— trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” located elsewhere in this report for additional information 

in comparison several competitors noted below are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions the following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments

companysponsored research and development costs in 2012 2011 and 2010 were 3675 million 127 of revenue 3625 million 105 of revenue and 2480 million 107 of revenue respectively our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications during 2012 research and development costs increased as a result of our growing usage of engineering materials and depreciation for new capital projects and design software 

government regulation 

our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 

our headquarters in phoenix arizona is located on property that is a “superfund” site a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to cleanup activities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act motorola and now freescale semiconductor inc “freescale” have been actively involved in the cleanup of onsite solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and offsite contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola retained responsibility for this contamination and motorola and freescale have agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter 

our former manufacturing location in aizu japan is located on property where soil and ground water contamination has been detected we believe that the contamination originally occurred during a time when the facility was operated by a prior owner we are working with local authorities to determine the appropriate 

  

remediation actions and expect remediation costs subject to certain limitations to be indemnified pursuant to an agreement between us and the prior owner or covered by insurance subject to a deductible based on information available any net costs to us in connection with this matter are not expected to be material 

our manufacturing facility in the czech republic has ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that this facility was operated by governmentowned entities the remediation project consists primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located onsite and offsite with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded the government of the czech republic has agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries subject to specified limitations for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination based upon the information available we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 

our design center in east greenwich rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination when we purchased the east greenwich facility we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property based on the information available we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

as a result of the acquisition of amis we are a “primary responsible party” to an environmental remediation and cleanup at amis’s former corporate headquarters in santa clara california costs incurred by amis include implementation of the cleanup plan operations and maintenance of remediation systems and other project management costs however amis’s former parent company a subsidiary of nippon mining contractually agreed to indemnify amis and us for any obligation relating to environmental remediation and cleanup at this location based on the information available we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and liability for currently known environmental conditions to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects it is possible however that future developments including changes in laws and regulations government policies customer specification personnel and physical property conditions including currently undiscovered contamination could lead to material costs 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 20000 employees worldwide of which approximately 2300 employees were in the united states none of our employees in the united states are covered by collective bargaining agreements certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements ie japan and belgium or similar arrangements or are represented by workers councils for information regarding employee risk associated with our international operations see part i item 1a “risk factors— trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” elsewhere in this report of the total number of our employees as of december 31 2012 approximately 16000 were engaged in manufacturing approximately 1100 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization which includes customer service approximately 700 were engaged in administration and approximately 2200 were engaged in research and development

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

from time to time we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and incur additional operating losses in the future 

at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses reduced enduser demand price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity the effects of natural disasters such as the flooding in thailand or the japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011 and other factors have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our business in order to remain profitable we must continue to successfully implement our business plan and examine and implement potentially advantageous cost reduction initiatives 

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns and upturns 

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and as a result is subject to significant downturns and upturns the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices in the event of such a downturn our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges on the other hand significant upturns have led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in the event of such an upturn we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials or locate suitable thirdparty suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected we may also not be able to balance our expansion activities and actual demand in such an environment the overbuilding of capacity and excess increases of inventory by us and other companies can result in overcapacity in the industry and general price erosion 

in some ways we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience them in the future we cannot accurately predict the timing of the current and future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these conditions might be these future conditions in the semiconductor industry could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

economic conditions including those related to the credit markets may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in fluctuations to and reductions in consumer and commercial spending from time to time among other things such uncertainties may result in lower orders from our customers for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions reduced spending has in the past driven us and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which results in a negative impact on gross profit volatility in global economic conditions may adversely and materially affect our industry business and results of operations and we cannot accurately predict volatility or how severe and prolonged any downturn or recovery might be in addition to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected our business and results of operations could be adversely and materially affected moreover volatility in revenues as a result of unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our short term and long term strategies 

furthermore the united states and global credit markets could experience renewed financial turmoil if the past pressures on credit were renewed or we experience an additional global downturn we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all and we may not be able to refinance if necessary any outstanding debt when due all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures for the immediate future if our operating results falter and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition global financial uncertainty affecting the financial and other markets could impact our business in a number of other ways including causing 1 our customers and consumers in general to defer purchases 2 our customers difficulties in obtaining sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us 3 our key suppliers to become capacity constrained or insolvent resulting in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and 4 our key suppliers to require acceleration of payments to them or our customers to delay payments to us any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses incurring additional debt assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 

in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts we face risks resulting from the expansion of our operations through acquisitions including but not limited to 1 the difficulty of integrating aligning and coordinating organizations which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures 2 risks of entering new semiconductor markets or regions of the world in which we have limited experience 3 risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies particularly if such company is lacking adequate financial reporting and internal control systems or possesses systems that are materially different from ours 4 the risk that our due diligence in the acquisition process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities that are in existence at the time of our acquisition 5 the risk that our existing or prospective customers or customers of the acquired business may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions as we integrate new businesses and companies into our business or that they may seek to change their existing business relationships 6 challenges in achieving 

  

strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions including difficulties in entering into new market segments in which we are not experienced 7 the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets 8 difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses and 9 negative pressure on gross margins resulting from increased operating and restructuring costs associated with the target 

in addition current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us and as a result we could lose key employees these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel in connection with a transaction key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in the form of changeincontrol agreements acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equitybased compensation rights further as a result of our acquisitions we may assume liabilities from the target’s current employee benefit plans that may require us to bring plan documentation into compliance with current law including ensuring that plans are adequately funded 

in connection with our acquisition activity we are required by generally accepted accounting principles and sec rules and regulations to integrate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or if they do have independent audited financial statements such statements may not be prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems which could materially impair our ability to obtain or prepare necessary financial information concerning such businesses in a format required to allow proper integration with our systems and financials in addition immediately after an acquisition and until such time as we are able to fully integrate an acquired business into our financial statements we may be dependent on the acquired business’ financial controls and systems for reporting and other financial information including projections and goals for such acquired business we may not be able to successfully prepare and file required financial statements or other financial information for the acquired business or to integrate the acquired business into our financial controls and systems and our consolidated financial statements in a timely manner failure to prepare accurate financial reports for our acquired businesses in a timely manner in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could cause material inaccuracies in our financial statements and sec filings which could result in the necessity to restate our financials or lead to unknown liabilities and possibly result in a material impact on our stock price 

the integration of newly acquired businesses will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management in particular the integration of sanyo semiconductor has and will continue to require significant internal and external coordination the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships moreover even if we were able to fully integrate a new acquisition’s business operations and other assets successfully there can be no assurance that such integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from the acquisition or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time delays in integrating our acquisitions which could be caused by factors outside of our control could adversely affect the intended benefits of the acquisitions to our business financial results financial condition and stock price 

in connection with an acquisition it is possible that we may anticipate tax savings through integration of the newly acquired business into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure as with any estimate it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be incorrect 

we review goodwill associated with our acquisitions for impairment at least on an annual basis see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 2 “significant accounting policies— goodwill” of the notes to our consolidated audited financial statements 

  

located elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information about goodwill in the current year and in the past we recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions factors we consider important that could result in a subsequent impairment to goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues andor increased costs we may have further material goodwill impairments further material goodwill impairments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

in addition we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results for example in the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor and related assets in early 2011 “sanyo semiconductor transaction” a portion of the purchase price was financed by a sevenyear loan with an adjustable interest rate from sanyo electric to sci llc the loan agreement contains customary events of default as well as representations warranties and covenants but does not contain any financial or negative covenants it is possible that factors outside of our control including but not limited to increases in interest rates and loss of key customers could adversely affect the intended benefits from the sanyo semiconductor transaction but we will continue to have a repayment obligation under the loan agreement 

our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization and realizing expected synergies from acquisitions 

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing for instance if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits in addition increased competition and other factors beyond our control including economic factors may lead to price erosion lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

moreover we believe that we will need to improve the historic margin levels of the business and assets we acquired in connection with the sanyo semiconductor transaction and successfully execute on available opportunities in order to realize the intended benefits of this transaction while we anticipate that the continuing integration of the sanyo semiconductor business including certain cost reduction measures taken could improve its historic margin levels we may not be able to benefit fully from such actions furthermore sanyo electric agreed to provide certain operational support to sanyo semiconductor for a period of time relating to costs expenses and other amounts associated with seconded employees transition services and certain property leases this operational support ended on december 31 2012 while we have continued to take steps to reduce the cost structure the expiration of this operational support is expected to directly impact the margin levels of the sanyo semiconductor business see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on the sanyo semiconductor operational support 

the failure to implement as well as the completion and impact of our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions including restructuring activities could adversely affect our business 

from time to time we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to among other things significant downturns in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in the 

  

past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs have been primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on restructuring activities 

we also often undertake restructuring activities in connection with our business acquisitions which can result in significant charges including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges 

we cannot assure you that our current restructuring plans including the 2013 sanyo semiconductor voluntary retirement program or future cost reduction initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented or will materially impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition 

for additional information regarding our profitability enhancement programs and cost reduction measures see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” and note 20 “subsequent events” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 continue to aggressively manage maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 further expand our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 rationalize our manufacturing operations 7 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 8 reduce selling and administrative expenses 9 manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands 10 actively manage working capital 11 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 12 integrate newly acquired products manufacturing capabilities and sales channels we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other things to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our ip portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these factors and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities the impact of natural disasters increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

  

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process and often requires significant capital investment additionally expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers including changes due to evolving consumer preferences international political developments influencing enduser preferences and natural disasters or other extraordinary events that impact our customers or endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects moreover we may make significant investment in new products that may not be profitable or that do not have margins as high as we anticipated or experienced historically 

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days for custom products without incurring a significant penalty we routinely generate inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

  

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for semiconductor components is highly competitive as a result of current economic uncertainty competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness many of our competitors particularly larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex ics we also face competition from manufacturers of ics asics and fully customized ics as well as from customers who develop their own ic products 

we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers tablets industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends 

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other things capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities including as a part of our cost reduction measures and in reaction to manmade and natural disasters such as the 2011 flooding in thailand upgrading or expanding existing facilities changing our process technologies or uncertainty as a result of the acquisition and integration of manufacturing facilities acquired as a result of our acquisition activities any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

  

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing information technology and equipment to remain competitive the failure inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and such capital expenditures and commitments as well as other commitments may materially decrease our liquidity 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices we maintain certain of our own manufacturing assembly and test facilities which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume however there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and utilize these new technologies there also is no assurance that the new technologies we do develop and utilize will be sufficient to support our business operations and strategies or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such new technologies 

we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency any such implementation however can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or in some instances to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned in the case of abandonment we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

in the recent past we have undertaken various and material cost reduction measures which we believe have been largely successful however these reductions and any future reductions may unintentionally affect our ability to remain competitive in efficiency and productivity ultimately we may be forced to increase our future capital expenditures in unexpected ways to meet our operational needs in among other areas manufacturing information technology and equipment we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make timely and necessary investments in the areas discussed above or other areas we have not identified 

although we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs and expenses related to the sanyo semiconductor transaction we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with cash on hand shortterm investments and funds from external borrowings will be adequate to operate our business and otherwise satisfy our capital needs given these capital expenditures and other costs associated with sanyo semiconductor if we are unable to generate expected cash flows our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives related to the sanyo semiconductor operations there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 

we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and other business disruptions 

our worldwide operations are subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions from time to time which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial reporting and condition we are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods hurricanes typhoons droughts and other extreme weather conditions earthquakes tsunamis volcanoes and similar natural disasters as well as power outages power shortages telecommunications failures industrial accidents and similar events such events can cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property including our books and financial and corporate records and data and related internal controls and can also have significant direct and indirect consequences for example such events can negatively impact revenues and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event such costs may include expenses to 

  

restore production or to move production to other facilities including incremental capital expenditures and costs for expedited shipping expenses incurred with a shutdown of the damaged facility including employee severance payments and other unusual costs and expenses such as fixed asset impairments inventory writedowns charges relating to cancellation of purchase orders for excess materials and charges for restoration and recovery work overall costs may also be impacted by other factors such as the underabsorption of our manufacturing and operating support overhead in the case of our facility in roznov czech republic that manufactures silicon wafers used by a number of our facilities a natural or manmade disaster operational disruption or other extraordinary event that impacted the facility or regional infrastructure would have a substantial adverse effect on our ability to produce a number of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business revenues costs andor prospects if we are unable to effectively source silicon from qualified third parties to replace the production loss such events may also affect the infrastructure of the country in which the event occurs causing water damage power outages transportation delays and restrictions public health issues and economic instability and disrupting local and international supply chains as a result we could experience shortages of and interruptions in supply and increased prices for components that we source from companies located in or with operations in any such country as well as from other suppliers whose supply chains may similarly be affected such shortages and interruptions may also affect our ability to timely deliver our products to customers and as a result our customers may seek substitute products from other manufacturers consequences such as power outages including any rolling blackouts or other anticipated problems could adversely affect our business by among other things interrupting our production capacity harming our internal operations limiting our ability to communicate with our customers and suppliers and limiting our customers’ ability to sell or use our products in addition damage or destruction to our property including our books and financial and corporate records and data could adversely affect our ability to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the historical and future reporting of our financial results and our ability to integrate the financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies responding to natural disasters and their consequences will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above such insurance may be subject to deductible and coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects in addition the continued integration of the acquired sanyo semiconductor business requires significant coordination and we cannot assure you that our existing customer relationships or sanyo semiconductor’s prior customer relationships will not be materially and adversely affected as a result of uncertainty in connection with or other factors relating to the combined entity 

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner the costs of our raw materials increase significantly their quality deteriorates or the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including polysilicon silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of 

  

sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

in addition for some of our products we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt production in material ways in addition we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect in any such case arranging for replacement contractors can be time consuming and costly and we may encounter startup difficulties 

regulations that impose disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in our products will result in additional cost and expense and could result in other significant adverse effects 

rules adopted by the sec implementing the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in our products compliance with these rules is likely to result in additional cost and expense including for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities these rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our semiconductor devices as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals or components that can be used in our products there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such metals or components in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices the cost of compliance to our service providers foundries subcontractors and suppliers could also be passed along to us resulting in higher prices for the materials or components we use in our products also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the metals used in our products we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the asiapacific region the americas and europe similarly we maintain significant operations in these regions in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the last few fiscal years we have benefited from relatively low effective tax rates because most of our income has been earned and reinvested in jurisdictions outside the us our effective tax rate is uncertain on an ongoing basis changes to income tax regulations in the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could under our existing tax structure significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operations and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition business combinations and investment transactions changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes and changes in available tax credits could increase our future effective tax rate changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by our increasing or decreasing operations in jurisdictions with higher or lower rates as well as by changes in rates or the laws that determine when we are subject to taxation in a specific jurisdiction 

we hold a significant amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt repurchases payments and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations through borrowings under our current debt agreements or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

other activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange for instance while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

our success both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and financial personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive in addition from time to time we have announced 

  

certain cost reductions that included the freezing of salaries and elimination of bonuses mandatory unpaid time off factory shutdowns and reduction in personnel we also establish performance criteria for awards to officers and employees under bonus and other incentive plans and programs that may not be satisfied these measures as well as any future measures could negatively affect morale and lead to unintended employee attrition at all levels of our organization moreover we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel and our existing employment agreements do not require the employee to continue to work for us 

as employee incentives we have issued common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time rsu’s with timebased vesting and performancebased awards any difficulty relating to obtaining stockholder approval of new or amendments to equity compensation plans could limit our ability to issue these types of awards our stock price at times has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of certain of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

we rely on various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered ip assets patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies these laws and regulations are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts additionally some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications with respect to our ip generally we cannot assure you that 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective ip protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty ip rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such ip rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for ip we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

 

  

  

   

  

 we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

we also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to ip arising out of our research 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

our ability to enforce our patents trademarks copyrights software licenses and other ip is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged ip rights 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

all industries including the semiconductor industry are subject to legal claims with and without merit including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general we are involved in a variety of legal matters most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers employment and labor and ip we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however defense and settlement costs can be substantial even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

as mentioned above from time to time we have been or may in the future be involved in securities litigation or litigation arising from our acquisitions we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation matter in which we are a party these types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future in addition we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions will not subject us to additional litigation see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for more information on our legal proceedings 

  

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards 

like most publiclytraded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm as we continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future 

there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future failure to comply with sox including delaying or failing to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of this transaction and the trading price of our common stock may decline in addition if we fail to remedy any material weakness our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements our financial statements may be materially inaccurate our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other things regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization and spinout from motorola we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities 

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

 

  

  

   

  

 warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process requiring production in a tightly controlled clean environment minute impurities in our manufacturing materials contaminants in the manufacturing environment manufacturing equipment failures and other defects can cause our products to be noncompliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design oems are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage if any and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved in certain instances we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective 

new legal requirements particularly with respect to health care reform could increase the cost of our employee benefits and adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations 

we incur significant costs to maintain competitive employee benefits to attract and retain our highly skilled personnel changes to the regulatory environment with respect to these benefits could adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations in particular the health care reform legislation enacted by the us congress is intended to result in significant changes to the us health care system this legislation may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of the new healthcare regulations and may impair our ability to provide the same level of coverage 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could damage our reputation and harm our business and operating results 

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses illegal hacking or acts of vandalism or terrorism additionally the proprietary sensitive or confidential information we manage and store may be subject to accidental loss misuse inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination our security measures andor those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales 

  

manufacturing distribution or other critical functions any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information cause an interruption in our operations result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data result in a violation of privacy or other laws expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation which could harm our business and operating results 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

despite the fact that we have recently retired some of our past debt obligations with existing cash flow we are still highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations in addition we may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments from time to time the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness from time to time may limit us and our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next 12 months if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities moreover the debt we may incur from time to time may require collateral to secure such indebtedness which would place our assets at risk as well as limit our flexibility related to such assets ultimately we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all and we may need to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 

  

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

our debt agreements from time to time may contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately which could cross default other indebtedness we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements from time to time may contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to then current stockholders 

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may impact the value of our common stock a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter in addition to the other factors described above factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors some of which are beyond our control 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had significant variance and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

 item 2 properties 

our corporate headquarters as well as certain design center and research and development operations are located in approximately 14 million square feet of building space on property that we own in phoenix arizona we also lease properties around the world for use as sales offices design centers research and development labs warehouses logistic centers trading offices and manufacturing support the size andor location of these properties change from time to time based on business requirements we operate distribution centers which are leased or contracted through a third party in locations throughout asia europe and the americas see part i item 1 “business—manufacturing operations” located elsewhere in this report for information on properties used in our manufacturing operations while these facilities are primarily used in manufacturing operations they also include office utility laboratory warehouse and unused space additionally we own research and development facilities located in belgium canada china the czech republic france germany india ireland japan korea romania the slovak republic switzerland taiwan and the united states our joint venture in leshan china also owns manufacturing warehouse laboratory office and other unused space 

  

certain of our properties are subject to encumbrances such as mortgages and liens see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information in addition due to local law restrictions the land upon which our facilities are located in certain foreign locations are subject to varying longterm leases 

we believe that our facilities around the world whether owned or leased are well maintained however significant upturns have from time to time led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

our common stock is traded under the symbol “onnn” on the nasdaq global select market the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock for the fiscal periods indicated as reported by the nasdaq global select market 

 

 as of february 22 2013 there were approximately 262 holders of record of our common stock and 449492111 shares of common stock outstanding 

we have neither declared nor paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our initial public offering our future dividend policy with respect to our common stock will depend upon our earnings capital requirements financial condition debt restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 

  

our senior revolving credit facility permits us to pay cash dividends to our common stockholders if after giving effect thereto the senior leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the credit agreement does not exceed 250 to 100 as of december 31 2012 we were within the required senior leverage ratio and therefore permitted to pay cash dividends see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion of our revolving credit facility

industry overview 

according to wsts an industry research firm worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 2916 billion in 2012 a decrease of approximately 26 from 2995 billion in 2011 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our serviceable addressable market since 2008 

 

  

  

   

worldwide semiconductor industry sales declined 27 in 2008 declined 90 in 2009 grew 318 in 2010 grew 04 in 2011 and declined 26 in 2012 following a pattern associated with the financial crisis subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty the decrease of 26 from 2011 to 2012 is related to global macroeconomic conditions within the semiconductor industry affecting sales in all geographic regions  sales in our sam grew in 2008 reflecting the expanded markets we now serve with the acquisitions of amis and catalyst that exceeded the impact of any price declines sales in our sam increased to 856 billion in 2009 to 1102 billion in 2010 decreased to 1074 billion in 2011 and decreased to 1037 billion in 2012 the decrease of approximately 34 from 1074 billion in 2011 to 1037 billion in 2012 is consistent with the trend in the worldwide semiconductor market the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our sam of approximately 41 for the next three years these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 

recent results 

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 were 28949 million a decrease of approximately 159 from 34423 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the majority of which was due to lower revenues generated from our sanyo semiconductor products group and a weakened demand environment associated with less favorable global economic conditions  during 2012 we reported a net loss of 906 million compared to net income of 116 million in 2011 our gross margin increased by approximately 360 basis points to 329 in 2012 from 293 in 2011 primarily due to an absence of 1387 million in expenses related to our sanyo semiconductor products group that were recorded in 2011 which did not reoccur in 2012 

during 2012 we recognized 1653 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges the majority of our restructuring and cost saving initiatives were focused on our sanyo semiconductor products group the sanyo semiconductor products group experienced revenue and financial performance declines greater than our expectations and the cyclical declines in our other operating segments these declines were a result of a combination of factors which included the continued impact from the october 2011 thailand flooding which permanently damaged one of our sanyo semiconductor products group’s manufacturing locations a softening of the japanese consumer market and to a lesser extent political tensions between japan and china which began to impact our revenue levels in the second half of 2012 during 2012 we completed a significant reduction in workforce in the sanyo semiconductor products group to help partially offset these revenue declines and recorded 359 million of related net restructuring charges for this program however these revenue and performance declines continued into the second half of the year which caused us to reevaluate the longterm projections and related incremental costs expected to be incurred in order to achieve acceptable operating results for the sanyo semiconductor products group as a result of these collective factors in the fourth quarter of 2012 we determined that it was necessary to evaluate the recoverability of the longlived assets of the segment this evaluation concluded that an impairment charge of 1260 million was required to adjust the carrying value of the longlived assets to their respective fair values additionally in the first quarter of 2013 we initiated another voluntary retirement program for the sanyo semiconductor products group to achieve further costs savings and align expenses to our expected revenue levels for the segment for further information on the 2013 voluntary retirement program see note 20 “subsequent events” of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this form 10k

outlook 

on semiconductor q1 2013 outlook 

based upon product booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we estimate that our revenues will be approximately 645 million to 685 million in the first quarter of 2013 backlog levels for the first quarter of 2013 represent approximately 80 to 85 of our anticipated first quarter 2013 revenues we 

  

estimate average selling prices for the first quarter of 2013 will be down approximately 2 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 for the first quarter of 2013 we estimate that gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be approximately 305 to 325 

business overview 

we are driving innovation in energy efficient electronics our broad portfolio of power and signal management logic discrete and custom devices helps customers efficiently solve their design challenges in automotive communications computing consumer industrial led lighting medical militaryaerospace and power applications we design manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products our power management semiconductor components control convert protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our custom asics use analog dsp mixedsignal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive medical military aerospace consumer and industrial customers’ unique products our data management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all types of electronic devices these various products fall into the logic analog and discrete categories used by wsts 

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have caused demand to strengthen production volumes have historically stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand reaches levels above capacity production capabilities shortages begin to occur which typically causes pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

new product innovation 

our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications as always it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position ourselves for continued growth as a result we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity logic analog memory and discrete products we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 

business and macroeconomic environment influence on cost savings and restructuring activities 

the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced economic contractions in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions we believe the business environment continues to experience significant economic uncertainty and volatility which has contributed to the current market weakness in our industry these factors combined with other events including the impact of the march 2011 japan earthquake and resulting tsunami the october 2011 flooding in thailand and the heightened political and economic tensions between japan and china have either impacted us directly or have affected our customers and suppliers which in turn has affected our business including sales production capacity and results of operations for both our sanyo semiconductor products group and other reporting segments although we regard certain of these issues as temporary our continuing outlook will ultimately affect our future emphasis on marketing to various industries our future research and development efforts into new product lines and our segments in general 

  

due to the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor industry we continually evaluate our cost structure and as necessary implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our financial performance in connection with these programs we aim to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure our programs include efforts to 

 

  

  

  

  

 we have taken significant actions during 2012 to align our overall cost structure with our expected revenue levels in addition to the actions executed in 2012 as revenue and operating results have declined more than anticipated we intend to implement further cost reduction measures in 2013 related to our sanyo semiconductor products group including a voluntary retirement program for certain of our sanyo semiconductor products group subsidiaries which is expected to reduce the employment levels at these subsidiaries by approximately 500 to 600 employees furthermore we are continuing to review our capital investments and other expenditures to align our spending and capacity with our current sales and manufacturing projections see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” and note 20 “subsequent events” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of certain details relating to our recent cost saving actions 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 in millions 

 

   

 revenues 

revenues were 28949 million 34423 million and 23134 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease from 2011 to 2012 was most pronounced in our sanyo semiconductor products group with our other operating segments experiencing revenue declines as a result of a weakened demand environment associated with less favorable global economic conditions as previously discussed our sanyo semiconductor products group was impacted by the continued effects of the october 2011 thailand flood a softening of the japanese consumer market and to a lesser extent political tensions between japan and china which began to impact revenue levels in the second half of 2012 

for the year ended december 31 2012 we experienced changes in volume and mix which resulted in a decrease of approximately 112 as well as a decline in average selling prices of approximately 47 as compared to 2011 

the increase in revenues from 2010 to 2011 was due to revenues generated from the 2011 acquisition of our sanyo semiconductor products group combined with increases in revenue of 686 million from our application products group and standard products group excluding the effects of certain acquisitions revenues from our application products group and standard products group improved due to a 62 increase from volume and changes in mix which was partially offset by a 20 decrease in average selling prices 

we changed our organizational structure during the fourth quarter of 2012 and previously reported information has been recast to reflect our current organizational structure see note 17 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a further discussion regarding our reportable segments revenues by reportable segment for each of the three years below were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

   

revenues from the application products group decreased by 1263 million or approximately 11 from 2011 to 2012 and increased from 2010 to 2011 by 923 million or approximately 9 the 2012 decrease in revenue can be attributed to a decrease in revenue from asic products of 709 million or approximately 11 a decrease in revenue from analog products of 203 million or approximately 5 and a decrease in foundry services revenue of 134 million or approximately 49 with the remainder of the decrease primarily associated with our highfrequency products in 2011 the increase in revenue is attributed to 503 million in revenues from products related to the isbu and sdt acquisitions as well as an increase of approximately 7 in revenues from asic products which was attributable to stronger demand in the mixed signal automotive endmarket these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue from high frequency products of approximately 14 which was driven by lower demand in industrial and networking endmarkets 

revenues from the standard products group decreased by 1318 million or approximately 11 from 2011 to 2012 and decreased from 2010 to 2011 by 237 million or approximately 2 the 2012 decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to decreases in discrete products of 741 million or approximately 15 a decrease in analog products revenue of 281 million or approximately 9 and a decrease in revenue from memory products of 251 million or approximately 31 with the remaining decrease primarily associated with our tmos products in 2011 the decrease in revenue is a result of decreases of approximately 10 in revenue from our analog standard products and a decrease in revenue of approximate 2 from tmos standard products 

revenues from the sanyo semiconductor products group decreased by 2893 million or approximately 27 from 2011 to 2012 due to the continued impact from the october 2011 thailand flooding which permanently damaged one of our sanyo semiconductor products group’s manufacturing locations a softening of the japanese consumer market and to a lesser extent political tensions between japan and china which began to impact revenue levels in the second half of 2012 

revenues from the sanyo semiconductor products group were 10603 million million during 2011 these revenues are the result of our january 1 2011 sanyo semiconductor transaction 

revenues by geographic area as a percentage of total revenues were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

 for additional information see the table of revenues by geographic location included in note 17 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor in 2011 there has been a shift in our global revenues to the japan and asiapacific regions with combined revenues from these regions totaling 20391 million in 2012 and 24532 million in 2011 for approximately 70 of our total revenues in 2012 and approximately 71 of our total revenues in 2011 which following our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor has increased from approximately 62 of total revenues from the same region in 2010 

  

gross profit 

our gross profit by reportable segment in each of the three years below was as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

  

 our gross profit was 9519 million 10088 million and 9560 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the gross profit decrease of 569 million or approximately 6 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily attributable to decreases in gross profit in our application products group and standard products group partially offset by a 640 million increase in gross profit for our sanyo semiconductor products group largely due to charges incurred during 2011 for the stepup in fair market value of inventory and noncash manufacturing expenses which were not incurred during 2012 

the gross profit increase from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to the sanyo semiconductor transaction and an increase in our application products group driven by the impact of our isbu and sdt acquisitions which contributed a combined 272 million in additional gross profit in 2011 as compared to 2010 the increase was partially offset by decreases in the standard products group as sales mix and volume improvements during 2011 were outpaced by selling price declines 

gross margin increased to approximately 329 during 2012 compared to approximately 293 during 2011 this increase is related to the increase in gross profit from our sanyo semiconductor products group the increase in gross profit is a direct result of certain expenses which we recorded during 2011 and for which we did not incur expenses in 2012 the 2011 expenses included the following i the impact of the stepup in fair market value of inventory of 583 million and ii 804 million of noncash manufacturing expenses gross margin was also impacted by cost savings from our restructuring activities as discussed below further offset by volume and revenue declines 

the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to lower gross margin from our sanyo semiconductor products group which included charges associated with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor for the application products group and standard products group the gross margin decline was due to lower average selling prices combined with the impact of lower factory utilization and higher commodity costs which negatively impacted the gross margin for each segment 

operating expenses 

research and development expenses were 3675 million 3625 million and 2480 million representing approximately 127 105 and 107 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively research and development expenses increased by 50 million or approximately 14 from 2011 to 2012 this increase is due to increased costs related to the usage of engineering materials and depreciation for new capital projects and design software the increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily attributed to increased expenses associated with research and development activities associated with our sanyo semiconductor transaction combined with an increase in head count during 2011 as compared to 2010 

  

selling and marketing expenses were 1809 million 1951 million and 1456 million representing approximately 62 57 and 63 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease of 142 million or approximately 73 from 2011 to 2012 is primarily attributable to planned reductions in workforce reductions in bonus and sharebased compensation expenses reduced travel costs and a reduction in outside services the increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily attributed to increased expenses associated with our ongoing sales and marketing activities in connection with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor in 2011 combined with an increase in head count during 2011 as compared to 2010 

general and administrative expenses were 1606 million 1924 million and 1299 million representing approximately 55 56 and 56 of revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease of 318 million or approximatively 165 from 2011 to 2012 is primarily attributable to reductions in outside services and reductions in the use of consultants along with the impact of reduced bonus decreased sharebased compensation expenses and lower royalty expenses the increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily attributed to increased expenses associated with our ongoing general and administrative activities in connection with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor in 2011 combined with an increase in head count during 2011 as compared to 2010 

other operating expenses 

amortization of acquisition—related intangible assets 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 444 million 427 million and 317 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase of 17 million or approximately 40 from 2011 to 2012 was primarily attributed to increased amortization resulting from completed iprd projects assumed as part of our recent acquisitions which were not amortized while inprocess and for which 2012 was the first full year of amortization upon the completion of the associated projects the increase of 110 million from 2010 to 2011 was primarily attributed to amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of the isbu from cypress semiconductor sanyo semiconductor and sdt 

restructuring 

restructuring asset impairments and other net was 1653 million 1027 million and 105 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the information below summarizes the major activities in each year for detailed information see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we initiated a voluntary retirement program for employees of sanyo semiconductor and certain of its subsidiaries we recorded net charges of approximately 359 million associated with this program consisting of employee severance charges of 476 million partially offset by 117 million attributed to pension plan curtailment gains 

additionally during the year ended december 31 2012 we executed a global headcount reduction program restructuring expenses resulting from this program consisted primarily of 112 million associated with employee severance charges 

we incurred additional charges related to the closure of certain of our facilities during 2012 see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on restructuring activity 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 57 million of employee separation charges and other charges associated with the closure of our ayutthaya thailand facility and partial closure of our bang pa in thailand facility in addition to 85 million of employee separation charges and other costs associated with the planned shutdown of operations at our facility in aizu japan 

  

as part of the sanyo semiconductor transaction we announced plans to integrate certain operations of sanyo semiconductor into our existing operations primarily for cost savings purposes during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 85 million in charges related to this integration additionally we recorded exit costs of approximately 15 million for items relating to the consolidation of factories 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded 35 million of employee separation costs and 01 million of exit costs associated with our acquisition of cmd and 22 million of employee separation charges associated with our acquisition of sdt 

see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on 2012 restructuring activities 

indefinite and longlived asset impairment charges 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we evaluated the current period operating results of the sanyo semiconductor products group and reassessed future projections for the segment as a result we determined that 944 million of carrying value for certain longlived assets associated with the sanyo semiconductor products group and 316 million of related intangible assets were impaired see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a complete discussion of factors influencing the sanyo semiconductor products group impairments and see note 3 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on the related intangible asset impairments 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we determined that approximately 141 million in carrying value of goodwill relating to our 2008 acquisition of catalyst was impaired resulting from a strategic decision to invest in other business units and the resulting decline in estimated future cash flows as part of our annual goodwill testing it was determined that certain intangible assets associated with the standard products group were impaired in connection with this impairment we wroteoff approximately 38 million of intangible assets these goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were recognized in our standard products group segment see note 3 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on other asset impairment activity 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 248 million of asset impairment charges associated with the closure of our ayutthaya thailand facility and partial closure of our bang pa in thailand facility due to flooding that occurred in that region additionally we recorded a 283 million inventory writeoff as a result of the flooding in the region the asset impairment charges and inventory writeoff were partially offset by the receipt of insurance recoveries for 489 million 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 615 million of asset impairment charges associated with the announced shutdown of our aizu japan wafer manufacturing facility and 48 million of other charges relating to damaged inventory and other assets resulting from the japanese earthquake and tsunami that occurred during 2011 

  

see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we determined that based on a decline in the business outlook 89 million of carrying value of goodwill relating to our 2009 acquisition of pulsecore and 72 million of carrying value related to intangible assets was impaired the 2010 impairment charges were recognized in the application products group segment see note 3 “goodwill and intangible assets” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded 39 million of asset impairment charges associated with the writeoff of a cost basis investment see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

operating income 

information about operating income from our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2012 december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 is as follows in millions 

 

 depreciation and amortization expense is included in segment operating income reconciliations of segment information to financial statements is as follows in millions 

 

 other unallocated operating expenses were 96 million 149 million and 415 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively these consecutive decreases are due to the expenses associated with changes in certain corporate decisions and initiatives which do not impact expenses that are directly attributable to our reporting segments 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased by 128 million from 689 million in 2011 to 561 million in 2012 additionally interest expense increased by 75 million from 614 million in 2010 to 689 million in 2011 we 

  

recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of 235 million 349 million and 337 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our average longterm debt balance including current maturities and net of debt discount during 2012 2011 and 2010 was 11095 million 10480 million and 9112 million respectively our weighted average interest rate on longterm debt including current maturities and net of debt discount was 51 66 and 67 per annum in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources—key financing and capital events” below for a description of our refinancing activities 

other 

other expense decreased by 147 million from a loss of 89 million in 2011 to a gain of 58 million in 2012 the change from 2011 to 2012 is primarily attributable to certain foreign exchange movements on the net underlying exposures that have no offsetting hedge positions other expense decreased by 20 million from a loss of 69 million in 2010 to a loss of 89 million in 2011 the change from 2010 to 2011 is primarily attributable to the strength of foreign currencies against the us dollar for the periods presented net of the impact from our hedging activities 

loss on debt repurchase or exchange 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we exchanged 999 million in par value 928 million of carrying value of our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 for 999 million in par value of 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 series b and 20 million in cash which resulted in a loss on debt exchange of 78 million this exchange extended the first put date of the underlying notes which we consider to be the earliest maturity date 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we exchanged 1986 million in par value 1772 million of carrying value of our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 for 1986 million in par value 1764 million of carrying value of 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 series b and 159 million in cash which resulted in a loss on debt exchange of 179 million this exchange extended the first put date of the underlying notes which we consider to be the earliest maturity date 

additionally during the year ended december 31 2011 we repurchased 530 million in par value 466 million of carrying value of our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 for 562 million in cash which resulted in a loss on debt repurchase of 53 million 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we prepaid 1698 million of our senior bank facilities and incurred a 08 million loss on the prepayment for the writeoff of 08 million in unamortized debt issuance costs additionally during 2010 we recognized a 01 million gain on the modification of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 

for a further discussion of losses incurred on debt repurchases or exchanges see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

gain on sanyo semiconductor transaction 

the purchase price of sanyo semiconductor was less than the fair value of its net assets resulting in a gain on acquisition of 243 million during 2011 we believe the gain recognized upon acquisition was the result of a number of factors including the following sanyo electric’s desire to discontinue semiconductor 

  

operations significant losses recognized by sanyo electric sanyo electric considering an acquisition as the best outcome for sanyo semiconductor and that significant costs were expected to be incurred in association with the transfer and consolidation of certain operations for further discussion of the gain on the sanyo semiconductor transaction see note 4 “acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 134 million 229 million and 128 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

the 2012 provision of 134 million included 217 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 09 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions this is partially offset by 78 million of additional tax benefit recorded and the reversal of 14 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2012 

the 2011 provision of 229 million included 194 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations 32 million of additional valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets and 29 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions this is partially offset by the reversal of 26 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2011 

the 2010 provision for income taxes of 128 million included 135 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 27 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions this is partially offset by the reversal of 34 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2010 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012 was negative 184 which differs from the us statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries our effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory federal income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2011 due to the impact of impairment losses and other operating losses recognized during the year in foreign jurisdictions for which tax benefits have not been recognized because uncertainty regarding their future realization exists our effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory federal income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2010 due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differentials in our foreign subsidiaries we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our domestic and japan related deferred tax assets 

income taxes have not been provided on approximately 12916 million of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2012 over which we have sufficient influence to control the distribution of such earnings and have determined that substantially all such earnings have been reinvested indefinitely these earnings could become subject to either or both federal income tax and foreign withholding tax if they are remitted as dividends if foreign earnings are loaned to any of our domestic companies or if we sell our investment in certain subsidiaries we estimate that repatriation of these foreign earnings would generate additional foreign withholding taxes of approximately 76 million us federal income taxes of approximately 540 million and state income taxes of approximately 42 million each after the assumed utilization of our available net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements offbalance sheet arrangements contingencies sources and uses of cash operations working capital and longterm assets and liabilities 

contractual obligations 

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt capital leases operating leases and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2012 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

 

  

  

  

 this table also excludes our pension obligations we expect to make cash contributions and future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements of approximately 274 million in 2013 this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors including the funded status of the plans beyond 2013 the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon among other things interest rates underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations 

see note 12 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for more information on our pension obligations 

our balance of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 6317 million at december 31 2012 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months total cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at december 31 2012 include approximately 3600 million available in the united states in addition to cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments already on hand in the united states we have the ability to access cash through existing credit facilities new bank loans debt obligations or by settling loans with our foreign subsidiaries in order to cover our domestic needs 

in connection with the sanyo semiconductor transaction sanyo electric agreed to provide certain operational support to sanyo semiconductor for a period of time relating to costs expenses and other amounts 

  

associated with seconded employees transition services and certain property leases this operational support ended on december 31 2012 while we have continued to take steps to reduce the cost structure of our sanyo semiconductor products group the expiration of this operational support is expected to directly impact the margin levels of the sanyo semiconductor products group 

see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a discussion of longterm debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

in the normal course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us as required for transactions such as material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases or customs guarantees our senior revolving credit facility includes a 400 million availability for the issuance of letters of credit a 02 million letter of credit was outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility as of december 31 2012 we also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our senior revolving credit facility of 59 million at december 31 2012 

as part of securing financing in the normal course of business we issued guarantees related to our receivable financing capital lease obligations and real estate mortgages which totaled approximately 841 million as of december 31 2012 we are also a guarantor of sci llc’s unsecured loan with sanyo electric which had a balance of 3020 million as of december 31 2012 see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements 

for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and similarly incur expenses totaling 1206 million as payments come due we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases letters of credit and guarantee arrangements see note 15 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

contingencies 

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to ip infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable indemnity rights to such customer for valid warranty claims 

we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

  

in addition to the above from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisers and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 15 “commitment and contingencies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for possible contingencies related to legal matters see also part i item 1 “business—government regulation” for information on certain environmental matters 

sources and uses of cash 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures for strategic acquisitions and investments to repurchase our stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand and shortterm investments additionally as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

 

  

 our ability to service our longterm debt including our senior subordinated notes to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings 

  

will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next twelve months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

during the ordinary course of business we evaluate our cash requirements and if necessary adjust our expenditures for inventory operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand during 2012 we paid 2563 million for capital expenditures while in 2011 we paid 3164 million our current projection for capital expenditures in 2013 is approximately 160 million to 170 million of which our current minimum commitment is approximately 44 million the capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives 

on december 23 2011 we entered into a 3250 million fiveyear senior revolving credit facility which significantly increases our liquidity and is described under “key financing and capital events—2011 financing events—senior revolving credit facility” 

primary cash flow sources 

our longterm cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash our cash flows from operations is summarized as follows in millions 

 

 our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on among other factors our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets 

our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below 

  

working capital 

working capital calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs in addition our working capital may be effected by capital activities as part of our share repurchase program and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments our working capital including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 6691 million at december 31 2012 and has fluctuated between 10762 million and 6691 million over the last eight quarterends although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives for the year ended december 31 2012 our working capital decreased primarily due to payments associated with restructuring activities as discussed in note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for the year ended december 31 2012 our working capital was also impacted by approximately 555 million in share repurchase activity inclusive of fees commissions and other expenses see note 10 “earnings per share and equity” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our share repurchase program 

longterm assets and liabilities 

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets and goodwill 

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves in general the annual funding of our foreign defined benefit pension plan obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions see note 12 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion of our tax reserves see note 9 “income taxes” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

key financing and capital events

2011 financing events 

senior revolving credit facility 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we entered into a 3250 million fiveyear senior revolving credit facility the “facility” the terms of which are set forth in a credit agreement dated as of december 23 2011 “credit agreement” between us and a group of lenders the facility provides for 400 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit 150 million availability for swingline loans for shortterm borrowings and a foreign currency sublimit of 750 million we have the ability to increase the size of the facility from timetotime in increments of 100 million so long as after giving effect to such increases the aggregate amount of all such increases does not exceed 1250 million while there is no balance due on the facility as of december 31 2012 a letter of credit is outstanding under the facility in the amount of 02 million additionally we have other letters of credit outstanding see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on the senior revolving credit facility and other debt instruments

acquisition note payable to sanyo electric 

during the year ended december 31 2011 sci llc as borrower and we as guarantor entered into a sevenyear unsecured loan agreement with sanyo electric to finance a portion of the purchase price of the sanyo semiconductor transaction the loan had an original principal amount of approximately 3775 million and had a principal balance of 3020 million as of december 31 2012 the loan bears interest at a rate of 3month libor plus 175 per annum and provides for quarterly interest and 94 million in principal payments with the unpaid balance of 1227 million due in january 2018 see note 8 “longterm debt” and note 20 “subsequent events” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for further details relating to the acquisition note payable to sanyo electric 

2010 financing events 

amended indenture for zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we unilaterally amended the indenture for our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 which provided an additional opportunity to require us to repurchase the notes on april 15 2012 and deferred our ability to redeem the notes at our option from april 15 2010 to april 15 2012 the terms of this put option were otherwise identical to preexisting terms of the notes 

in accordance with the right of the holders of the notes to require us to purchase the notes on april 15 2010 we purchased approximately 32 million of the 994 million par value of the outstanding notes this amendment was considered a substantial modification for accounting purposes resulting in 962 million of original remaining debt to be deemed extinguished a 01 million gain and new convertible debt with a fair value of 985 million was deemed to be issued 

prepayment of senior bank facilities 

during the year ended december 31 2010 we terminated our then existing senior bank facilities by making a full prepayment of the 1698 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the term loan portion this amount would have been due in september 2013 subject to scheduled principal amortization and other required prepayments under the senior bank facilities we incurred no penalties in connection with this early termination 

the termination of our then existing senior bank facilities in 2010 temporarily impacted our liquidity while providing additional financial and operational flexibility since the termination we have continued to generate strong free cash flow we regained this liquidity with the entry into our new senior revolving credit facility in december 2011 as described above 

debt guarantees and related covenants 

our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 and our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 series b are subordinated to the senior indebtedness of on semiconductor corporation and its guarantor subsidiaries as defined in note 19 “guarantor and nonguarantor statements” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k on the terms described in the indentures for such notes as of december 31 2012 we believe that we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 and our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 series b and with covenants relating to our 

  

senior revolving credit facility and various other debt agreements we believe that we will be able to comply with the various covenants and other requirements contained in such indentures and debt agreements through at least december 31 2013 

s ee note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information on our debt instruments 

cash management 

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue although to a much lesser extent from manufacturing services provided to customers distributor revenue is recognized in various ways within the industry some recognize revenue upon sale to the distributor while others like us recognize revenue when the sale is made to the end customer additionally there can often be a lag in the data collection from distributors which may have an effect on our revenue recognition due to our high distributor sales revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy we recognize revenue on sales to oems and electronic manufacturing service providers net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet given our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that it has resold the products to the enduser inaccuracies in the sales or inventory data provided to us by our distributors can therefore result in inaccuracy in our reporting revenues although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including value added and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience our oem customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under our general agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns 

  

and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized and are netted against revenues given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products our actual returns and allowances and warranty claims have not traditionally fluctuated significantly from period to period and our returns and allowances and warranty provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period of two years at the time revenue is recognized we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales recorded as a component of cost of revenues in addition we also offer cash discounts to customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time generally 10 days after shipment we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues based on experience with each customer 

freight and handling costs are included in the cost of revenues and are recognized as period expenses during the period in which they are incurred 

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected enduser demand these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

deferred tax valuation allowance  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will more likely than not be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense we maintain a valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets and most of our foreign deferred tax assets 

i mpairment of longlived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our asset groups that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value when material these gains are recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

  

goodwill  we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows discount and longterm growth rates we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments the assumptions about future conditions include factors such as future revenues gross profits operating expenses and industry trends changes in these estimates based on evolving economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable actual future results may differ from those estimates we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analysis 

when evaluating goodwill for impairment we initially perform a qualitative assessment which includes a review and analysis of certain quantitative factors to estimate if our reporting units’ fair values significantly exceed their carrying values when the estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value appears likely to be less than its carrying value based on this assessment we continue to the first step of a two step impairment test 

the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if during this second step we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

we have determined that our product families which are components of our operating segments constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill our product families are one level below the operating segments constituting individual businesses with our segment management conducting regular reviews of the operating results for each product family as of each acquisition date all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date 

our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of 2013 however identification of a triggering event may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods 

defined benefit plans and related benefits  we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our nonus employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs and estimated withdrawal liabilities are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees all of these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment and consultation with an actuary considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans as of december 31 2012 a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately 560 million 

contingencies  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

at december 31 2012 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 10119 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 6081 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 4038 million balance on our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2012 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately 20 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase 

to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures from an accounting and economic perspective however given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the united states dollar as a normal part of the reporting process our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor we have increased our revenue expense and capital purchases in japanese yen thus increasing the effects of this translation 

we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a nonfunctional currency changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged the notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 1973 million and 2034 million respectively our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies including japanese yen euros malaysian ringgit philippines peso singapore dollars canadian dollars swiss francs chinese renminbi czech koruna and british pounds sterling due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the us dollar for example we determined that based on a hypothetical weighted average change of 10 in currency exchange rates our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately 415 million as of december 31 2012 assuming no offsetting hedge positions 

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the exchange act based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

on january 1 2011 we acquired sanyo semiconductor and certain related assets which operated under its own set of systems and internal controls we are monitoring and maintaining sanyo semiconductor’s control environment in conjunction with our control environment until the sanyo semiconductor integration is complete in 2013 the sanyo semiconductor controls will continue to change over time until the integration is completed 

there have been no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f that occurred during the year ended december 31 2012 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

end markets for our products 

  

the following table sets forth our principal enduser markets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each enduser market during 2011 sample applications for our products and representative oem customers and end users 

 

   

   

original equipment manufacturers direct sales to oems accounted for approximately 56 of our revenues in 2011 46 of our revenues in 2010 and 47 of our revenues in 2009 the increase from 2010 to 2011 was driven by the significantly higher mix of oem revenue from the sanyo semiconductor acquisition these customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as continental automotive systems delta samsung hella delphi lg electronics motorola mobility motorola solutions schneider ge honeywell broadcom siemens nokia cisco systems and sony ericsson we focus on three types of oems multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core oem customers the target market customers in the communications power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are oems that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our oem customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

  

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 37 of our revenues in 2011 45 of our revenues in 2010 and 42 of our revenues in 2009 the decrease from 2010 to 2011 was driven by significantly lower mix of distributors from the sanyo semiconductor acquisition our distributors which include arrow avnet ebv elektronik future world peace and yosun resell to midsized and smaller oems and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with certain of our distributors contain stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns due to our inability to reasonably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to these distributors until these distributors resell the product as a result sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 

  

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 7 of our revenues in 2011 9 of our revenues in 2010 and 11 of our revenues in 2009 our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are flextronics jabil benchmark electronic and celestica these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for oems originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many oems now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace 

  

see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 17 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for revenues by geographic locations 

  

manufacturing operations 

  

we operate frontend wafer site facilities located in belgium canada the czech republic japan malaysia and the united states and backend assembly and test site facilities located in canada china japan malaysia philippines thailand and vietnam in addition to these frontend and backend manufacturing operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities we operate all of our manufacturing facilities directly except in the case of our joint venture in leshan china 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we committed to the aizu plan to close our wafer manufacturing facility located in aizu japan by the end of the second quarter of 2012 under the aizu plan a majority of the aizu japan production will be transferred to other wafer fabrication facilities the aizu plan is being undertaken as part of our overall drive for operational efficiencies and is in line with an ongoing strategy aimed at migrating inhouse production to large high volume facilities and investing in more advanced wafer technologies 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we committed to a plan to close our probe assembly and test operations located in ayutthaya thailand and to partially close our facility in bang pa in thailand “thailand plans” as a result of the damage caused to those facilities by the 2011 flooding in that region and the fact that the costs to recover and reconstruct those facilities would be excessive under the thailand plans a majority of the ayutthaya and bang pa in production will be transferred to other companyowned facilities that have excess equipment capacity and excess floor space and to some external subcontractors we anticipate that the thailand plans will be completed by the end of june 2012 

  

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities the sizes of the locations represent the approximate gross square footage of each site’s building and include among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

 

   

  

      

we operate an assembly and test operations facility in leshan china this facility is owned by a joint venture company leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited “leshan” of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is formerly a stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 70 of leshan’s production capacity in 2011 70 in 2010 and 73 in 2009 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 70 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2012 in 2011 and 2010 we incurred no underutilization charges in 2009 we incurred 27 million in underutilization charges as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan we supply die used in the production process 

  

the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations in june 2002 we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to 2310 million in semiconductor operations which is in addition to the 2780 million originally approved in 2004 we committed to make capital contributions of approximately 250 million to this joint venture by 2012 subject to market conditions as of december 31 2011 we had made capital contributions of approximately 164 million to this joint venture we have the ability to time these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including amkor utac unisem nantong stars umc and tsmc accounted for approximately 18 29 and 25 of our manufacturing costs in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

raw materials 

  

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers gold copper and lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a justintime basis and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table showing commitments contingencies and indemnities in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this report from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

sales marketing and distribution 

  

as of december 31 2011 our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 1258 professionals operating out of approximately 47 offices which serve customers in 77 countries we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective internetbased applications support from our laboratories in the czech republic china and the united states through online connectivity applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions we continue to monitor our freight and logistical support operations for potential cost savings

we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor ® and our on logo as well as under the licensed trademark and logo of sanyo semiconductor which we are able to utilize for a three year period from the acquisition date with some extension of time for certain products that are manufactured but not yet sold by the end of 2013 we own rights to a number of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property directly related to and important to our business in connection with our 1999 recapitalization motorola assigned licensed or sublicensed to us as the case may be certain intellectual property to support and continue the operation of our business we also acquired or were licensed or sublicensed a significant amount of intellectual property including patents and patent applications in connection with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor in connection with the intellectual property received from both the motorola and sanyo semiconductor transactions we received a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from general unknown and certain known infringement claims from third parties as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 6129 us and foreign patents and approximately 3511 patent applications pending worldwide our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2031 none of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business additionally we have rights to more than 370 registered and common law trademarks our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 

  

seasonality 

  

our revenues are affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related endmarkets traditionally the seasonal trend consisted of a soft first half of the year with a stronger second half of the year for consumer products in recent years the industry has also been affected by significant shifts in consumer demand due to economic downturns or other factors which may result in volatility in order patterns and lead times sudden shifts in product demand and periodic production overcapacity we have in the past experienced substantial quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenues and operating results and in the future could to continue to experience short term periodtoperiod fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions 

  

backlog 

  

our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are predominately booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demands from our electronic data interface customers in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times for those shipments to distributors who are allowed sales return rights and allowances we record revenues on a “sellthrough” basis thus backlog comprised of orders from these distributors will not result in revenues until these distributors sell the products ordered during 2011 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 82 and 91 of actual revenues during such quarter which is lower on a percentage basis than prior years due to the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor as that business has a lower backlog as compared to the 

  

historical on semiconductor business as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases customers tend to order products further in advance and as a result backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 

  

in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 

  

we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for generalpurpose semiconductor products like ours is highly competitive although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits asics and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products see part i item 1a “risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” located elsewhere in this report 

  

when compared to us several of the competitors noted below are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions below we discuss the effects of competition on our four primary operating segments 

  

computing and consumer products group 

  

the principal methods of competition in the computing and consumer products group are technical performance total solution cost of ownership quality and assurance of supply our architectures for acdc conversion offer a competitive total cost of ownership and leadership in power efficiency to compete our architecture for our microprocessor and ddr memory controllers offers a competitive cost of ownership and performance position to compete in the computing and consumer game console market in addition the breadth of our portfolio in other support functions such as dc dc converters over voltage protection ic’s video and audio ics and standard analog and logic ic’s give us the opportunity to serve multiple requirements and allow customers to control their vendor lists more easily our significant competitors in this market include intersil corporation maxim integrated products inc texas instruments incorporated stmicroelectronics nv and power integrations inc 

  

automotive industrial medical and milaero 

  

the principal methods of competition in the automotive industrial medical and milaero product group are with other customerspecific semiconductor vendors based on design experience manufacturing capability depth and quality of intellectual property ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product length of design cycle longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel 

  

our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables both inside and outside of our control these variables include but are not limited to the timeliness with which we can develop new 

  

products and technologies product performance and quality manufacturing yields and availability customer service pricing industry trends and general economic trends 

  

our medical and custom industrial businesses face direct competition from large diversified semiconductor suppliers that supply custom and semicustom ics such as stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated the business also faces direct competition from smaller endmarketfocused mixedsignal suppliers such as elmos semiconductor and zmd ag direct competition also comes from our target customers themselves who may have internal ic design resources dedicated to supporting the parent our timing products business faces direct competition from clock suppliers such as cypress semiconductor and integrated device technology inc and our digital asic business faces threats from fpga vendors such as xilinx inc and altera corporation as well as digital asic suppliers like opensilicon inc and esilicon corporation our primary foundry competition includes xfab semiconductor foundries ag taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd tower semiconductor ltd and magnachip semiconductor llc 

  

we also face indirect competition from assp suppliers such as microchip technology inc whose mixedsignal microcontroller products capture lowend mixedsignal asic opportunities indirect competition also comes from analog standard products suppliers such as maxim integrated products inc analog devices inc and linear technology corporation whose technical performance or offtheshelf availability may be better than what we can offer 

  

the principal methods of competition in the configurable analog products led drivers and eeprom spaces are product performance and new product innovations where we are specifically focusing on integrating ip eg eeprom digital potentiometer and voltage reference blocks as building blocks to create high valueadded assps our significant competitors include atmel corporation stmicroelectronics nv microchip technology incorporated fairchild semiconductor international inc intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation and texas instruments incorporated 

  

standard products group 

  

our competitive strengths are in our market leading protection and filtering products the breadth of our portfolio technical performance micropackaging expertise our high quality low cost structure and supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers in addition our strengths include our strong intellectual property “ip” portfolio and our ability to leverage ip blocks across the company to develop high valueadded assps 

  

the principal methods of competing in our discrete semiconductor products are through new product and package innovations with enhanced performance over existing products of particular importance are our over voltage protection and filtering portfolios esd protection tvs zeners power switching and rectification products and constant current regulators “ccrs” where we enjoy significant performance advantages over our competition our significant competitors include diodes incorporated nxp bv rohm co ltd tsps corporation infineon technologies ag vishay intertechnology inc fairchild semiconductor international inc stmicroelectronics nv and semtech corporation one specific competitive challenge this group faces is our small market share with certain japanese automotive customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor in january 2011 we expect this weakness to be mitigated 

  

sanyo semiconductor products group 

  

the principal methods of competition for sanyo semiconductor are technical performance quality service and price our competitive strengths in this group are our strong technology and design capability breadth of product portfolio systems design expertise and longstanding supply relationships with leading oem customers our significant competitors include toshiba corporation renasas electronics corporation nxp 

  

bv rohm co ltd mistubishi electric stmicroelectronics nv fairchild semiconductor international inc international rectifier corporation and texas instruments incorporated 

  

research and development 

  

companysponsored research and development costs in 2011 2010 and 2009 were 3625 million 105 of revenue 2480 million 107 of revenue and 1988 million 112 of revenue respectively our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications during 2011 research and development costs increased due to increased expense associated with ongoing research and development activities associated with our sanyo semiconductor acquisition along with an increase in labor cost related to increases in head count 

  

government regulation 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 

  

our headquarters in phoenix arizona is located on property that is a “superfund” site a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to cleanup activities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act motorola and now freescale semiconductor inc “freescale” have been actively involved in the cleanup of onsite solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and offsite contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola retained responsibility for this contamination and motorola and freescale have agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter 

  

our manufacturing location in aizu japan is located on property where soil and ground water contamination has been detected we believe that the contamination originally occurred during a time when the facility was operated by a prior owner we are working with local authorities to determine the appropriate remediation actions and expect remediation costs subject to certain limitations to be indemnified pursuant to an agreement between us and the prior owner or covered by insurance subject to a deductible based on information available any net costs to us in connection with this matter are not expected to be material 

  

our manufacturing facility in the czech republic has ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that this facility was operated by governmentowned entities the remediation project consists primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located onsite and offsite with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded the government of the czech republic has agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries subject to specified limitations for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination based upon the information available we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 

  

our design center in east greenwich rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination when we purchased the east greenwich facility we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property based on the information available we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

  

as a result of the acquisition of amis we are a “primary responsible party” to an environmental remediation and cleanup at amis’s former corporate headquarters in santa clara california costs incurred by amis include implementation of the cleanup plan operations and maintenance of remediation systems and 

  

other project management costs however amis’s former parent company a subsidiary of nippon mining contractually agreed to indemnify amis and us for any obligation relating to environmental remediation and cleanup at this location we have not offset the receivable from nippon mining’s subsidiary against the estimated liability on the consolidated balance sheets therefore a receivable from nippon mining’s subsidiary is recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2011 related to this matter in the amount of 01 million we do not believe that the liability and receivable amounts are material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow 

  

we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and liability for currently known environmental conditions to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects it is possible however that future developments including changes in laws and regulations government policies customer specification personnel and physical property conditions including currently undiscovered contamination could lead to material costs 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 19442 employees worldwide of which 2411 employees are in the united states none of our employees in the united states are covered by collective bargaining agreements certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements ie japan and belgium or similar arrangements or are represented by workers councils for information regarding employee risk associated with our international operations see part i item 1a “risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” elsewhere in this report of the total number of our employees as of december 31 2011 approximately 15286 were engaged in manufacturing approximately 1258 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization which includes customer service approximately 708 were engaged in administration and approximately 2190 were engaged in research and development

you should carefully consider the trends risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this form 10k and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the sec before making any investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following trends risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected the trading prices of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment all forwardlooking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 

  

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

  

from time to time we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and incur additional operating losses in the future 

  

at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses reduced enduser demand price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity the effects of natural disasters such as the flooding in thailand or the japan earthquake and tsunami and other factors could adversely affect our business in order to remain profitable we must continue to successfully implement our business plan and examine and implement potentially advantageous cost reduction initiatives 

  

we have significant operations in thailand and the recent flooding in thailand has negatively impacted our operations in thailand 

  

our sanyo semiconductor division’s thailand operations including buildings and equipment and books and financial and other corporate records located at the rojana industrial park in ayutthaya thailand have been severely damaged by or lost as a result of the recent flooding in thailand we also have operations located in an industrial park in bang pa in thailand that were affected by the flood we are continuing to monitor customer production needs and are shifting production to other facilities within and outside of our global manufacturing network we believe that it will take multiple quarters for restoration of our production capacity to preflood levels andor to transfer production to other sites the flooding will negatively impact revenues and earnings such impacts could include but are not limited to i impacts on our ability to continue to acquire the components of our products on a timely basis from vendors that have been affected by the floods or from alternative sources of supply if any ii impacts on the continuing availability of uninterrupted services from subcontractors iii impacts on the cost of component materials and services that we acquire from our vendors and subcontractors which may increase as a result of supply shortages or otherwise iv impacts from customer purchase order or inventory cancellations or reductions and lost market share and v impacts from restructuring or facility closure activities including employee severance payments 

  

in addition we have not been able to determine the extent to which our historical books and financial and other corporate records and data for our sanyo semiconductor division’s thailand operations have been lost due to the flooding including any records that may have been saved electronically and the backup storage for these electronic records we are continuing to evaluate the extent to which this data may have been lost our ability to recover or reconstruct any such data that has been lost and other impacts of the loss of any such data and our options for dealing with the resultant circumstances if any such data has been lost and we are unable to recover or reconstruct the data it could adversely impact our historical reporting of our financial results 

  

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns and upturns 

  

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and as a result is subject to significant downturns and upturns the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices on the other hand significant upturns have led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in some ways we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience these in the future we cannot accurately predict the timing of the current and future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these conditions might be these future conditions in the semiconductor industry could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

economic conditions including those related to the credit markets may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

  

uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in fluctuations to and reductions in consumer and commercial spending from time to time the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions reduced spending has in the past and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which results in a negative impact on gross profit volatility in global economic conditions may adversely and materially affect our industry business and results of operations and we cannot accurately predict volatility or how severe and prolonged any downturn or recovery might be in addition to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected then our business and results of operations could be adversely and materially affected moreover volatility in revenues as a result of unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our short term and long term strategies 

  

furthermore the united states and global credit markets could experience renewed financial turmoil if the past pressures on credit were renewed or we experience an additional global downturn we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all and we may not be able to refinance if necessary any outstanding debt when due all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures for the immediate future if our operating results falter and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition unanticipated global financial uncertainty affecting the financial and other markets could impact our business in a number of other ways including causing 1 our customers and consumers in general to defer purchases 2 our customers difficulties in obtaining sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us 3 our key suppliers to become capacity constrained or insolvent resulting in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and 4 our key suppliers to require acceleration of payments to them or our customers to delay payments to us any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses incurring additional debt assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 

  

in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful 

  

acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts we face risks resulting from the expansion of our operations through acquisitions including but not limited to 1 the difficulty of integrating aligning and coordinating organizations which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures 2 risks of entering new semiconductor markets or regions of the world in which we have limited experience 3 risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies such as sanyo semiconductor particularly if such company is lacking adequate financial reporting and internal control systems or possesses systems that are materially different from ours 4 the risk that our due diligence in the acquisition process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities that are in existence at the time of our acquisition 5 the risk that our existing or prospective customers or customers of the acquired business may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions as we integrate new businesses and companies into our business or that they may seek to change their existing business relationships 6 challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions including difficulties in entering into new market segments in which we are not experienced 7 the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets 8 difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses and 9 negative pressure on gross margins resulting from increased operating and restructuring costs associated with the target 

  

in addition current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us and as a result we could lose key employees these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel in connection with a transaction key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in the form of changeincontrol agreements acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equitybased compensation rights further as a result of our acquisitions we may assume liabilities from the target’s current employee benefit plans that may require us to bring plan documentation into compliance with current law including ensuring that plans are adequately funded 

  

in connection with our acquisition activity we are required by generally accepted accounting principles and sec rules and regulations to integrate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or if they do have independent audited financial statements such statements may not be prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems which could materially impair our ability to obtain or prepare necessary financial information concerning such businesses in a format required to allow proper integration with our systems and financials in addition immediately after an acquisition and until such time as we are able to fully integrate an acquired business into our financial statements we may be dependent on the acquired business’ financial controls and systems for reporting and other financial information including projections and goals for such acquired business we may not be able to successfully prepare and file required financial statements or other financial information for the acquired business or to integrate the acquired business into our financial controls and systems and our consolidated financial statements in a timely manner failure to prepare accurate financial reports for our acquired businesses in a timely manner in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could cause material inaccuracies in our financial statements and sec filings which could result in the necessity to restate our financials or lead to unknown liabilities and possibly result in a material impact on our stock price 

  

the integration of newly acquired businesses will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management in particular the integration of sanyo semiconductor has and will continue to require significant internal and external coordination the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships moreover even if we were able to fully integrate new acquisition’s business operations and other assets successfully there can be no assurance that such integration will result in the 

  

realization of the full benefits of synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from the acquisition or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time delays in integrating our acquisitions which could be caused by factors outside of our control could adversely affect the intended benefits of our business financial results financial condition and stock price 

  

in connection with an acquisition it is possible that we may anticipate tax savings through integration of the newly acquired business into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure as with any estimate it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be incorrect 

  

we review goodwill associated with our acquisitions for impairment on an annual basis see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 2 “significant accounting policies — goodwill” of the notes to our consolidated audited financial statements located elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information about goodwill in the past we recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions factors we consider important that could trigger a subsequent impairment to goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues andor increased costs we may have further material goodwill impairments 

  

in addition we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results for example in the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor and related assets in early 2011 “sanyo transaction” a portion of the purchase price was financed by a sevenyear loan with an adjustable interest rate from sanyo electric to sci llc the loan agreement contains customary events of default as well as representations warranties and covenants but does not contain any financial or negative covenants it is possible that factors outside of our control including but not limited to increases in interest rates and loss of key customers could adversely affect the intended benefits from the sanyo transaction but we will continue to have a repayment obligation under the loan agreement 

  

our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization and realizing expected synergies from acquisitions 

  

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing for instance if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits in addition increased competition and other factors beyond our control including economic factors may lead to price erosion lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

  

moreover we believe that we will need to improve the historic margin levels of the business and assets we acquired in connection with the sanyo transaction and successfully execute on available opportunities in order to realize the intended benefits of this transaction while we anticipate that this acquired business will benefit from expected synergies with our business and planned restructuring which could improve its historic margin levels we may not be able to successfully integrate this business within our estimated timeframes or at all to allow it to benefit from expected synergies and planned restructuring or we may have generally overestimated the anticipated benefits of expected synergies and planned restructurings furthermore sanyo electric has agreed to provide certain operational support to sanyo semiconductor for a period of time which is meant to reduce sanyo semiconductor’s existing operational costs to marketbased costs this operational support relates to among other things costs expenses and other amounts associated with seconded employees the services agreement and various lease agreements there is no guarantee that we will be able to take advantage of all of 

  

the operational support available or that following the expiration of such operational support margin levels of sanyo semiconductor will have improved to the point that we are able to operate sanyo semiconductor profitably 

  

in addition the sanyo transaction will continue to allow for crossselling opportunities between the company and the acquired company and its customers but we cannot guarantee that these crossselling opportunities will be as great as anticipated or result in synergies as expected ultimately failure to realize anticipated synergies complete planned restructurings or execute on expected opportunities from the sanyo transaction may lead to lower revenues and lower margins than anticipated in the future 

  

the failure to implement as well as the completion and impact of our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions including restructuring activities could adversely affect our business 

  

from time to time we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to among other things significant downturns in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments as well as gains on the sale of assets and insurance recoveries 

  

we also often undertake restructuring activities in connection with our business acquisitions and integrations which can result in significant charges including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges for a description of certain restructuring activities in connection with our sanyo semiconductor and other recent acquisitions see note 4 “acquisitions” within the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

we cannot assure you that our current restructuring plans or future cost reduction initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented or will materially impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition 

  

for additional information regarding our profitability enhancement programs and cost reduction measures see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

  

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 continue to aggressively manage maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 further expand our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 rationalize our manufacturing operations 7 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 8 reduce selling and administrative expenses 9 manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands 10 actively manage working capital 11 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 12 integrate newly acquired products manufacturing capabilities and sales channels we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy 

  

will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

  

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other things to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these factors and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

  

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

  

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 

  

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

  

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies the development of new products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects moreover we may make significant investment in new products that may not be profitable or that do not have margins as high as we anticipated or experienced historically 

  

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

  

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days for customer products without incurring a 

  

significant penalty we routinely purchase inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

  

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for semiconductor components is highly competitive as a result of current economic uncertainty competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

  

the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness many of our competitors particularly larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

  

because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as from customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 

  

we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends 

  

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

  

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

  

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to 

  

suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other things capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities including as a part of our cost reduction measures and in reaction to manmade and natural disasters such as the flooding in thailand and earthquake and resulting tsunami in japan upgrading or expanding existing facilities changing our process technologies or uncertainty as a result of the acquisition and integration of manufacturing facilities acquired as a result of our acquisition activities any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

  

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing information technology and equipment to remain competitive the failure inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and such capital expenditures and commitments as well as other commitments may materially decrease our liquidity 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices we maintain certain of our own manufacturing assembly and test facilities which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 

  

we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency any such implementation however can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or in some instances to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned in the case of abandonment we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

  

in the recent past we have undertaken various and material cost reduction measures which we believe have been largely successful however these reductions and any future reductions may unintentionally affect our ability to remain competitive in efficiency and productivity ultimately we may be forced to increase our future capital expenditures in unexpected ways to meet our operational needs in among other areas manufacturing information technology and equipment we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make timely and necessary investments in the areas discussed above or other areas we have not identified 

  

in addition we have had and expect to have significant cash and capital expenditures related to the sanyo transaction and thailand flooding in 2011 although we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs and expenses related to this transaction and subsequent 2011 thailand flooding we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with cash on hand shortterm investments and funds from external borrowings will be adequate to operate our business and otherwise satisfy our capital needs given these capital expenditures and other costs associated with sanyo semiconductor if we are unable to generate expected cash flows our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives related to the sanyo semiconductor operations there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 

  

we are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and other extraordinary events 

  

our worldwide operations are subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions from time to time which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial reporting and condition we are 

  

susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods hurricanes typhoons droughts and other extreme weather conditions earthquakes tsunamis volcanoes and similar natural disasters as well as power outages power shortages telecommunications failures and similar events such events can cause direct injury or damage to our employees and property including our books and financial and corporate records and data and related internal controls and can also have significant direct and indirect consequences for example such events can negatively impact revenues and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event such costs may include expenses to restore production or to move production to other facilities including incremental capital expenditures and costs for expedited shipping expenses incurred with a shutdown of the damaged facility including employee severance payments and other unusual costs and expenses such as fixed asset impairments inventory writedowns charges relating to cancellation of purchase orders for excess materials and charges for restoration and recovery work overall costs may also be impacted by other factors such as the under absorption of our manufacturing and operating support overhead such events may also affect the infrastructure of the country in which the event occurs causing water damage power outages transportation delays and restrictions public health issues and economic instability and disrupting local and international supply chains as a result we could experience shortages of and interruptions in supply and increased prices for components that we source from companies located in or with operations in any such country as well as from other suppliers whose supply chains may similarly be affected such shortages and interruptions may also affect our ability to timely deliver our products to customers and as a result our customers may seek substitute products from other manufacturers consequences such as power outages including any rolling blackouts or other anticipated problems could adversely affect our business by among other things harming our internal operations limiting our ability to communicate with our customers and suppliers and limiting our customers’ ability to sell or use our products in addition damage or destruction to our property including our books and financial and corporate records and data could adversely affect our ability to prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the historical and future reporting of our financial results and our ability to integrate the financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies responding to natural disasters and their consequences will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above such insurance may be subject to deductible and coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms 

  

if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

  

product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects in addition the integration of the business acquired in connection with the sanyo transaction requires significant coordination and we cannot assure you that our existing customer relationships or sanyo semiconductor’s prior customer relationships will not be materially and adversely affected as a result of uncertainty in connection with or other factors relating to the newly combined entity 

  

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

  

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including polysilicon silicon wafers 

  

gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

in addition for some of our products we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt production in material ways in addition we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 

  

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

  

a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the asiapacific region the americas and europe including the middle east similarly we maintain significant operations in these regions in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in the last few fiscal years we have benefited from relatively low effective tax rates because most of our income has been earned and reinvested in jurisdictions outside the us our effective tax rate is uncertain on an ongoing basis changes to income tax regulations in the united states could under our existing tax structure significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operations and otherwise 

  

have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition business combinations and investment transactions could impact our effective tax rate 

  

we hold a significant amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements debt repurchases and payments and acquisitions if we are unable to address our us cash requirements through operations through borrowings under our current debt agreements or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

other activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange for instance while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

  

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

  

our success both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and financial personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive for example analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components in addition from time to time we have announced certain cost reductions that included the freezing of salaries and elimination of bonuses mandatory unpaid time off factory shutdowns and reduction in personnel these measures as well as any future cost reduction measures could negatively affect morale and lead to unintended employee attrition at all levels of our organization moreover we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel 

  

as employee incentives we have issued common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time rsu’s with timebased vesting and performance based awards any difficulty relating to obtaining stockholder approval of new or amendments to equity compensation plans could limit our ability to issue these types of awards our stock price at times has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of certain of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on various registered and unregistered intellectual property assets patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

  

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty intellectual property rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such intellectual property rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for intellectual property we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

  

we also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 

  

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

  

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in 

  

addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged intellectual property rights 

  

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

  

all industries including the semiconductor industry are subject to legal claims with and without merit including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general we are involved in a variety of legal matters most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers employment and labor and intellectual property we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however defense and settlement costs can be substantial even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

as mentioned above from time to time we have been or may in the future be involved in securities litigation or litigation arising from our acquisitions we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation matter in which we are a party these types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future in addition we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions will not subject us to additional litigation see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for more information on our legal proceedings 

  

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

  

like most publiclytraded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm as we continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of sox we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future 

  

the integration of sanyo semiconductor into our internal control over financial reporting will require additional time and resources from our management and other personnel and will increase our compliance costs we are continuing to evaluate the impact that the integration of sanyo semiconductor will have in the future on our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future failure to comply with sox including delaying 

  

or failing to successfully integrate sanyo semiconductor into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of this transaction and the trading price of our common stock may decline in addition if we fail to remedy any material weakness our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements our financial statements may be materially inaccurate our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

  

see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 

  

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other things regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola in some cases through successor entities including but not limited to freescale motorola mobility and motorola solutions has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities 

  

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

  

   

   

   

   

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design oems are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim 

  

against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

new legal requirements particularly with respect to health care reform could increase the cost of our employee benefits and adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations 

  

we incur significant costs to maintain competitive employee benefits to attract and retain our highly skilled personnel changes to the regulatory environment with respect to these benefits could adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations in particular the health care reform legislation enacted by the us congress is intended to result in significant changes to the us health care system this legislation may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of the new healthcare regulations and may impair our ability to provide the same level of coverage 

  

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could damage our reputation and harm our business and operating results 

  

we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses illegal hacking acts of vandalism or terrorism our security measures andor those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information cause an interruption in our operations result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data result in a violation of privacy or other laws expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation which could harm our business and operating results 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

  

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

  

despite the fact that we have recently retired some of our historic debt obligations with existing cash flow we are still highly leveraged and have recently assumed more debt in connection with the sanyo transaction and therefore have substantial debt service obligations in addition we may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments from time to time the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

  

we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness from time to time may limit us and our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next 12 months if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities moreover the debt we may incur from time to time may require collateral to secure such indebtedness which would place our assets at risk as well as limit our flexibility related to such assets ultimately we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all and we may need to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 

  

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

  

our debt agreements from time to time may contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

  

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we 

  

were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

  

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements from time to time may contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to then current stockholders 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

  

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter in addition to the other factors described above factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had significant variance and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

  

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

industry overview 

  

according to wsts an industry research firm worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 2995 billion in 2011 an increase of 04 from 2983 billion in 2010 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market since 2007 

 

  

    

worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew 32 in 2007 declined 27 in 2008 declined 90 in 2009 grew 318 in 2010 and grew 04 in 2011 following a pattern associated with the financial crisis and subsequent recovery the increase from 2010 to 2011 is related to the economic expansion in emerging and developing markets the transition from mechanical to electronic systems increased semiconductor content in applications offset by slow economic recovery in mature markets sales in our total addressable market grew significantly in 2008 reflecting the expanded markets we now serve with the acquisitions of amis and catalyst that exceeded the impact of any price declines sales in our total addressable market increased to 960 billion in 2009 and to 1200 billion in 2010 and to 1428 billion in 2011 which is consistent with the trend in the worldwide market the increase from 1200 billion in 2010 to 1428 billion in 2011 is related to the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor which expanded access to japanese markets as well as motor control and inverter market spaces the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately 32 for the next three years these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 

  

recent results 

  

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 were 34423 million an increase of 49 from 23134 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the majority of which was due to revenues from our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor during 2011 we reported net income of 116 million compared to net income of 2905 million in 2010 our gross margin decreased by approximately 1200 basis points to 293 in 2011 from 413 in 2010 due to a lower margin on the sanyo semiconductor business which includes decreases from expensing of fair market value stepup on inventory of 583 million during 2011 combined with 804 million of amortization of noncash manufacturing expenses associated with a favorable supply agreement 

  

during 2011 we committed to plans to close our aizu japan manufacturing facility our probe assembly and test operations located in ayutthaya thailand and to partially close our bang pa in thailand facility see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report for further detail 

  

on semiconductor q1 2012 outlook 

  

based upon product booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we estimate that our revenues will be approximately 7200 million to 7600 million in the first quarter of 2012 backlog levels for the first quarter of 2012 represent approximately 80 to 85 of our anticipated first quarter 2012 revenues we estimate average selling prices for the first quarter of 2012 will be down approximately 2 to 3 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 for the first quarter of 2012 we estimate that gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be approximately 315 to 325 

  

business overview 

  

we are a supplier of high performance silicon solutions for energy efficient electronics our broad portfolio of power and signal management logic discrete and custom devices helps customers efficiently solve their design challenges in automotive communications computing consumer industrial led lighting medical militaryaerospace and power applications we design manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products our power management semiconductor components control convert protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our custom asics use analog digital signal processing mixedsignal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive medical military aerospace consumer and industrial customers’ unique products our data management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all types of electronic devices these various products fall into the logic analog and discrete categories used by wsts 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand has reached levels above capacity production capabilities shortages have begun to occur which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

  

new product innovation 

  

as a result of our research and development initiatives we introduced 285 new product families in 2011 there were 237 new product families in 2010 our new product development efforts continue to be focused on 

  

building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications as always it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position ourselves for continued growth as a result we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity logic analog memory and discrete products we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 

  

cost savings and restructuring activities 

  

due to the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor industry we continually evaluate our cost structure and as necessary implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our financial performance in connection with these programs we aim to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure our programs include efforts to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in 2012 our cost savings and restructuring activities will be focused on our sanyo semiconductor business and will include rationalization of manufacturing operations and the reduction of overhead and administrative costs for further details see part i item 1a “risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” located elsewhere in this report 

  

macroeconomic environment 

  

we have recognized efficiencies from implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure however the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions over the past twelve months we believe the business environment has weakened due to economic uncertainty and volatility in the united states and europe and has been further impacted by the japan earthquake and resulting tsunami as well as the recent flooding in thailand these factors have either impacted us directly or have affected our customers and suppliers which in turn has affected our business including sales our production capacity and results of operations although we view many of these issues as temporary our continuing outlook for the future will ultimately affect our future emphasis on marketing to various industries our future research and development efforts into new product lines and our segments in general 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 the amounts in the following table are in millions 

 

   

   

revenues 

  

revenues were 34423 million 23134 million and 17689 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase from 2010 to 2011 was due to revenues from our newly acquired sanyo semiconductor segment combined with an increase of 686 million from our historical segments which includes the impact from the february 2011 isbu acquisition and the june 2010 sdt acquisition our historical segment improvement was a result of a 62 increase from volume and mix partially offset by a 20 decrease from average selling prices the increase from 2009 to 2010 was due to an increase in volume and mix of sales of 337 combined with an increase in revenues from our acquisitions of sdt pulsecore and cmd of 631 million partially offset by decreases in average selling prices of 44 the revenues by reportable segment were as follows dollars in millions 

 

   

revenues from the computing and consumer products group remained even from 2010 to 2011 and increased from 2009 to 2010 in 2011 the results can be attributed to increased revenue of approximately 4 

  

from our logic products offset by a decrease of approximately 1 from our analog products in 2010 the increase of 1361 million in the segment was in large part due to the improved macroeconomic conditions as compared to 2009 coupled with a recovery period in the semiconductor cycle which resulted in volume improvements in both analog and logic products 

  

revenues from the automotive industrial medical and milaero products group increased from 2010 to 2011 and increased from 2009 to 2010 in 2011 the increase in revenue is attributed to 503 million from products related to the isbu and sdt acquisitions as well as an approximate 7 increase in asic products which was attributable to stronger demand in the mixed signal automotive end market these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue from high frequency products of 141 which was driven by lower demand in industrial and networking end markets in 2010 the increase of 1709 million can be primarily attributed to economic and semiconductor cycles strengthening in 2010 as compared to 2009 which resulted in higher revenue of approximately 25 from our asic products and a 42 increase in our memory products with the remaining increase being attributed to the 95 million of revenues from our acquisition of sdt 

  

revenues from the standard products group decreased from 2010 to 2011 and increased from 2009 to 2010 in 2011 the decrease in revenue is a result of decreases of approximately 10 from our analog standard products and an approximate 2 from tmos standard products in 2010 this increase can be attributed to the impact of our cmd acquisition which contributed additional revenue of 490 million as compared to 2009 with the remaining increase due to the economic factors and semiconductor cycle recovery as described above in our other segments these increases in 2010 were primarily in our discrete and tmos products 

  

revenues from the sanyo semiconductor products group were 10603 million during 2011 these revenues are the result of our january 1 2011 sanyo semiconductor acquisition 

  

revenues by geographic area as a percentage of total revenues were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

   

for additional information see the table of revenues by geographic location included in note 17 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor there has been a further shift in our global revenues to the asiapacific region with revenues from this region increasing to 24532 million in 2011 an increase of more than 699 as compared to 2010 

  

a majority of our end customers served directly or through distribution channels are manufacturers of electronic devices for the year ended december 31 2011 none of our customers accounted for more than 10 of our revenues one of our customers accounted for 13 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 and 11 for the year ended december 31 2009 

  

gross profit 

  

the gross profit and gross margin by reportable segment in each of the below three years were as follows in millions 

 

  

   

our gross profit was 10088 million 9560 million and 6207 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the gross profit increase in 2011 is primarily attributable to the sanyo semiconductor acquisition and an increase in our automotive industrial medical and milaero products group partially offset by a decline in the computing and consumer products and standard products group segments the 356 million increase in the automotive industrial medical and milaero products group was driven by the impact of our isbu and sdt acquisitions which contributed a combined 272 million in additional gross profit in 2011 as compared to 2010 additionally our automotive industrial medical and milaero products group is comprised of more custom products than our other segments and as a result is less impacted by general pricing pressures on commodity products the increase was partially offset by decreases in the other historic segments as sales mix and volume improvements during 2011 were outpaced by selling price declines within those segments the gross profit increases in 2010 were primarily due to improved sales volume in each of our segments as 2009 was adversely impacted by the global economic slowdown and a downturn in the semiconductor cycle which negatively impacted demand volume and pricing across all of our segments 

  

any future improvement to gross profit and margin in our sanyo semiconductor segment will be largely contingent on the execution of our manufacturing consolidation strategy discussed in note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview – cost savings and restructuring activities” in this form 10k 

  

gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased from 413 to 293 during 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to lower gross margin of our sanyo semiconductor segment which included the impact of 583 million associated with the expensing of the step up in fair market value of inventory and 804 million of noncash manufacturing expenses associated with our sanyo semiconductor acquisition for the historic segments the gross margin decline was due to lower average selling prices combined with the impact of lower factory utilization and higher commodity costs which negatively impacted the gross margin for each segment the gross margin increase from 2009 to 2010 for each of the segments was primarily due to increases in production volume driving better factory utilization and the impact of cost savings from our profitability enhancement programs combined with lower expensing of fair market value of inventory in 2010 compared to 2009 partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices during 2010 

  

operating expenses 

  

research and development expenses were 3625 million 2480 million and 1988 million representing 105 107 and 112 of revenues for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily attributed to increased expenses associated with our ongoing research and development activities associated with our sanyo semiconductor acquisition combined with an increase in labor cost related to increased head count during fiscal 2011 as compared to 2010 the increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributed to increased expenses associated with ongoing research and development activities as a result of the acquisition of the sdt pulsecore and cmd businesses increased salaries and wages due to the elimination of work furloughs or short work weeks in 2010 based on local requirements and an increase in performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals 

  

selling and marketing expenses were 1951 million 1456 million and 1209 million representing 57 63 and 68 of revenues in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase from 2010 to 2011 was primarily attributed to increased expenses associated with our ongoing sales and marketing activities associated with our sanyo semiconductor acquisition combined with an increase in labor cost related to increased head count during fiscal 2011 as compared to 2010 the increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributed to increased salaries and wages due to the elimination of work furloughs or short work weeks in 2010 based upon local requirements and an increase in performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals 

  

general and administrative expenses were 1924 million 1299 million and 1045 million representing 56 56 and 59 of revenues in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase from 2010 to 2011 was attributed to increased expenses associated with our ongoing general and administrative activities associated with our sanyo semiconductor acquisition combined with an increase in labor cost related to increased head count during fiscal 2011 as compared to 2010 the increase from 2009 to 2010 was attributed to increases in acquisition related expenses employee salaries and wages due to the elimination of work furloughs or short work weeks in 2010 based upon local requirements and an increase in performance bonus as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals partially offset by decreased stock compensation expense 

  

other operating expenses 

  

the following table shows the amounts of other operating expenses for 2011 2010 and 2009 in millions 

 

   

other operating expenses—amortization of acquisition—related intangible assets 

  

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 427 million 317 million and 290 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase of 110 million from 2010 to 2011 was primarily attributed to amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of the isbu from cypress semiconductor sanyo semiconductor and sdt the increase of 27 million from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributed to amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of pulsecore cmd and sdt 

  

other operating expenses—restructuring asset impairments and other net 

  

restructuring asset impairments and other net was 1027 million 105 million and 249 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the information below summarizes the major activities in each year for detailed information see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

2011 

  

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 248 million of asset impairment charges associated with the december 2011 announced closure of our ayutthaya thailand facility and partial closure of the bang pa in thailand facility due to the flooding that occurred these closures are expected to be completed by june of 2012 additionally we recorded a 283 million inventory writeoff as a result of the recent flooding the asset impairment charges and inventory writeoff were partially offset by the receipt of insurance proceeds of 250 million in 2011 combined with a noncash insurance recovery of 239 million which represents insurance proceeds received in the first quarter of 2012 additionally we recorded 57 million of employee separation charges and other charges of 21 million for costs incurred since the announced closures due to the halt in manufacturing at these facilities resulting from the flooding 

  

during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 615 million of asset impairment charges associated with the october 2011 announced shutdown of our aizu japan wafer manufacturing facility which is expected to be completed by june 2012 additionally we recorded 65 million of employee separation charges and 20 million of other costs for the pension trueup for employees associated with this activity 

  

in january 2011 we acquired sanyo semiconductor and announced plans to integrate certain operations of sanyo semiconductor into our existing operations primarily for cost savings purposes during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded 85 million in charges related to this integration additionally we recorded exit costs of approximately 15 million for items relating to the consolidation of factories we recorded 48 million of other charges relating to damaged inventory and other assets relating to the japanese earthquake and the resulting tsunami that occurred in 2011 

  

  

during the year ended december 31 2010 we recorded 39 million of asset impairment charges associated with the write off of a cost basis investment 35 million of employee separation costs and 01 million of exit costs associated with our 2010 acquisition of cmd and 22 million of employee separation charges associated with our 2010 acquisition of sdt 

  

  

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded 126 million of employee separation charges and 04 million of exit costs associated with our january 2009 worldwide employee reduction program 

  

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded 54 million of asset impairments on the piestany slovakia manufacturing facility resulting from a decline in the estimated fair value of the piestany property additionally we recorded 17 million of employee separation charges and 17 million of exit costs associated with the shutdown of the manufacturing facility 

  

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded a 39 million of employee separation charges associated with our reduction in workforce in belgium 

  

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded a 25 million gain on the settlement of two legal disputes 

  

during the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded a 20 million gain on the sale of intellectual property 

  

other operating expenses—goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we determined based on a decline in the business outlook that 89 million of carrying value of goodwill relating to our 2009 acquisition of pulsecore and 72 million of carrying 

  

value related to intangible assets was impaired impairment charges were recognized in the automotive industrial medical and milaero product segment 

  

there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets in the years ended december 31 2011 and 2009

depreciation and amortization expense is included in segment operating income reconciliations of segment information to financial statements is as follows in millions 

 

   

other unallocated manufacturing expenses remained flat from 2010 to 2011 however they increased from 352 million in 2009 to 558 million in 2010 primarily due to increases in the price of commodities from 2009 to 2010 

  

other unallocated operating expenses decreased from 415 million in 2010 to 149 million in 2011 due to certain cost activities being attributed to certain segments in the current year other unallocated operating expenses increased from 241 million in 2009 to 415 million in 2010 primarily due to increased costs to develop new production processes in our gresham wafer fabrication facility 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 689 million 614 million and 646 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of 349 million 337 million and 349 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our average longterm debt balance including current maturities and net of debt discount during 2011 2010 and 2009 was 10480 million 9112 million and 9716 million respectively our weighted average interest rate on longterm debt including current maturities and net of debt 

  

discount was 66 67 and 66 per annum in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources — key financing events” below for a description of our refinancing activities

other expense which is comprised of foreign translation currency loss was 89 million 69 million and 47 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the change from year to year is attributable to the strength of foreign currencies against the dollar for the periods presented net of the impact from our hedging activity 

  

loss on debt repurchase and exchange 

  

during 2011 we exchanged 1986 million in par value 1772 million of carrying value of our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 for 1986 million in par value 1764 million of carrying value of 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 series b and 159 million in cash which resulted in a loss on debt exchange of 179 million including the writeoff of 17 million in unamortized debt issuance costs 

  

during 2011 we repurchased 530 million in par value 466 million of carrying value of our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 for 562 million in cash which resulted in a loss on debt repurchase of 53 million including the writeoff of 05 million in unamortized debt issuance costs 

  

during 2010 we prepaid 1698 million of our senior bank facilities and incurred a 08 million loss on the prepayment for the writeoff of 08 million in unamortized debt issuance costs additionally during 2010 we recognized a 01 million gain on the modification of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 

  

during 2009 we repurchased 997 million of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 for 648 million in cash and the issuance of 74 million shares of common stock which had a value of 285 million based on the closing price of our common stock at the time of repurchase we reduced unamortized debt discount by 87 million and recognized a 31 million loss on the repurchases which included the writeoff of 07 million in unamortized debt issuance costs

gain on sanyo semiconductor acquisition 

  

the purchase price of sanyo semiconductor was less than the fair value of its net assets resulting in a gain on acquisition of 243 million we believe the gain recognized upon acquisition was the result of a number of factors including the following sanyo electric wanting to discontinue semiconductor operations significant losses recognized by sanyo electric sanyo electric viewing this as the best outcome for sanyo semiconductor and the fact that we expect to incur future expenses associated with the transfer and consolidation of certain operations for further discussion of the gain on the sanyo semiconductor acquisition see note 4 “acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

provision for income taxes was 229 million 128 million and 77 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

the 2011 provision of 229 million included 194 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations 32 million of additional valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets and 29 

  

million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions this is partially offset by the reversal of 26 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2011 

  

the 2010 provision for income taxes of 128 million included 135 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 27 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions this is partially offset by the reversal of 34 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2010 

  

the 2009 provision for income taxes of 77 million included 130 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and us operations and 34 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions partially offset by a tax benefit of 87 million for the reversal of previously accrued income taxes for uncertain tax positions that have been effectively settled through examination 

  

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our effective tax rate was 606 for the year ended december 31 2011 which is above the us statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due to the impact of impairment losses and other operating losses recognized during the year in foreign jurisdictions for which tax benefits have not been recognized because uncertainty regarding their future realization exists our effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory federal income tax rate for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differentials in our foreign subsidiaries we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our domestic deferred tax assets 

  

our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed in the united states which we intend to reinvest in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes

liquidity and capital resources 

  

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements offbalance sheet arrangements contingencies sources and uses of cash operations working capital and longterm assets and liabilities 

  

cash requirements 

  

contractual obligations 

  

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt operating leases pension obligations and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

 

  

      

see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for a discussion of longterm debt 

  

our other longterm contractual obligations consist of estimated payments to fund liabilities that have been accrued in our consolidated balance sheet for our foreign pension plans see note 7 “balance sheet information” and note 12 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 6529 million at december 31 2011 additionally our balance of shortterm investments was 2486 million at december 31 2011 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months total cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at december 31 2011 include approximately 5569 million available in the united states in addition to cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments already on hand in the united states 

  

we have the ability to raise cash through existing credit facilities new bank loans debt obligations or by settling loans with our foreign subsidiaries in order to cover our domestic needs 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

in the normal course of business we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

  

in the normal course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us as required for transactions such as material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases or customs guarantees a bank guarantee issued on our behalf under a nonreusable commitment credit with the bank had an outstanding amount of 36 million as of december 31 2011 the belgian bank that issued the guarantee has the right to create a mortgage on the real property of one of our european subsidiaries in the amount of 30 million but had not done so as of december 31 2011 we also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our nonreusable commitment credit totaling 91 million at december 31 2011 

  

as part of securing financing in the normal course of business we issued guarantees related to our receivable financing capital lease obligations and real estate mortgages which totaled approximately 1181 million as of december 31 2011 we are also a guarantor of sci llc’s unsecured loan with sanyo electric which had a balance of 3398 million as of december 31 2011 see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10k for further discussion 

  

for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and similarly incur expenses totaling 939 million as payments come due we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases letters of credit and guarantee arrangements 

  

in connection with the sanyo semiconductor acquisition we acquired 50 million of offbalance sheet net unfunded multiemployer defined benefit pension plan liabilities 

  

based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to intellectual property infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

  

in connection with the sanyo semiconductor acquisition we entered into an operational supply agreement that provides that if we continue to operate in certain of the sanyo semiconductor manufacturing facilities in japan using sanyo electric resources through the end of 2012 including certain seconded employees we could receive operation support credits of up to approximately 3016 million of which we have used approximately 1841 million through december 31 2011 leaving us a balance of 1175 million as of december 31 2011 there are no guarantees that we will be able to fully utilize these credits 

  

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property 

  

damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable indemnity rights to such customer for valid warranty claims 

  

from time to time we have been active in merger and acquisition activity in connection with these mergers or acquisitions we have agreed to indemnify the other party or parties to the merger or acquisition agreement for certain claims or occurrences limited in most instances by time andor monetary amounts 

  

we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

  

in addition to the above from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisers and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 

  

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 15 “commitment and contingencies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for possible contingencies related to legal matters see also part i item 1 “business—government regulation” for information on certain environmental matters 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures for strategic acquisitions and investments to repurchase our stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand and shortterm investments additionally as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 

  

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

  

   

   

   

our ability to service our longterm debt including our senior subordinated notes to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

  

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next twelve months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

  

during the ordinary course of business we evaluate our cash requirements and if necessary adjust our expenditures for inventory operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand this evaluation currently includes evaluating the impact of the recent thailand flooding and japan earthquake and resulting tsunami for example in 2011 we paid 3164 million for capital expenditures while in 2010 we paid 1889 million our current projection for capital expenditures in 2012 is 2500 million to 2750 million of which our current minimum committment is 958 million the capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives 

  

on december 23 2011 we entered into a 3250 million fiveyear senior revolving credit facility which significantly increases our liquidity and is described below under “key financing events — senior revolving credit facility” 

  

primary cash flow sources 

  

our longterm cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash our cash flows from operations is summarized as follows 

 

   

our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on among other factors our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets 

  

our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities also influences our operating cash flows and each of these components is discussed below 

  

working capital 

  

working capital fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs our working capital including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments was 8522 million at december 31 2011 and has fluctuated between 5237 million and 10027 million over the last eight quarterends although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives 

  

longterm assets and liabilities 

  

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets goodwill foreign tax receivables and capitalized debt issuance costs 

  

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties cash capital expenditures were 3164 million 1889 million and 553 million during 2011 

  

2010 and 2009 respectively we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity as a result of the thailand flooding we will also have to adjust our capital expenditures to replace the damaged equipment 

  

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans generally our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions see note 12 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our tax reserves see note 9 “income taxes” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

key financing events 

  

overview 

  

for the past several years we have undertaken various measures to reduce our longterm debt reduce related interest costs and in some cases extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility these measures continued in 2011 set forth below is a summary of certain key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years for further discussion of financing events see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

2011 financing events 

  

senior revolving credit facility 

  

on december 23 2011 we entered into a 3250 million fiveyear senior revolving credit facility the “facility” the terms of which are set forth in a credit agreement dated as of december 23 2011 “credit agreement” between us and a group of lenders the new facility includes 400 million availability for the issuance of letters of credit 150 million availability for swingline loans for shortterm borrowings and a foreign currency sublimit of 750 million we have the ability to increase the size of the facility from timetotime in increments of 100 million so long as after giving effect to such increases the aggregate amount of all such increases does not exceed 1250 million 

  

payments of the principal amounts of revolving loans under the credit agreement are due no later than december 23 2016 which is the maturity date of the facility interest is payable based on either a libor or base rate option plus an applicable rate that varies based on the total leverage ratio we have also agreed to pay the lenders certain fees including a commitment fee that varies based on the total leverage ratio we may prepay loans under the credit agreement at any time in whole or in part upon payment of accrued interest and break funding payments if applicable 

  

the obligations under the facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of the equity interests in certain of our domestic subsidiaries we are also required to pledge certain of our equity interests in certain material first tier foreign subsidiaries within a specified time after closing 

  

the credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for credit agreements of this nature the negative covenants include among other things limitations on asset sales mergers and acquisitions indebtedness liens investments and transactions with affiliates the credit agreement contains only two financial covenants i a maximum total leverage ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “consolidated ebitda” for the trailing four consecutive quarters of 375 to 100 and ii a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense for the trailing four consecutive quarters of 350 to 10 

  

the credit agreement includes customary events of default that include among other things nonpayment defaults inaccuracy of representations and warranties covenant defaults cross default to material indebtedness bankruptcy and insolvency defaults material judgment defaults erisa defaults and a change of control default the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the credit agreement we were in compliance with the various covenants contained in the credit agreement as of december 31 2011 and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants over the next twelve months 

  

we can utilize the borrowings under the facility for areas such as general corporate purposes working capital and acquisitions to date we have not borrowed under the facility 

  

december 2011 convertible note exchange 

  

on december 15 2011 we exchanged 1986 million of our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 for 1986 million of 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 series b the notes bear interest at the rate of 2625 per year from the date of issuance interest on the notes is payable on june 15 and december 15 of each year beginning on june 15 2012 the effective interest rate of the notes is 525 the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries 

  

the notes are convertible by holders into cash and shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 952381 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes subject to adjustment in certain events which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 1050 per share of common stock we will settle conversion of all notes validly tendered for conversion in cash and shares of our common stock if applicable subject to our right to pay the share amount in additional cash holders may convert their notes under the following circumstances i during the five businessday period immediately following any five consecutive tradingday period in which the trading price per 1000 principal amount of notes for each day of such period was less than 103 of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate ii upon occurrence of the specified transactions described in the indenture relating to the notes or iii on and after june 15 2016 we determined that the conversion option based on a trading price condition meets the definition of a derivative and should be bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for separately however the fair value of this feature was determined to be de minimis at the date of issuance and we continue to evaluate the significance of this feature on a quarterly basis 

  

the notes will mature on december 15 2026 beginning december 20 2016 we may redeem the notes in whole or in part for cash at a price of 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the redemption date if a holder elects to convert its notes in connection with the occurrence of specified fundamental changes that occur prior to december 15 2016 the holder will be entitled to receive in addition to cash and shares of common stock equal to the conversion rate an additional number of shares of common stock in each case as described in the indenture notwithstanding these conversion rate adjustments these notes contain an explicit limit on the number of shares issuable upon conversion holders may require us to repurchase the notes for cash on december 15 of 2016 and 2021 at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase date upon the occurrence of certain specified events each holder may require us to purchase all or a portion of such holder’s notes for cash at a price equal to the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase date 

  

the notes which are our unsecured obligations will be subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated obligations the notes will also be effectively subordinated to any of our subsidiaries’ secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 

  

acquisition note payable to sanyo electric 

  

in january 2011 sci llc as borrower and we as guarantor entered into a sevenyear unsecured loan agreement with sanyo electric to finance a portion of the purchase price of the sanyo semiconductor acquisition the loan had an original principal amount of approximately 3775 million and had a principal balance of 3398 million as of december 31 2011 the loan bears interest at a rate of 3month libor plus 175 per annum and provides for quarterly interest and 94 million in principal payments with the unpaid balance of 1227 million due in january 2018 

  

2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 repurchase 

  

during the year ended december 31 2011 we repurchased 530 million in par value 466 million of carrying value of our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 for 562 million in cash the cash payment was allocated between the fair value of the liability component and the equity component of the convertible security 

  

2010 financing events 

  

april 2010 amended indenture for zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 

  

in april 2010 we unilaterally amended the indenture for our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 the amendments include 

  

   

   

in accordance with the right of the holders of the notes to require us to purchase the notes on april 15 2010 approximately 32 million of the 994 million par value of notes then outstanding were purchased by us in accordance with asc 470 — debt the amendment was considered a substantial modification for accounting purposes therefore the 962 million original remaining debt was deemed to be extinguished resulting in a 01 million gain and new convertible debt with fair value of 985 million was deemed to be issued 

  

may 2010 prepayment of senior bank facilities 

  

in may 2010 we terminated our senior bank facilities by making a full prepayment of the 1698 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the term loan portion this amount would have been due in september 2013 subject to scheduled principal amortization and other required prepayments under the senior bank facilities we incurred no penalties in connection with this early termination 

  

the termination of the senior bank facilities also resulted in the termination of the 250 million of undrawn revolver and termination of certain ancillary agreements executed in connection with the senior bank facilities in august 1999 and amended over the years including the pledge agreement security agreement and guarantee agreement 

  

pursuant to the pledge agreement security agreement and guarantee agreement our obligations and the obligations of certain of our subsidiaries under the senior bank facilities and related documents were secured by a first lien on substantially all of our property and assets tangible and intangible including the capital stock of certain subsidiaries and substantially all of the property and assets tangible and intangible of certain of our subsidiaries 

  

the termination of our senior bank facilities negatively impacted our liquidity but provides additional financial and operational flexibility since the termination we continue to generate strong free cash flow and we 

  

remain committed to improving the capital structure of the company and shareholder value we regained this liquidity with the entry into our new senior revolving credit facility in december 2011 as described above 

  

we also service other loans see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further details relating to these loans 

  

debt instruments guarantees and related covenants 

  

the following table presents the components of longterm debt as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 dollars in millions 

 

  

     

   

our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 and our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 series b are subordinated to the senior indebtedness of on semiconductor corporation and its guarantor subsidiaries as defined in note 18 “guarantor and nonguarantor statements” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on the terms described in the indentures for such notes as of december 31 2011 we believe that we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 and our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 series b and with covenants relating to our senior revolving credit facility and various other debt agreements we believe that we will be able to comply with the various covenants and other requirements contained in such indentures and debt agreements through december 31 2012  

  

cash management 

  

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue although to a much lesser extent from manufacturing services provided to customers distributor revenue is recognized in various ways within the industry some recognize revenue upon sale to the distributor while others like us recognize revenue when the sale is made to the end customer additionally there can often be a lag in the data collection from distributors which makes the calculation of revenue recognition challenging due to our high distributor sales revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy we recognize revenue on sales to oems and electronic manufacturing service providers and sales of manufacturing services net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet given our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that it has resold the products to the end user inaccuracies in the sales or inventory data provided to us by our distributors can therefore result in inaccuracy in our reporting revenues although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

  

taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including value added and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 

  

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience our oem customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under our general agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized and are netted against revenues given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products our actual returns and allowances and warranty claims have not traditionally fluctuated significantly from period to period and our returns and allowances and warranty provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period of two years at the time revenue is recognized we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales recorded as a component of cost of revenues in addition we also offer cash discounts to customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time generally 10 days after shipment we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues based on experience with each customer 

  

freight and handling costs are included in the cost of revenues and are recognized as period expenses during the period in which they are incurred 

  

inventories  we carry our inventories not related to an acquisition at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

  

inventory acquired in the purchase of a business is stated at the lower of cost or market upon the acquisition we estimate the fair value of the inventory as of the acquisition date the methodology involves stepping up the value of acquired finished goods and workinprocess to expected sales value less variable costs to dispose for the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 577 million of the initial 577 million in the inventory stepup for acquisitions has been charged to cost of goods sold on the statement of operations since the inventory was shipped to the customer leaving no balances in inventory and inventories at distributors at december 31 2011 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense we maintain a valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets and most of our foreign 

  

deferred tax assets additionally throughout 2009 2010 and 2011 no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized as of december 31 2011 and 2010 deferred tax assets and liabilities before valuation allowances were 16192 million and 5583 million respectively and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was 16261 million and 5608 million respectively our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 

  

impairment of longlived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value when material these gains are recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

  

goodwill  we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary the second step of the test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination with the carrying amount of such goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using management’s assumptions and forecasts as of the acquisition date our methodologies used for valuing goodwill have not changed 

  

we have determined that our product families which are components of our operating segments constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill because the product families are one level below the operating segments they constitute individual businesses and our segment management regularly reviews the operating results of each product family as of each acquisition date all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date 

  

our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of 2012 however identification of a triggering event may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods 

  

defined benefit plans and related benefits  as discussed in note 4 “acquisitions” in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k we assumed 488 million of underfunded pension obligations relating to certain defined benefit plans maintained by sanyo semiconductor additionally we recorded 1449 million of estimated liabilities associated with our estimated portion of underfunded pension obligations relating to certain employees participating in the sanyo electric or its affiliate multiemployer defined benefit pension plans from which we intend to withdraw 

  

we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our foreign employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs and estimated withdrawal liabilities are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees all of these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans as of december 31 2011 a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately 270 million 

  

contingencies  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and estimable 

  

valuation of stock compensation  the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a latticebased option valuation model the lattice model uses 1 a constant volatility 2 an employee exercise behavior model based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior and 3 the treasury yield curve to calculate the fair value of shares issued for each option grant we continue to use the blackscholes optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of shares issued under the 2000 employee stock purchase plan

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

  

at december 31 2011 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 12070 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 7120 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 4950 million balance on our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of december 31 2011 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately 25 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase 

  

to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures from an accounting and economic perspective however given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 

  

we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the united states dollar as a normal part of the reporting process our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency which results in the company recording a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor we have increased our revenue expense and capital purchases in japanese yen thus increasing the effects of this translation 

  

we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a nonfunctional currency changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged the notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at december 31 2011 and 2010 was 2034 million and 755 million respectively our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies including japanese yen euros malaysian ringgit philippines peso singapore dollars canadian dollars swiss francs chinese renminbi czech koruna and british pounds sterling due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currenicies our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the us dollar for example we determined that based on a hypothetical weighted average change of 10 in currency exchange rates our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately 170 million as of december 31 2011 assuming no offsetting hedge positions

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend   

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

on january 1 2011 we acquired sanyo semiconductor and certain related assets which operated under its own set of systems and internal controls we are separately maintaining sanyo semiconductor’s systems and much of its control environment until we are able to incorporate sanyo semiconductor’s processes into our own systems and control environment 

  

other than as described above there have been no other changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2011 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 

  

13a15f and 15d15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control — integrated framework  we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2011 

  

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 excluded sanyo semiconductor because it was acquired by us during 2011 the total assets and total revenue of sanyo semiconductor represent 221 and 306 of consolidated total assets and consolidated total revenue respectively of the company as of december 31 2011 registrants are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year along with other circumstances and factors if there is not adequate time between the consummation date of the acquisition and the assessment date for assessing internal controls 

  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” of this report

subsequent to year end we completed the purchase of sanyo semiconductor and certain other semiconductor related assets of sanyo electric co ltd “sanyo electric” whereby sanyo semiconductor became our whollyowned subsidiary the aggregate purchase price of this transaction as defined in the stock purchase agreement was approximately ¥540 billion 663 million subject to certain postclosing adjustments as a result of the liabilities assumed in the transaction the consideration paid which remains subject to certain post closing adjustments was approximately ¥435 billion 520 million and is comprised of ¥118 billion in cash and 3775 million in debt we believe that this acquisition provides us with access to marketleading japanese and asian customers while providing sanyo semiconductor customers with access to advanced frontend mixedsignal and analog manufacturing and ultra high volume backend facilities ultimately we believe that the combination of sanyo semiconductor operations with our existing operations will provide us with highly complementary products customers and geographic regions 

  

we serve a broad base of enduser markets including power supply automotive communications computer consumer medical industrial mobile phone and militaryaerospace applications for our products in these markets include portable electronics computers game stations servers automotive and industrial automation control systems routers switches storagearea networks and automated test equipment 

  

our extensive portfolio of devices enables us to offer advanced integrated circuits and the “building block” components that deliver system level functionality and design solutions our product portfolio consisted of approximately 41500 products in 2010 and we shipped approximately 382 billion units in 2010 as compared to 288 billion units in 2009 we specialize in micro packages which offer increased performance characteristics while reducing the critical board space inside today’s ever shrinking electronic devices we believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products provides our customers with single source purchasing on a costeffective and timely basis 

  

as of december 31 2010 we were organized into four operating segments which also represent four reporting segments automotive and power group standard products group computing and consumer products group and digital and mixedsignal product group each of our major product lines has been assigned to a segment as illustrated in the table below based on our operating strategy because many products are sold into different end markets the total revenue reported for a segment is not indicative of actual sales in the endmarket 

  

associated with that segment but rather is the sum of the revenues from the product lines assigned to that segment from time to time we reassess the alignment of our product families and devices to our operating segments and may move product families or individual devices from one operating segment to another 

  

   

without including customers of sanyo semiconductor we have approximately 432 direct customers worldwide and we also service approximately 349 significant original equipment manufacturers indirectly through our distributor and electronic manufacturing service provider customers our direct and indirect customers include 1 leading original equipment manufacturers in a broad variety of industries such as motorola delta hewlettpackard hella schneider ge samsung continental automotive systems siemens honeywell apple dell foxconn nokia intel and sony 2 electronic manufacturing service providers such as flextronics celestica and jabil and 3 global distributors such as arrow avnet ebv elektronik future solomon enterprise and world peace see “customers” below for select information regarding customers of sanyo semiconductor

we have been doing business with 47 of our 50 largest customers for more than five years sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but do not require minimum purchase commitments most of our original equipment manufacturer customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year while our other customers including electronic manufacturer service providers generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of endmarkets including computing automotive electronics consumer electronics industrial electronics wireless communications networking military aerospace and medical sales to customers of 10 or more of revenues were as follows avnet inc 13 in 2010 and 11 in 2009 2008 2007 and 2006 

  

with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor we expect to add approximately 67 new customers most of which are japan based in addition there are 11 significant sanyo semiconductor customers that were also our customers prior to the merger with which we expect an expanded relationship sanyo semiconductor’s top 10 customers include such well known names as panasonic sony sanyo electric nintendo fujitsu cannon sharp samsung lg and delta on a post integration basis the largest sanyo semiconductor customer is not expected to exceed more than 6 of our total consolidated revenues on a fiscal year basis additionally we anticipate offering both sanyo semiconductor and existing on semiconductor products and technologies to all worldwide customers 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of i three years from the date of shipment or ii the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog” below 

  

end markets for our products 

  

the following table sets forth our principal enduser markets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each enduser market during 2010 sample applications for our products and representative original equipment manufacturer customers and end users 

  

   

   

original equipment manufacturers direct sales to original equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately 46 of our revenues in 2010 47 of our revenues in 2009 and 49 of our revenues in 2008 these customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as motorola delta hewlettpackard samsung siemens nokia intel and sony and in the automotive industry include continental automotive systems delphi trw and visteon we focus on three types of original equipment manufacturers multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core original equipment manufacturer customers the target market customers in the communications power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are original equipment manufacturers that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

  

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 45 of our revenues in 2010 42 of our revenues in 2009 and 40 of our revenues in 2008 our distributors which include arrow avnet ebv elektronik future and world peace resell to midsized and smaller original equipment manufacturers and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reasonably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 

  

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 9 of our revenues in 2010 11 of our revenues in 2009 and 11 of our revenues in 2008 our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are flextronics jabil and celestica these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many original equipment manufacturers now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace 

  

see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 16 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for revenues by geographic locations 

  

manufacturing operations 

  

we operate our manufacturing facilities either directly or through a joint venture seven of these facilities are frontend wafer sites located in belgium the czech republic japan malaysia and the united states and five of such facilities are backend assembly and test sites located in china malaysia philippines and thailand in addition to these manufacturing and assembly operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 

  

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities such information does not account for the recent acquisition of sanyo semiconductor the sizes of the locations represent the approximate gross square footage of each site’s building and include among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

  

   

we operate an assembly and test operations facility in leshan china this facility is owned by a joint venture company leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited “leshan” of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is formerly a stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 70 of leshan’s production capacity in 2010 73 in 2009 and 75 in 2008 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 70 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2011 in 2010 we incurred no underutilization charges in 2009 we incurred 27 million in underutilization charges in 2008 we incurred 08 million in underutilization charges as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan we supply die used in the production process 

  

the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations in june 2002 we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to 231 million in semiconductor operations which is in addition to the 278 million originally approved in 2004 we committed to make capital contributions of approximately 25 million to this joint venture by 2012 subject to market conditions as of december 31 2010 we had made capital contributions of approximately 164 million to this joint venture we have the ability to time these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including unisem ase kec magnachip phenitec amkor and psi accounted for approximately 29 25 and 31 of our manufacturing costs in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor we have gained various process and packaging capabilities in various sites in japan as well as back end assembly and test facilities in the philippines china thailand and vietnam we expect to consolidate sanyo semiconductor’s japanese manufacturing facilities from five sites down to two sites resulting in a footprint of roughly 2 million square feet in fabrication space and approximately 04 million in assembly and test space outside of japan we currently own or lease through sanyo semiconductor and its subsidiaries approximately 23 million square feet of production space much of the reductions in assembly and test activities in japan will be transferred into our existing sanyo semiconductor or on semiconductor facilities we expect to continue the existing sanyo semiconductor plan to shutdown the assembly and test production in their taiwan and hong kong manufacturing locations 

  

raw materials 

  

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a justintime basis and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table showing commitments contingencies and indemnities in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this report from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

sales marketing and distribution 

  

as of december 31 2010 our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 633 professionals operating out of approximately 45 offices which serve customers in 67 countries we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective internetbased applications support from our laboratories in the czech republic china and the united states through online connectivity applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions we continue to monitor our freight and logistical support operations for potential cost savings 

  

with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor we gained nine sales offices within japan along with sales offices in nine different countries throughout europe north america and asia we expect to continue using the existing sanyo semiconductor sales channels to sell the sanyo semiconductor products additionally we anticipate offering both sanyo semiconductor and on semiconductor products and technologies to all worldwide customers 

  

patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights 

  

we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor ® and our on logo we own rights to a number of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property directly related to and important to our business in connection with our 1999 recapitalization motorola assigned licensed or sublicensed to us as the case may be certain intellectual property to support and continue the operation of our business as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 1342 us and foreign patents and approximately 1132 patent applications pending worldwide our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2011 to 2029 none of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business additionally we have rights to more than 300 registered and common law trademarks our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 

  

as part of the recapitalization motorola assigned to us approximately 295 us patents and patent applications approximately 292 foreign patents and patent applications rights to over 50 trademarks previously used in connection with our products rights in knowhow relating to at least 39 semiconductor fabrication processes and rights in specified copyrightable materials in addition motorola licensed on a nonexclusive royaltyfree basis other patent trademark copyright and knowhow rights used in connection with our then existing products and products contemplated in our longrange plans we have perpetual royaltyfree worldwide rights under motorola’s patent portfolio and other intellectual property existing as of the date of our recapitalization or created in the five years thereafter the fiveyear period existing only with respect to patents as necessary to manufacture market and sell our then existing and longrange plan product lines additionally motorola provided us with a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from certain infringement claims by third parties who had granted motorola licenses as of the date of our recapitalization which assisted us in developing our own patent position and licensing program through these arrangements we have the right to use a significant amount of motorolaowned technology used in connection with the products we currently offer 

  

in connection with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor we obtained approximately 1214 us patents 1212 japanese patents and 1919 other foreign patents granted with approximately 583 us pending patents 1648 japanese pending patents and 1024 other foreign pending patents for a total of 7446 granted and pending patents acquired these patents have expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2029 sanyo electric has provided us with an indemnity umbrella to protect us from general unknown intellectual property infringement issues as well as certain known intellectual property infringement claims by third parties we have the legal right for a limited period of time to continue the use of the sanyo semiconductor name 

  

seasonality 

  

our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related endmarkets traditionally the seasonal trend consisted of a soft first half of the year with a stronger second half of the year for consumer products over the years our products have increasingly become more consumer driven in 2008 2009 and 2010 this seasonal trend for consumer products was less of a driver due to the global recession which affected demand significantly in 2009 it is unclear if and when the past pattern will return now that global economic conditions are less volatile or whether our industry will see more traditional and predictable trends and patterns 

  

backlog 

  

our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders or customer agreements that are predominately booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demands from our electronic data interface customers in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times because we record revenues on a “sellthrough” basis backlog comprised of orders from distributors will not result in revenues until the distributors sell the products ordered during 2010 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 96 and 100 of actual revenues during such quarter as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases customers tend to order products further in advance and as a result backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 

  

in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 

  

we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for generalpurpose semiconductor products like ours is highly competitive although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products see part i item 1a “risk factors — trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” located elsewhere in this report 

  

below we discuss the effects of competition on our four primary operating segments 

  

automotive and power group 

  

the principal methods of competition in the automotive and power group are new product innovation technical performance quality service and price our competitive strengths in this group are our strong technology and design capability breadth of product portfolio industry recognition as a reliable supplier and our 

  

existing market share in the automotive and power market segment our significant competitors in this market segment include elmos semiconductor fairchild semiconductor international inc freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag national semiconductor corporation stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated when compared to us several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and engineering resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions one specific competitive challenge this group faces is our small market share with certain japanese automotive customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor in january 2011 we expect this weakness to be mitigated if we are not identified as a vendor in the product design phase in most cases it is difficult to convince the manufacturer of the product to substitute our components during the production phase 

  

computing and consumer products group 

  

the principal methods of competition in the computing and consumer products group are technical performance total solution cost of ownership quality and assurance of supply our architectures for acdc conversion offer a competitive total cost of ownership and power efficient performance position to compete our architecture for our microprocessor and ddr memory controllers offers a competitive cost of ownership and performance position to compete in the computing and consumer game console market in addition the breadth of our portfolio in other support functions such as dcdc converters over voltage protection ic’s video and audio ics and standard analog and logic ic’s give us the opportunity to serve multiple requirements and allow customers to control their vendor lists more easily our significant competitors in this market include intersil corporation maxim integrated products inc texas instruments incorporated stmicroelectronics nv and power integrations inc when compared to us several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 

  

digital and mixedsignal product group 

  

the principal methods of competition in the digital and mixedsignal product group are with other customerspecific semiconductor vendors based on design experience manufacturing capability depth and quality of intellectual property ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product length of design cycle longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel 

  

our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables both inside and outside of our control these variables include but are not limited to the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies product performance and quality manufacturing yields and availability customer service pricing industry trends and general economic trends 

  

our medical and custom industrial businesses face direct competition from large diversified semiconductor suppliers that supply custom and semicustom ics such as stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated the business also faces direct competition from smaller endmarketfocused mixedsignal suppliers such as elmos semiconductor and zmd ag direct competition also comes from our target customers themselves who may have internal ic design resources dedicated to supporting the parent our timing products business faces direct competition from clock suppliers such as cypress semiconductor and integrated device technology inc and our digital asic business faces threats from fpga vendors such as xilinx inc and altera corporation as well as digital asic suppliers like opensilicon inc and esilicon corporation our primary foundry competition includes xfab semiconductor foundries ag taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd tower semiconductor ltd and magnachip semiconductor llc 

  

we also face indirect competition from assp suppliers such as microchip technology inc whose mixedsignal microcontroller products capture lowend mixedsignal asic opportunities indirect competition also 

  

comes from analog standard products suppliers such as maxim integrated products inc analog devices inc and linear technology corporation whose technical performance or offtheshelf availability may be better than what we can offer when compared to us several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 

  

standard products group 

  

our competitive strengths are in our market leading protection  filtering products the breadth of our portfolio our high quality low cost structure and supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers in addition our strengths include our strong intellectual property “ip” portfolio and our ability to leverage ip blocks across the company to develop high valueadded applicationspecific standard products “assps” 

  

the principal methods of competing in our discrete semiconductor products are through new product and package innovations with enhanced performance over existing products of particular importance are our over voltage protection and filtering portfolios esd protection tvs zeners power switching and rectification products and constant current regulators “ccrs” where we enjoy significant performance advantages over our competition our significant competitors include diodes incorporated nxp bv rohm co ltd tsps corporation infineon technologies ag vishay intertechnology inc fairchild semiconductor international inc stmicroelectronics nv and semtech corporation 

  

the principal methods of competition in the configurable analog products led drivers and eeproms spaces are product performance and new product innovations where we are specifically focusing on integrating ip eg eeprom digital potentiometer voltage reference blocks as building blocks to create high valueadded assps our significant competitors include atmel corporation stmicroelectronics nv microchip technology incorporated fairchild semiconductor international inc intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation and texas instruments incorporated 

  

research and development 

  

companysponsored research and development costs in 2010 2009 and 2008 were 2480 million 107 of revenue 1988 million 112 of revenue and 2339 million 114 of revenue respectively our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications during 2010 research and development costs increased due to increased expense associated with ongoing research and development activities as a result of the newly acquired sdt pulsecore and cmd businesses increased salaries and wages due to the elimination of work furloughs or short work weeks in 2010 based upon local requirements and an increase in performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals 

  

government regulation 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 

  

our manufacturing facility in phoenix arizona is located on property that is a “superfund” site a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to cleanup activities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of onsite solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and offsite contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the 

  

state of arizona as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter the remaining unused property and buildings are currently being marketed for sale or lease 

  

our manufacturing facility in the czech republic has ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that this facility was operated by governmentowned entities the remediation project consists primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located onsite and offsite with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded the government of the czech republic has agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries subject to specified limitations for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination based upon the information available we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 

  

our design center in east greenwich rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination when we purchased the east greenwich facility we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property based on the information available we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

  

as a result of the acquisition of amis we are a “primary responsible party” to an environmental remediation and cleanup at amis’s former corporate headquarters in santa clara california costs incurred by amis include implementation of the cleanup plan operations and maintenance of remediation systems and other project management costs however amis’s former parent company a subsidiary of nippon mining contractually agreed to indemnify amis and us for any obligation relating to environmental remediation and cleanup at this location in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” topic 410asset retirement and environmental obligations we have not offset the receivable from nippon mining’s subsidiary against the estimated liability on the consolidated balance sheets therefore a receivable from nippon mining’s subsidiary is recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2010 related to this matter we do not believe that the liability and receivable amounts are material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow 

  

we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and liability for currently known environmental conditions to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects it is possible however that future developments including changes in laws and regulations government policies customer specification personnel and physical property conditions including currently undiscovered contamination could lead to material costs 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 14307 employees of which 2598 employees are in the united states none of our employees in the united states are covered by collective bargaining agreements certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are represented by workers councils of the total number of our employees as of december 31 2010 approximately 11626 were engaged in manufacturing and information services approximately 855 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization which includes customer service approximately 465 were engaged in administration and approximately 1361 were engaged in research and development 

  

with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor our employee base will increase by approximately 6000 full time employees another approximately 2000 people employed by sanyo electric are seconded to sanyo semiconductor for varying periods of time to allow for the orderly consolidation or transition of the current sanyo semiconductor activities

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

  

from time to time we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and incur additional operating losses in the future 

  

at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses although we have recently experienced some strength in our results over the course of the past couple fiscal years reduced enduser demand price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business in order to remain profitable we must continue to successfully implement our business plan and examine and implement potentially advantageous cost reduction initiatives 

  

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns and upturns 

  

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and as a result is subject to significant downturns and upturns the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices on the other hand significant upturns have led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in some ways we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience these in the future we cannot accurately predict the timing of the current and future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these conditions might be these future conditions in the semiconductor industry could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

economic conditions including those related to the credit markets may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

  

uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in fluctuations to and reductions in consumer and commercial spending from time to time the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions reduced spending has in the past and may in the future drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which results in a negative impact on gross profit volatility in global economic 

  

conditions may adversely and materially affect our industry business and results of operations and we cannot accurately predict volatility or how severe and prolonged any downturn or recovery might be in addition to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected then our business and results of operations could be adversely and materially affected moreover volatility in revenues as a result of a unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our short term and long term strategies 

  

furthermore the united states and global credit markets could experience renewed financial turmoil if the past pressures on credit were renewed or we experience an additional global downturn we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all and we may not be able to refinance if necessary any outstanding debt when due all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures for the immediate future if our operating results falter and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition unanticipated global financial uncertainty affecting the financial and other markets could impact our business in a number of other ways including causing 1 our customers and consumers in general to defer purchases 2 our customers difficulties in obtaining sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us 3 our key suppliers to become capacity constrained or insolvent resulting in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and 4 our key suppliers to require acceleration or our customers to extend additional credit commitments any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses incurring additional debt assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 

  

in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts we face risks resulting from the expansion of our operations through acquisitions including but not limited to 1 the difficulty of integrating aligning and coordinating organizations which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures 2 risks of entering new semiconductor markets or regions of the world in which we have limited experience 3 risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems of acquired companies such as sanyo semiconductor particularly if such company is lacking adequate financial reporting and internal control systems or possess systems that are materially different from ours 4 the risk that our existing or prospective customers or customers of the acquired business may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions as we integrate new businesses and companies into our business or that they may seek to change their existing business relationships 5 challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions 6 the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets 7 difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses and 8 negative pressure on gross margins resulting from increased operating and restructuring costs associated with the target 

  

in addition current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us and as a result we could lose key employees these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel in connection with a transaction key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in the form of changeincontrol agreements acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on 

  

other equitybased compensation rights further as a result of current acquisitions such as in the sanyo transaction defined below or future acquisitions we may assume liabilities from the target’s current employee benefit plans that may require us to bring plan documentation into compliance with current law including ensuring that plans are adequately funded 

  

in connection with our acquisition activity we are required by sec rules and regulations to integrate newly acquired businesses into our financial statements the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or if they do have independent audited financial statements such statements may not be prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems which could materially impair our ability to obtain or prepare necessary financial information concerning such businesses in a format required to allow proper integration with our systems and financials in addition immediately after an acquisition and until such time as we are able to fully integrate an acquired business into our financial statements we are dependent upon the acquired business’ financial controls and systems for reporting and other financial information including projections and goals for such acquired business we may not be able to successfully prepare and file required financial statements or other financial information for the acquired business or to integrate the acquired business into our financial controls and systems and our consolidated financial statements in a timely manner failure to prepare accurate financial reports for our acquired businesses in a timely manner in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could cause material inaccuracies in our financial statements and sec filings which could result in the necessity to restate our financials or lead to unknown liabilities and possibly result in a material impact on our stock price 

  

the integration of newly acquired businesses will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management in particular in connection with the company’s recent acquisition of sanyo semiconductor and other assets related to sanyo electric’s semiconductor business the “sanyo transaction” the integration of sanyo semiconductor has and will continue to require significant internal and external coordination the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships moreover even if we were able to fully integrate sanyo semiconductor’s business operations and other assets successfully there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time delays in integrating sanyo semiconductor which could be caused by factors outside of our control could adversely affect the intended benefits of our business financial results financial condition and stock price 

  

in connection with an acquisition it is possible that we may anticipate tax savings through integration of the newly acquired business into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure as with any estimate it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be incorrect 

  

we review goodwill associated with our acquisitions for impairment on an annual basis see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 3 “significant accounting policies — goodwill” of the notes to our consolidated audited financial statements located elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information about goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to our acquisition of pulsecore in the past we recorded goodwill impairment charges related to our acquisitions of amis cherry semiconductor corporation “cherry” and the ptc business as of december 31 2010 the total remaining goodwill for the company amounted to 1912 million factors we consider important that could trigger a subsequent impairment to goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues andor increased costs we may have further material goodwill impairments 

  

in addition we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results for example in the sanyo transaction a portion of the purchase price is financed by a seven year loan with an adjustable interest rate from sanyo electric to sci llc the loan agreement contains customary events of default as well as representations warranties and covenants but does not contain any financial or negative covenants it is possible that factors outside of our control including but not limited to increases in interest rates and loss of key customers could adversely affect the intended benefits from the sanyo transaction but we will continue to have a repayment obligation under the loan agreement 

  

our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization and realizing expected synergies 

  

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing for instance if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits in addition increased competition and other factors beyond our control including economic factors may lead to price erosion lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

  

moreover we believe that we will need to improve the historic margin levels of the business and assets we acquired in connection with the sanyo transaction and successfully execute on available opportunities in order to realize the intended benefits of this transaction while we anticipate that this acquired business will benefit from expected synergies with our business and planned restructuring which could improve its historic margin levels we may not be able to successfully integrate this business within our estimated timeframes or at all to allow it to benefit from expected synergies and planned restructuring or we may have generally overestimated the anticipated benefits of expected synergies and planned restructuring furthermore sanyo electric has agreed to provide certain operational support to sanyo semiconductor for a period of time which is meant to reduce sanyo semiconductor’s existing operational costs to marketbased costs this operational support relates to among other things costs expenses and other amounts associated with seconded employees the services agreement and various lease agreements there is no guarantee that we will be able to take advantage of all of the optional support available or that following the expiration of such operational support margin levels of sanyo semiconductor will have improved to the point that we are able to operate sanyo semiconductor profitably 

  

in addition we expect that the sanyo transaction will allow for crossselling opportunities between the company and the acquired company and its customers but we cannot guarantee that these crossselling opportunities will be as great as anticipated or result in synergies as expected ultimately failure to realize anticipated synergies complete planned restructuring or executed on expected opportunities from the sanyo transaction may lead to lower revenues and lower margins than anticipated in the future 

  

the failure to implement as well as the completion and impact of our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions including restructuring activities could adversely affect our business 

  

from time to time we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to among other things significant downturns in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments as well as gains on the sale of assets and insurance recoveries 

  

in connection with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor we have gained various process and packaging capabilities in various sites in japan as well as back end assembly and test facilities in the philippines china thailand and vietnam we expect to consolidate the japanese manufacturing facilities from five sites down to two sites much of the reduction in assembly and test activities in japan will be transferred into our existing sanyo semiconductor or on semiconductor facilities we also expect to continue the existing sanyo semiconductor plan to shutdown the assembly and test production in their taiwan and hong kong manufacturing locations furthermore we currently anticipate that we will incur restructuring charges of approximately ¥6 billion to ¥7 billion 74 million to 86 million related to severance payments of seconded employees in connection with the shutdown of certain sanyo semiconductor manufacturing facilities a significant portion of these charges are expected in the first quarter of 2011 we currently expect that payments related to the restructuring will be made over the next eighteen months 

  

we cannot assure you that future cost reduction initiatives including the current restructuring plan for sanyo semiconductor will be successfully or timely implemented or will materially impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition 

  

for additional information regarding our profitability enhancement programs and cost reduction measures see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

  

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 continue to aggressively manage maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 further expand our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 rationalize our manufacturing operations 7 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 8 reduce selling and administrative expenses 9 manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands 10 actively manage working capital 11 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 12 integrate newly acquired products manufacturing capabilities and sales channels we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

  

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other things to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

  

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

  

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 

  

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

  

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies the development of new products is a complex and time consuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects moreover we may make significant investment in new products that may not be profitable or have margins as high as we have experienced historically 

  

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

  

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty we routinely purchase inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

  

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for semiconductor components is highly competitive as a result of recent economic uncertainty competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

  

the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness many of our competitors particularly larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

  

because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as from customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 

  

we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends 

  

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

  

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

  

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other things capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities upgrading or expanding existing facilities changing our process technologies or uncertainty as a result of the acquisition and integration of manufacturing facilities acquired as a result of the sanyo transaction any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

  

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing information technology and equipment to remain competitive the failure inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and such capital expenditures and commitments as well as other commitments may materially decrease our liquidity 

  

our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices we maintain certain of our own manufacturing assembly and test facilities which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 

  

we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency any such implementation however can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or in some instances to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned in the case of abandonment we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

  

in addition we have had and expect to have significant cash and capital expenditures related to the sanyo transaction for instance we have committed a significant amount of cash on hand to cover the purchase price and other costs and expenses related to the sanyo transaction although we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs and expenses related to this transaction we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with the remaining cash on hand cash equivalents and funds from external borrowings will be adequate to operate our business and otherwise satisfy our capital needs however to the extent that transaction expenses exceed projections or we are unable to generate expected cash flows our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives related to the sanyo transaction there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 

  

in the recent past we have undertaken various and material cost reduction measures which we believe have been largely successful however these reductions and any future reductions may unintentionally affect our ability to remain competitive in efficiency and productivity ultimately we may be forced to increase our future capital expenditures in unexpected ways to meet our operational needs in among other areas manufacturing information technology and equipment we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make timely and necessary investments in the areas discussed above or other areas we have not identified 

  

if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

  

product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects in addition the integration of the business acquired in connection with the sanyo transaction will require significant coordination and we cannot assure you that our existing customer relationships or sanyo semiconductor’s current customer relationships will not be materially and adversely affected as a result of uncertainty in connection with or other factors relating to the newly combined entity 

  

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

  

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including polysilicon silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

  

in addition for some of our products we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt production in material ways in addition we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 

  

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

  

a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the asiapacific region the americas and europe including the middle east similarly we maintain significant operations in these regions in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in the last few fiscal years we have benefited from relatively low effective tax rates because most of our income has been earned and reinvested in jurisdictions outside the us our effective tax rate is uncertain on an ongoing basis for instance proposed income tax regulations in the united states could under our existing tax structure significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operations and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition business combinations and investment transactions could impact our effective tax rate 

  

other activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange for instance while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

  

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

  

our success both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions such as sanyo semiconductor depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and financial personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive for example analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components in addition from time to time we have announced certain cost reductions that included the freezing of salaries and elimination of bonuses mandatory unpaid time off factory shutdowns and reduction in personnel these measures as well as any future cost reduction measures could negatively affect morale and lead to unintended employee attrition at all levels of our organization moreover we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel 

  

as employee incentives we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time we have also issued rsu’s with timebased vesting and performance based awards any difficulty relating to obtaining stockholder approval of new or amendments to equity compensation plans could limit our ability to issue these types of awards our stock price at times has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of certain of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on various registered and unregistered intellectual property assets patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

  

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty intellectual property rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such intellectual property rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses 

  

will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for intellectual property we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

  

we also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 

  

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

  

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged intellectual property rights 

  

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

  

all industries including the semiconductor industry are subject to legal claims with and without merit including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general we are involved in a variety of legal matters most of which we consider either routine matters that arise in the normal course of business or immaterial for our aggregate business operations these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers employment and labor and intellectual property we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however defense and settlement costs can be substantial even with respect to claims that we believe have no merit due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

as mentioned above from time to time we have been or may in the future be involved in securities litigation or litigation arising from our acquisitions we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation matter in which we are a party these types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future in addition we can provide no assurance that our past or future acquisitions will not subject us to additional litigation see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for more information on our legal proceedings including our pending securities class action litigation 

  

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

  

like most publiclytraded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm as we continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future 

  

we are required to incorporate sanyo semiconductor into our internal control over financial reporting by december 31 2012 currently sanyo semiconductor is a foreign corporation and was not required to comply with sox section 404 requirements the integration of sanyo semiconductor into our internal control over financial reporting will require additional time and resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs we are continuing to evaluate the impact that the integration of sanyo semiconductor following the consummation of the sanyo transaction will have in the future on our ability to maintain internal control over financial reporting however there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future failure to comply with sox including a delay in or failure to successfully integrate sanyo semiconductor into our internal control over financial reporting following the consummation of the sanyo transaction or the report by us of a material weakness may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of this transaction and the trading price of our common stock may decline in addition if we fail to remedy any material weakness our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements our financial statements may be materially inaccurate our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline 

  

see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 

  

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and 

  

worker health which among other things regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 

  

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

  

   

   

   

   

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

new legal requirements particularly with respect to health care reform could increase the cost of our employee benefits and adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations 

  

we incur significant costs to maintain competitive employee benefits to attract and retain our highly skilled personnel changes to the regulatory environment with respect to these benefits could adversely affect our business liquidity and results of operations in particular the health care reform legislation enacted by the us congress is intended to result in significant changes to the us health care system this legislation may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of the new healthcare regulations and may impair our ability to provide the same level of coverage 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

  

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

  

despite the fact that we have recently retired some of our historic debt obligations with existing cash flow we are still highly leveraged and have recently assumed more debt in connection with the sanyo transaction 

  

and therefore have substantial debt service obligations in addition we may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments from time to time the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

  

we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness from time to time may limit us along with our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next 12 months if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities moreover the debt we may incur from time to time may require collateral to secure such indebtedness which would place our assets at risk as well as limit our flexibility related to such assets ultimately we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all and we may need to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 

  

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

  

our debt agreements from time to time may contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

  

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

  

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements from time to time may contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations in addition to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock which would have a dilutive effect to then current stockholders 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

  

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter in addition to the other factors described above factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had a significant variance and we can not accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

  

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

 item 2 properties 

  

our corporate headquarters as well as certain manufacturing design center and research and development operations are located in approximately 126 million square feet of building space on property that we own in phoenix arizona we also lease properties around the world for use as sales offices design centers research and development labs warehouses logistic centers trading offices and manufacturing support the size andor location of these properties change from time to time based on business requirements we operate distribution centers which are leased or contracted through a third party in locations throughout asia europe and the americas we own our manufacturing facilities in the united states japan malaysia the philippines the czech republic thailand and belgium these facilities are primarily manufacturing operations but also include office utility laboratory warehouse and unused space additionally we own research and development facilities located in romania canada and east greenwich rhode island our joint venture in leshan china also owns manufacturing warehouse laboratory office and other unused space 

  

as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola conveyed to us the surface rights to a portion of the land located at our phoenix facility excluding the subsurface rights and conveyed buildings located at the phoenix facility these buildings do not include any treatment facilities relating to motorola’s environmental cleanup operations at the phoenix facility we executed a declaration of covenants easements and restrictions with motorola providing access easements for the parties and granting us options to purchase or to lease the subsurface rights of the land our remaining unused property and buildings at our phoenix arizona site are currently being marketed for sale or lease we will continue to use the phoenix facility as our corporate headquarters 

  

with the acquisition of sanyo semiconductor we gained various process and packaging capabilities in various sites in japan as well as back end assembly and test facilities in the philippines china thailand and vietnam we expect to consolidate sanyo semiconductor japanese manufacturing facilities from five sites down to two sites resulting in a footprint in japan of roughly 2 million square feet in fabrication space and approximately 04 million in assembly and test space outside of japan we currently own or lease through sanyo semiconductor and its subsidiaries approximately 23 million square feet of space much of the reductions in assembly and test activities in japan will be transferred into our existing sanyo semiconductor or on semiconductor facilities we expect to continue the existing sanyo plan to shutdown the assembly and test production in the taiwan and hong kong manufacturing companies 

  

we believe that our facilities around the world whether owned or leased are well maintained we believe that we have sufficient access to productive capacity to meet our needs for the majority of the products in our 

  

business lines for the foreseeable future however significant upturns have from time to time led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner 

  

see part i item 1 “businessmanufacturing operations and sales marketing and distribution” included elsewhere in this report for further details on our properties 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on information currently available management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters including the matters described or referred to in the next paragraphs will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  

securities class action litigation 

  

during the period july 5 2001 through july 27 2001 we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our former officers current and former directors and the underwriters of our initial public offering the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york “district court” as abrams v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6114 breuer v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6287 and cohen v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6942  on april 19 2002 the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint alleges among other things that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters’ excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately 300 other publiclytraded companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city which have all been transferred along with the case against us to a single federal district court judge for purposes of coordinated case management we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended and intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously the litigation process is inherently uncertain however and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us 

  

on july 15 2002 together with the other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them in addition the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual former officers and current and former directors who were named as defendants in our litigation and they are no longer parties to the litigation on february 19 2003 the district court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants in that ruling the district court granted in part and denied in part those motions as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws the district court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to replead these claims as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded the district court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well the district court also denied the underwriter defendants’ motion to dismiss in all respects 

  

in june 2003 upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation had it been approved by the district court this proposed settlement would have resulted in the dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the 

  

litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elected to participate in the proposed settlement together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants this proposed issuer settlement was conditioned on among other things a ruling by the district court that the claims against us and against the other issuers who had agreed to the settlement would be certified for class action treatment for purposes of the proposed settlement such that all investors included in the proposed classes in these cases would be bound by the terms of the settlement unless an investor opted to be excluded from the settlement in a timely and appropriate fashion 

  

on december 5 2006 the us court of appeals for the second circuit “court of appeals” issued a decision in in re initial public offering securities litigation that six purported class action lawsuits containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted against us could not be certified as class actions due in part to the court of appeals’ determination that individual issues of reliance and knowledge would predominate over issues common to the proposed classes on january 8 2007 the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking rehearing en banc of this ruling on april 6 2007 the court of appeals denied the plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing of the court of appeals’ december 5 2006 ruling the court of appeals however noted that the plaintiffs remained free to ask the district court to certify classes different from the ones originally proposed which might meet the standards for class certification that the court of appeals articulated in its december 5 2006 decision in light of the court of appeals’ december 5 2006 decision regarding certification of the plaintiffs’ claims the district court entered an order on june 25 2007 terminating the proposed settlement between the plaintiffs and the issuers including us 

  

on august 14 2007 the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in the six focus cases the issuer defendants and the underwriter defendants separately moved to dismiss the claims against them in the amended complaints in the six focus cases on march 26 2008 the district court issued an order in which it denied in substantial part the motions to dismiss the amended complaints in the six focus cases 

  

on february 25 2009 the parties advised the district court that they had reached an agreementinprinciple to settle the litigation in its entirety a stipulation of settlement was filed with the district court on april 2 2009 on june 9 2009 the district court preliminarily approved the proposed global settlement notice was provided to the class and a settlement fairness hearing at which members of the class had an opportunity to object to the proposed settlement was held on september 10 2009 on october 6 2009 the district court issued an order granting final approval to the settlement ten appeals were filed objecting to the definition of the settlement class and fairness of the settlement five of which have been dismissed with prejudice two appeal briefs have been filed by the remaining objector groups and those appeals remain pending the settlement calls for a total payment of 586 million from all defendants including underwriters of which 100 million is allocated to the approximately 300 issuer defendants under the settlement our insurers are to pay the full amount of settlement share allocated to us and we would bear no financial liability we as well as the officer and director defendants current and former who were previously dismissed from the action pursuant to tolling agreements are to receive complete dismissals from the case while we can make no assurances or guarantees as to the outcome of these proceedings based upon our current knowledge we believe that the final result of this action will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

intellectual property matter 

  

we face risk to exposure from claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others in the ordinary course of business we receive letters asserting that our products or components breach another party’s rights these threats may seek that we make royalty payments that we stop use of such rights or other remedies 

  

prior to the acquisition of amis by us on march 17 2008 in january 2003 ricoh company ltd “ricoh” filed in the us district court for the district of delaware a complaint against amis and other parties including synopsys inc “synopsys” alleging infringement of a patent owned by ricoh amis promptly tendered the defense of this claim to synopsys and synopsys agreed to assume the defense of the case on amis’ behalf to the extent that the synopsys software that amis licensed from synopsys is alleged to constitute the basis of ricoh’s claim of infringement the case has been transferred to the us district court for the northern district of 

  

california ricoh is seeking an injunction and damages in an unspecified amount relating to such alleged infringement the patents relate to certain methodologies for the automated design of custom semiconductors 

  

the case was scheduled to go to trial in march 2007 however in december 2006 the court issued an order staying the case pending a reexamination proceeding filed by synopsys before the us patent  trademark office “pto” challenging the validity of the patent claims at issue in this case since that time synopsys filed a total of three reexamination petitions with the pto challenging the validity of the claims at issue which the pto granted and consolidated all three reexaminations into one proceeding before a single examiner the reexamination proceeding was completed in september 2008 and the pto examiner issued a final rejection of all claims in the asserted patent over prior art ricoh has appealed that final rejection to the pto board of appeals which held a hearing on the appeal on september 29 2010 the board of appeals is expected to issue its written decision on the appeal within the next several months in april 2008 the court lifted the stay despite the ongoing reexamination proceeding in the pto in september 2008 the court granted defendants’ request to refile a summary judgment motion on noninfringement that had been vacated as moot when the stay was imposed in december 2006 on march 6 2009 the judge issued a ruling denying the summary judgment motion without prejudice because of a factual dispute over a patent claim element after an exchange of briefs by the parties related to the disputed claim element the judge held a further hearing on the matter on june 12 2009 on october 23 2009 the judge issued his ruling on the disputed claim element based on the judge’s ruling synopsys filed another motion for summary judgment on noninfringement on january 8 2010 a hearing on that motion was held on march 8 2010 and on april 14 2010 the judge granted synopsys’ motion for summary judgment on april 28 2010 ricoh filed a motion for reconsideration on the summary judgment ruling on may 28 2010 the judge denied the ricoh motion and entered final judgment in synopsys’ favor for noninfringement ricoh subsequently filed a notice of appeal on june 23 2010 and served its brief on appeal on august 31 2010 counsel for synopsys filed its responsive brief on october 29 2010 oral arguments are scheduled to occur as early as february 2011 and a decision on the appeal is likely in the spring of 2011 we believe that the asserted claims are without merit and even if meritorious that we will be indemnified against damages by synopsys and that resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

other litigation matter 

  

on december 15 2010 a lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the district of delaware captioned robert a lorber v francis p barton george h cave donald a colvin curtis j crawford phd emmanuel t hernandez phillip d hester keith d jackson j daniel mccranie robert mahoney w john nelson daryl ostrander robert h smith and on semiconductor corporation ca no 110cv01101gms the lawsuit was brought by a stockholder of on semiconductor corporation and alleges generally that 1 on semiconductor corporation’s 2010 proxy statement contained materially false and misleading information regarding our amended and restated stock incentive plan “plan” in violation of the federal securities laws 2 the plan was defective and thus any awards made pursuant to the plan would not be taxdeductible pursuant to section 162m of the internal revenue code and applicable regulations and 3 the individual defendants who are on semiconductor corporation officers and directors violated their state law fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets in connection with the adoption of the plan we have moved to dismiss the lawsuit we deny the substantive allegations made in the lawsuit and intend to vigorously defend against them while we make no assurances or guarantees as to the outcome of this proceeding based upon our current knowledge we believe that the final result of this action will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

industry overview 

  

according to wsts worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 3004 billion in 2010 an increase of 365 from 2201 billion in 2009 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market exclusive of the results from our sanyo transaction since 2006 

  

  

    

worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by 25 in 2008 decreased by 160 in 2009 and grew by 365 in 2010 following a pattern consistent with the movements in the global economy sales in our total 

  

addressable market grew significantly in 2008 reflecting the expanded markets we now serve with the acquisitions of amis and catalyst that exceeded the impact of any price declines sales in our total addressable market dropped to 493 billion in 2009 and returned to 753 billion in 2010 exhibiting slightly more volatility than the whole industry the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately 28 for the next three years these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 

  

recent results 

  

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 were 23134 million an increase of 308 from 17689 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the majority of which was due to an increase in volume and mix of products sold during 2010 during 2010 we reported net income of 2905 million compared to 610 million in 2009 our gross margin increased by approximately 620 basis points to 413 in 2010 from 351 in 2009 the primary reason for the increase is attributable to increases in volume driving better factory utilization cost savings from profitability enhancement programs and a lower amount of expensing of fair market value step up of inventory acquired in business acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of 44 

  

outlook 

  

on semiconductor q1 2011 outlook excluding expected results of sanyo semiconductor 

  

based on current booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we anticipate that revenues will be approximately 5700 million to 5900 million in the first quarter of 2011 backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of 2011 represent over 90 of our anticipated first quarter 2011 revenues we estimate average selling prices for the first quarter of 2011 will be down approximately 1 to 2 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 we estimate cash capital expenditures of approximately 700 million to 800 million in the first quarter of 2011 of which 100 million to 200 million is related to carry forwards from 2010 

  

for the first quarter of 2011 we estimate gross profit as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 400 to 410 for the first quarter of 2011 we estimate total operating expenses of approximately 1370 million to 1410 million which includes amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles assets restructuring and other charges of approximately 100 million 

  

we anticipate interest expense net of interest income and other will be approximately 190 million which includes noncash interest expense of approximately 90 million relating to our convertible senior subordinated notes we estimate the provision for income taxes to be approximately 40 million in the first quarter of 2011 with cash payments of income taxes to be approximately 30 million in the first quarter of 2011 we also estimate sharebased compensation expense of approximately 110 million to 130 million in the first quarter of 2011 which is included within operating expense above 

  

on semiconductor q1 2011 outlook incremental for sanyo semiconductor 

  

in addition we anticipate sanyo semiconductor will add approximately 2600 million to 2850 million of incremental revenue to historical on semiconductor guidance above we currently anticipate that sanyo semiconductor will generate operating losses in the first quarter of 2011 from among other items purchase accounting and acquisition related costs

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand has reached levels above capacity production capabilities shortages have begun to occur which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

  

new product innovation 

  

as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives excluding the introduction of leadfree products we introduced 237 new product families in 2010 there were 247 new product families in 2009 our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications as always it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position ourselves for continued growth as a result we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity logic analog memory and discrete products we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 

  

cost savings and restructuring activities 

  

we continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and as a result we expect to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure 

  

our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on 

  

   

   

   

   

macroeconomic environment 

  

we have recognized efficiencies from implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure however the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection 

  

with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions these macroeconomic factors have affected our customers and suppliers which in turn has affected our business including sales the collection of receivables and results of operations although we view many of these macroeconomic environment issues as temporary our continuing outlook for the future will ultimately affect our future emphasis on marketing to various industries our future research and development efforts into new product lines and our segments in general 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the amounts in the following table are in millions

our gross profit was 9560 million 6207 million and 7455 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively as a percentage of revenues our gross profit was 413 351 and 363 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased during 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increases in volume driving better factory utilization cost savings from profitability enhancement programs combined with lower expensing of fair market value of inventory in 2010 compared to 2009 partially offset by a 44 decrease in average selling prices during 2010 gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to decreases in prices and the effects of lower sales volume during 2009 compared to 2008 partially offset by cost savings from profitability enhancement programs and a lower amount of expensing of fair market value step up in inventory the gross profit by reportable segment in each of these three years were as follows in millions 

  

   

gross profit from automotive and power group increased from 2009 to 2010 and decreased from 2008 to 2009 the increase from 2009 to 2010 can be attributed to increased gross profit from mosfets products of 

  

49 mixed signal automotive products of 50 ldo and voltage regulator products of 86 analog automotive products of 75 auto power products of 61 and automotive application specific standard products of 49 the decrease from 2008 to 2009 can be attributed to decreased gross profit from mixed signal automotive products of the former amis of 64 mosfets products of 39 analog automotive products of 39 ldo and voltage regulator products of 36 auto power products of 27 and automotive application specific standard products of 20 

  

gross profit from the computing and consumer group increased from 2009 to 2010 and decreased from 2008 to 2009 the increase from 2009 to 2010 can be attributed to increased gross profit from signal and interface products of 66 power switch products of 90 standard logic products of greater than 100 acdc conversion products of 55 dcdc conversion products of 67 and low voltage power products of 15 partially offset by decreases in gross profit from analog switch products of 16 the decrease from 2008 to 2009 can be attributed to decreased gross profit from low voltage power products of 43 power switch products of 42 acdc conversion products of 30 standard logic products of 48 signal and interface products of 20 analog switch products of 38 and dcdc conversion products of 42 

  

gross profit from digital and mixedsignal products increased from 2009 to 2010 and increased from 2008 to 2009 the increase in gross profit from 2009 to 2010 can be attributed to increased gross profit from manufacturing service products of greater than 100 industrial products of 87 military and aerospace products of 15 high frequency products of 22 gross profit from acquisition of pulsecore communications and high voltage products of 39 integrated sensor products of 24 and gross profit from acquisition of sdt partially offset by decreases in gross profit from foundry products of 19 and medical products of 1 the increase in gross profit from 2008 to 2009 can be attributed to increased gross profit from medical products of 81 foundry products of 32 manufacturing services products of 21 and military and aerospace products of 16 partially offset by decreases in gross profit from high frequency products of 11 industrial products of 7 communications and high voltage products of 6 and integrated sensor products of 2 

  

gross profit from standard products increased from 2009 to 2010 and decreased from 2008 to 2009 the increase in gross profit from 2009 to 2010 can be attributed to increases in gross profit from protection products of 55 rectifier products of 77 small signal products of 56 zener products of 83 filter products of 45 bipolar power products of 64 and thyristor products of 60 partially offset by decreases in gross profit from acquisition of catalyst products of 45 the decrease in gross profit from 2008 to 2009 can be attributed to decreases in gross profit from rectifier products of 37 small signal products of 25 zener products of 30 protection products of 12 bipolar power products of 35 and thyristor products of 9 partially offset by increases in gross profit from products associated with our catalyst acquisition and filter products of 12 

  

certain costs incurred during the manufacturing process are not allocated to the reportable segments the increase in unallocated manufacturing costs from 352 million in 2009 to 558 million in 2010 was primarily due to the development of new production processes in our gresham wafer fabrication facility the decrease in unallocated manufacturing costs from 437 million in 2008 to 352 million in 2009 was due primarily to underutilized factory costs 

  

operating expenses 

  

research and development expenses were 2480 million 1988 million and 2339 million representing 107 112 and 114 of revenues in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributed to increased expense associated with ongoing research and development activities as a result of the newly acquired sdt pulsecore and cmd businesses increased salaries and wages due to the elimination of work furloughs or short work weeks in 2010 based upon local requirements and an increase in performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals the decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributable to a decrease in costs related to employee wages and salaries as a result of mandatory time off and overall costsavings plans including headcount reductions in response to the economic decline a portion of 

  

proceeds received from the settlement of two lawsuits in our favor for patent infringement partially offset by increased stock compensation expense 

  

selling and marketing expenses were 1456 million 1209 million and 1344 million representing 63 68 and 65 of revenues in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributed to increased salaries and wages due to the elimination of work furloughs or short work weeks in 2010 based upon local requirements and an increase in performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals the decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributed to decreased selling and marketing activities associated with a reduction in sales commission expenses due to the decrease in revenues combined with a decrease in employee wages and salaries as a result of mandatory time off and reductions in headcount partially offset by increased stock compensation expense 

  

general and administrative expenses were 1299 million 1045 million and 1224 million representing 56 59 and 60 of revenues in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase from 2009 to 2010 was attributable to increases in acquisition related expenses employee salaries and wages due to the elimination of work furloughs or short work weeks in 2010 based upon local requirements and an increase in performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals partially offset by decreased stock compensation expense the decrease from 2008 to 2009 was attributable to decreases in employee wages and salaries as a result of mandatory time off and reductions in headcount partially offset by increased stock compensation expense 

  

other operating expenses — restructuring asset impairments and other net 

  

restructuring asset impairments and other net charges were 105 million 249 million and 262 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our individual quarterly restructuring charges are summarized below for more information see note 5 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

other operating expense — amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets was 317 million 290 million and 229 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase of 27 million from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributed to amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of pulsecore cmd and sdt the increase of 61 million from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributable to a full year of amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of catalyst and amis 

  

other operating expense — goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 

  

we monitor the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions by reporting unit annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we performed the annual impairment analysis of goodwill at the reporting unit level as of the first day of the fourth quarter by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned was estimated using the present value of the estimated future cash flows 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we determined that based on a decline in our business outlook for one of our reporting units 89 million of carrying value of goodwill relating to our 2009 acquisition of pulsecore and 72 million of carrying value of intangibles was impaired accordingly we recognized goodwill impairment charges of 89 million and intangible asset impairment of 72 million in the digital and mixed signal product segment 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined that based on current market conditions and a decline in our business outlook primarily due to the macroeconomic environment 5445 million of the carrying amount of our goodwill was impaired the goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting units was primarily from our december 31 2007 acquisition of the ptc business and our march 17 2008 acquisition of amis the remaining reporting units whose goodwill was not impaired had declines in business outlook although not significant enough to trigger impairment we recognized goodwill impairment charges of 4163 million in the digital and mixedsignal product group segment and 1282 million in the computing and consumer products segment for a total charge of 5445 million 

  

there was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended december 31 2009 

  

operating income 

  

information about operating income from our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 are as follows in millions 

  

   

depreciation and amortization expense is included in segment operating income reconciliations of segment information to financial statements is as follows in millions 

  

   

other unallocated operating expenses increased from 241 million in 2009 to 415 million in 2010 primarily due to increased costs to develop new production processes in our gresham wafer fabrication facility other unallocated operating expenses decreased from 599 million in 2008 to 241 million in 2009 primarily due to the absence of a write off of inprocess research and development during 2009 as compared to 2008 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 614 million 646 million and 799 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of 337 million 349 million and 416 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our average longterm debt balance including current maturities and net of debt discount during 2010 2009 and 2008 was 9112 million 9716 million and 9804 million respectively our weightedaverage interest rate on longterm debt including current maturities and net of debt discount was 67 66 and 81 per annum in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources — key financing events” for a description of our recent refinancing activities 

  

gain loss on debt repurchases 

  

loss on debt repurchase totaled 07 million during 2010 during 2010 we prepaid approximately 1698 million of our senior bank facilities and incurred a 08 million loss on the prepayment for the write off of 08 million in unamortized debt issuance costs additionally during 2010 we recognized a 01 million gain on the modification of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 loss on debt repurchase totaled 31 million in 2009 during 2009 we repurchased approximately 997 million of our zero coupon senior subordinated notes due 2024 for 648 million in cash and the issuance of 74 million shares of common stock which had a value of 285 million based on the closing price of our common stock at the time of repurchase we reduced unamortized debt discount by 87 million and recognized a 31 million loss on the repurchases which included the writeoff of 07 million in unamortized debt issuance costs gain on debt repurchase totaled 38 million in 2008 during the fourth quarter of 2008 we repurchased 609 million of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 for approximately 494 million the 38 million gain on the repurchase was offset by the writeoff of 05 million of proportionate share of the debt issuance costs associated with the zero coupon convertible notes see “liquidity and capital resources — key financing events” for a description of our refinancing activities 

  

income tax benefit provision 

  

income tax benefit provision was 128 million 77 million and 94 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

the 2010 provision for income taxes of 128 million included 135 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 27 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions this is partially offset by the reversal of 34 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which was effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2010 

  

the 2009 provision for income taxes of 77 million included 130 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and us operations and 34 of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions partially offset by a tax benefit of 87 million for the reversal of previously accrued income taxes for uncertain tax positions that have been effectively settled through examination 

  

the 2008 income tax benefit of 94 million included 22 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 54 million of new reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions offset by the reversal of 170 million of previously accrued income taxes for anticipated audit issues due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements our offbalance sheet arrangements our contingencies our sources and uses of cash our debt and debt covenants and our management of cash 

  

cash requirements 

  

contractual obligations 

  

on january 1 2011 we paid approximately 142 million in cash and entered into a 378 million note payable as consideration for the purchase of sanyo semiconductor and related assets included in the assets acquired was approximately 126 million in cash while we expect in the near term for sanyo semiconductor to require cash to fund its restructuring and capital expenditure requirements we believe our combined cash and cash equivalents of approximately 607 million when adjusted for the net cash payment of 16 million related to the sanyo transaction along with the expected positive cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months the table below does not contain obligations that will be assumed in connection with our acquisition of sanyo semiconductor which closed on january 1 2011 

  

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt operating leases pension obligations and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

  

   

 

     

our longterm debt includes approximately 330 million of real estate mortgages in the us 962 million of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 at par 950 million of 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 at par 4840 million of 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 at par 39 million of loans with two japanese banks 340 million of loans with a chinese bank 688 million of outstanding loans with three philippine banks a 138 million loan with a british finance company a 400 million of loan with a hong kong bank and 1155 million of capital lease obligations for purposes of the contractual obligations schedule we have shown the convertible debt at par value maturing upon the first put date see note 7 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

our other longterm contractual obligations consist of estimated payments to fund liabilities that have been accrued in our consolidated balance sheet for our foreign pension plans see note 11 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 6233 million at december 31 2010 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

  

off balance sheet arrangements 

  

in the normal course of business we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system desk top computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

  

in the normal course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us as required for transactions such as material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases or customs guarantees a bank guarantee issued on our behalf under a nonreusable commitment credit with the bank has an outstanding amount of 40 million as of december 31 2010 the belgian bank that issued the guarantee has the right to create a mortgage on the real property of one of our european subsidiaries in the amount of 30 million but had not done so as of december 31 2010 we also have outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our nonreusable commitment credit totaling 90 million at december 31 2010 

  

as part of securing financing in the normal course of business we issued guarantees related to certain of our capital lease obligations and real estate mortgages which totaled approximately 1377 million as of december 31 2010 for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and similarly incur expenses totaling 693 million as payments come due we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases letters of credit and guarantee arrangements 

  

based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party 

  

against losses due to intellectual property infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

  

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable indemnity rights to such customers for valid warranty claims 

  

we from time to time have been active in merger and acquisition activity in connection with these mergers or acquisitions we have agreed to indemnify the other party or parties to the merger or acquisition agreement for certain claims or occurrences limited in most instances by time andor monetary amounts 

  

we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

  

in addition to the above from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 

  

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report and note 14 “commitments and contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for possible contingencies related to legal matters and see part i item 1 “business — government regulation” of this report for information on certain environmental matters 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments to repurchase our stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand additionally as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 

  

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

  

   

   

   

our ability to service our longterm debt including our senior subordinated notes to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

  

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next twelve months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

  

operations 

  

our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash and our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities each of these components is discussed below 

  

working capital 

  

working capital fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs our working capital including cash was 6471 million at december 31 2010 our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents was 238 million at december 31 2010 and has fluctuated between 1013 million and 131 million over the last eight quarterends 

  

the components of our working capital at december 31 2010 and 2009 are set forth below in millions followed by explanations for changes between 2009 and 2010 for cash and cash equivalents and any other changes greater than 5 million 

  

   

the increase of 976 million of cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to 5518 million of cash provided by operations partially offset by 3357 million of cash used in investing activities and 1194 million of cash used in financing activities 

  

the decrease of 455 million in shortterm investments is the result of investments maturing as cash and cash equivalents 

  

the increase of 337 million in receivables net is the result of increased revenues at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2009 

  

the increase of 909 million in inventories is the result of increased production needs to satisfy increased demand for products during the first quarter of 2011 as compared to the first quarter of 2010 

  

the increase of 121 million in other current assets is the result of prepayments of various items 

  

the increase of 840 million in accounts payable is the result of increased purchase of property plant and equipment combined with an increase in purchases for production of inventory during the fourth quarter of 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 

  

the increase of 271 million in accrued expenses is the result of increases in accrued bonus and accrued payroll 

  

the increase of 507 million in deferred income on sales to distributors is the result of increased inventories at our distributors 

  

the decrease of 699 million in current portion of longterm debt was primarily due to the reclassification of the principal balance of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes to longterm debt as a result 

  

of the amendment to the notes which modified the next potential call option to be on april 15 2012 partially offset by new short term financing and capital leases 

  

longterm assets and liabilities 

  

our longterm assets consist primarily of restricted cash property plant and equipment intangible assets goodwill foreign tax receivables and capitalized debt issuance costs 

  

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties capital expenditures were 1889 million 553 million and 950 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

  

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans generally our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions see note 11 “employee benefit plans” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our tax reserves see note 8 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

in accordance with the right of the holders of the notes to require us to purchase the notes on april 15 2010 approximately 32 million of the 994 million par value of notes then outstanding were purchased by us in accordance with asc 470 — debt the amendment was considered a substantial modification for accounting purposes therefore the 962 million original remaining debt was deemed to be extinguished resulting in a 01 million gain and new convertible debt with fair value of 985 million was deemed to be issued 

  

asc 470 requires the issuer of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument thus the liability component of the new convertible debt was recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using a discount rate equivalent to the borrowing rate at the date of the modification of the convertible notes for similar debt instruments without conversion feature the equity component of the new convertible debt was recorded as additional paid in capital and represents the difference between the fair value of the modified convertible notes and the liability component it also requires an accretion of the debt discount resulting from the allocation of a portion of the modified fair value to equity over the life of the convertible notes which is expected to be the next put date as a result we recognized 133 million of debt discount which will be amortized through april 2012

the termination of the senior bank facilities also resulted in the termination of the 250 million of undrawn revolver and termination of certain ancillary agreements executed in connection with the senior bank facilities in august 1999 and amended over the years including the pledge agreement security agreement and guarantee agreement

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america note 3 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contains a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue although to a much lesser extent from manufacturing services provided to customers distributor revenue is recognized in various ways within the industry some recognize revenue upon sale to the distributor while others like us recognize the revenue when the sale is made to the end customer additionally there can often be a lag in the data collection from distributors which makes the calculation of revenue recognition challenging due to our high distributor sales revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers and sales of manufacturing services net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment the price is fixed or 

  

determinable and collectability is reasonably assured title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet given our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that they have resold the products to the end user inaccuracies in the sales or inventory data provided to us by our distributors can therefore result in inaccuracy in our reporting revenues although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

  

taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including value added and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 

  

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under our general agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized and are netted against revenues given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products our actual returns and allowances and warranty claims have not traditionally fluctuated significantly from period to period and our returns and allowances and warranty provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of i three years from the date of shipment or ii the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge at the time revenue is recognized we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales recorded as a component of cost of revenues in addition we also offer cash discounts to customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time generally 10 days after shipment we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues based on experience with each customer 

  

freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense during the period in which they are incurred 

  

inventories  we carry our inventories not related to an acquisition at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

  

inventory obtained in the purchase of a business is stated at the lower of cost or market upon the acquisition of a company such as catalyst amis pulsecore cmd or sdt we used management estimates to determine the fair value of the inventory as of the acquisition date the methodology involves stepping up the 

  

value of acquired finished goods and workinprocess to expected sales value less variable costs to dispose the initial 80 million in the inventory step up for the acquisitions has been expensed to the statement of operations when the inventory was shipped to the customer leaving no inventory and inventories at distributors at december 31 2010 as this inventory is shipped to customers it will significantly decrease the gross profit reported on those future sales until the inventory is completely sold 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2001 a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets additionally throughout 2008 2009 and 2010 no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized as of december 31 2010 and 2009 deferred tax assets and liabilities before valuation allowance were 5583 million and 5517 million respectively and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was 5608 million and 5504 million respectively our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 

  

impairment of longlived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value when material these gains are recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

  

goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary the second step of the test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination with the carrying amount of such goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess the company performs its annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year our methodologies used for valuing goodwill have not changed 

  

we have determined that our product families which are components of our operating segments constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill because they are one level below the operating segments they constitute individual businesses and our segment management regularly reviews the operating results of each product family as of each acquisition date all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date we determined the 

  

fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using management’s assumptions and forecasts as of the acquisition date 

  

we perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year during the first step of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill for all reporting units was recoverable however during the first step of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2010 we determined that the carrying value of our goodwill for one of our product families may not be recoverable after completing the second step of our annual impairment analysis for this one product family we recognized a total charge of 89 million from our digital and mixed signal product group 

  

as the fair value of the impaired reporting unit was 89 million a 1 change in the discount rate would have no effect on the impaired reporting unit tested 

  

additionally during the first step of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined that the carrying value of our goodwill for eight of our product families may not be recoverable after completing the second step of our annual impairment analysis for those eight product families we recognized a total charge of 5445 million of which 1282 million was from our computing and consumer product group and 4163 million was from our digital and mixed signal product group 

  

we use the income approach based on estimated future cash flows to perform the goodwill impairment test these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues gross profits operating expenses and industry trends we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach less desirable than the income approach to perform the goodwill impairment test because there are no standalone companies that exclusively sell the products that are similar to those sold by our reporting units the material assumptions used for the income approach for 2010 2009 and 2008 were five years of projected net cash flows a discount rate of 130 112 and 145 respectively and a longterm growth rate of 39 35 and 30 respectively we considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analyses 

  

the total fair value of the impaired reporting units in 2008 was 5810 million a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have impacted the fair value of the eight impaired reporting units tested by approximately 477 million a one percentage point change in the longterm growth rate would have impacted the fair value by approximately 319 million a one percent increase in the discount rate or a one percent decrease in the longterm growth rate would have required us to perform further analysis that may have resulted in an impairment charge for one or both of the reporting units with material goodwill balances that were at risk 

  

factors we consider important that could trigger a subsequent impairment review and possible impairment loss for these two reporting units include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues andor increased costs we may have further material goodwill impairments 

  

the fair value of the remaining seven reporting units were in excess of their respective carrying values as of the date of the last impairment test which was as of the first day of the fourth quarter of 2010 

  

our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed in our fourth quarter of 2011 however if any potential triggering event occurs during any future interim period an assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill may result in an impairment charge that may be material 

  

defined benefit plans we maintain pension plans covering certain of our foreign employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and 

  

assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees all of these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans for example as of december 31 2010 a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities the expense impact would be approximately 59 million 

  

valuation of stock compensation  the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a latticebased option valuation model the lattice model uses 1 a constant volatility 2 an employee exercise behavior model based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior and 3 the treasury yield curve to calculate the fair value of shares issued for each option grant we continue to use the blackscholes optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of shares issued under the 2000 employee stock purchase plan 

  

contingencies we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and estimable

in april 2010 the fasb issued asu no 201017 revenue recognition—milestone method which is included in asc 605 — milestone method of revenue recognition the asu codifies the consensus reached in eitf 0809 milestone method of revenue recognition “eitf 0809” which addresses the accounting when entities enter into revenue arrangements with multiple payment streams for a single deliverable or a single unit of accounting the pronouncement shall be applied prospectively to milestones achieved in fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after june 15 2010 with earlier application and retrospective application permitted we do not expect the provisions of asu no 201017 to have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in december 2010 the fasb issued asu 201029 business combinations topic 805 disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations “asu 201029” the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2010 early application is permitted we do not expect the provisions of asu 201029 to have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however we will have additional disclosure requirements related to the sanyo acquisition which was closed on january 1 2011 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

  

at december 31 2010 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 8888 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 7303 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 1585 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately 08 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase 

  

a majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however as a multinational business we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the 

  

related hedging instruments this strategy reduces but does not eliminate the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements for example changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure

end market for our products 

  

the following table sets forth our principal enduser markets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each enduser market during 2009 sample applications for our products and representative original equipment manufacturer customers and end users 

  

   

   

original equipment manufacturers direct sales to original equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately 47 of our revenues in 2009 49 of our revenues in 2008 and 39 of our revenues in 2007 these customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as motorola delta hewlettpackard samsung siemens nokia intel and sony and in the automotive industry include continental automotive systems delphi trw and visteon we focus on three types of original equipment manufacturers multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core original equipment manufacturer customers the target market customers in the communications power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are original equipment manufacturers that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

  

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 42 of our revenues in 2009 40 of our revenues in 2008 and 50 of our revenues in 2007 our distributors which include arrow avnet ebv elektronik future and world peace resell to midsized and smaller original equipment manufacturers and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reasonably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 

  

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 11 of our revenues in 2009 11 of our revenues in 2008 and 10 of our revenues in 2007 our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are flextronics jabil and celestica these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many original equipment manufacturers now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace 

  

see part ii item 7 “management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 17 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for revenues by geographic locations 

  

manufacturing operations 

  

we operate our manufacturing facilities either directly or through a joint venture seven of these facilities are frontend wafer sites located in belgium the czech republic japan malaysia and the united states and five of such facilities are backend assembly and test sites located in china malaysia philippines and thailand in addition to these manufacturing and assembly operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 

  

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities the sizes of the locations represent the approximate gross square footage of each site’s building and include among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

  

   

we operate an assembly and test operations facility in leshan china this facility is owned by a joint venture company leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited “leshan” of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is formerly a stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each 

  

shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 73  of leshan’s production capacity in 2009 75 in 2008 and 81 in 2007 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 70 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2010 in 2009 we incurred 27 million in underutilization charges in 2008 we incurred 08 million in underutilization charges in 2007 we did not incur any underutilization charges as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan we supply die used in the production process 

  

the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations in june 2002 we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to 231 million in semiconductor operations which is in addition to the 278 million originally approved in 2004 we committed to make capital contributions of approximately 25 million to this joint venture by 2012 subject to market conditions we have the ability to time these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including unisem ase kec magnachip phenitec amkor and psi accounted for approximately 25 31 and 22 of our manufacturing costs in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

raw materials 

  

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a justintime basis and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table showing commitments contingencies and indemnities in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this report from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

sales marketing and distribution 

  

as of december 31 2009 our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 622 professionals operating out of approximately 39 offices which serve customers in 69 countries we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective internetbased applications support from our laboratories in the czech republic china and the united states through online connectivity applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions we continue to monitor our freight and logistical support operations for potential cost savings

seasonality 

  

our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related end markets in 2007 the pattern was one of a seasonally soft first half of the year with a stronger second half of the year as our products have increasingly become more consumer driven in 2008 and 2009 this pattern was interrupted by the global recession which affected us throughout the year it is unclear when the past pattern will return after global economic conditions settle and return to more predictable patterns

our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders or customer agreements that are predominately booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demands from our electronic data interface customers in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times because we record revenues on a “sellthrough” basis backlog comprised of orders from distributors will not result in revenues until the distributors sell the products ordered during 2009 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 76 and 94 of actual revenues during such quarter as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases customers tend to order products further in advance and as a result backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 

  

in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 

  

we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for generalpurpose semiconductor products like ours is highly competitive although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products see part i item 1a “risk factors — trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” located elsewhere in this report 

  

below we discuss the effects of competition on our four primary operating segments 

  

automotive and power group 

  

the principal methods of competition in the automotive and power group are new product innovation technical performance quality service and price our competitive strengths in this group are our strong technology and design capability breadth of product portfolio industry recognition as a reliable supplier and our existing market share in the automotive and computing market segments our significant competitors in these market segments include elmos semiconductor fairchild semiconductor international inc freescale semiconductor inc infineon techno national semiconductor corporation stmicroelectronics nvand texas instruments incorporated when compared to us several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and engineering resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions one specific competitive challenge this group faces is our small market share with certain japanese automotive customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs if we are not identified as a vendor in the product design phase in most cases it is difficult to convince the manufacturer of the product to substitute our components during the production phase 

  

computing and consumer products 

  

the principal methods of competition in the computing and consumer products group are technical performance total solution cost of ownership quality and assurance of supply our architectures for ac to dc conversion offer a competitive total cost of ownership and power efficient performance position to compete our architecture for our microprocessor and ddr memory controllers offers a competitive costofownership and performance position to compete in the computing and consumer game console market in addition the breadth of our portfolio in other support functions such as dcdc converters over voltage protection ic’s video and audio ics and standard analog and logic ic’s give us the opportunity to serve multiple requirements and allow customers to control their vendor lists more easily our significant competitors in this market include intersil corporation maxim integrated products inc texas instruments incorporated stmicroelectronics nvand power integration when compared to us several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 

  

digital and mixedsignal product group 

  

the principal methods of competition in the digital and mixedsignal product group are with other customerspecific semiconductor vendors based on design experience manufacturing capability depth and quality of intellectual property ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product length of design cycle longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel 

  

our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables both inside and outside of our control these variables include but are not limited to the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies product performance and quality manufacturing yields and availability customer service pricing industry trends and general economic trends 

  

our medical and custom industrial businesses face direct competition from large diversified semiconductor suppliers that supply custom and semicustom ics such as stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated the business also faces direct competition from smaller endmarketfocused mixedsignal suppliers such as elmos semiconductor and zmd ag direct competition also comes from our target customers themselves who may have internal ic design resources dedicated to supporting the parent our timing products business faces direct competition from clock suppliers such as cypress semiconductor corporation and integrated device technology inc and our digital asic business face threats from fpga vendors such as xilinx inc and altera corporation as well as digital asic suppliers like opensilicon inc and esilicon corporation our primary foundry competition includes xfab semiconductor foundries ag taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and magnachip semiconductor llc 

  

we also face indirect competition from assp suppliers such as microchip technology inc whose mixedsignal microcontroller products capture lowend mixedsignal asic opportunities indirect competition also comes from analog standard products such as maxim integrated products inc analog devices inc and linear technology corporation whose technical performance or offtheshelf availability is better than what we can offer 

  

standard products group 

  

our competitive strengths are in our market leading protection  filtering products the breadth of our portfolio high quality our low cost structure and our supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers in addition our strengths include our strong intellectual property ip portfolio and our ability to leverage ip blocks across the company to develop high valueadded applicationspecific standard products assps 

  

the principal methods of competing in our discrete semiconductor products are through new product and package innovations with enhanced performance over existing products of particular importance are our over voltage protection and filtering portfolios esd protection tvs zeners power switching and rectification and our constant current regulators ccrs where we enjoy significant performance advantages over our competition our significant competitors include diodes incorporated nxp bv rohm co ltd tsps corporation infineon technologies ag vishay intertechnology inc fairchild semiconductor international inc stmicroelectronics nv and semtech corporation 

  

the principal methods of competition in the configurable analog products led drivers and eeproms spaces are product performance and new product innovations where we are specifically focusing on integrating ip eg eeprom digital potentiometer voltage reference blocks as building blocks to create high valueadded assps our significant competitors include atmel corporation stmicroelectronics nv microchip technology incorporated fairchild semiconductor international inc intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation and texas instruments incorporated 

  

research and development 

  

companysponsored research and development costs in 2009 2008 and 2007 were 1988 million 112 of revenue 2339 million 114 of revenue and 1330 million 85 of revenues respectively our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications during 2009 research and 

  

development costs decreased due to a decrease in costs related to employee wages and salaries as a result of mandatory time off and overall costsavings plans including headcount reductions in response to the global economic decline a portion of proceeds received from the settlement of two lawsuits in our favor for patent infringements partially offset by increased stock compensation expense 

  

government regulation 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 

  

our manufacturing facility in phoenix arizona is located on property that is a “superfund” site a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to cleanup activities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of onsite solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and offsite contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter the remaining unused property and buildings are currently being marketed for sale or lease 

  

our manufacturing facility in the czech republic has ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that this facility was operated by governmentowned entities the remediation project consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located onsite and offsite with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded the government of the czech republic has agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries subject to specified limitations for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination based upon the information available we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 

  

our design center in east greenwich rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination when we purchased the east greenwich facility we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property based on the information available we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

  

as a result of the acquisition of amis we are a “primary responsible party” to an environmental remediation and cleanup at amis’s former corporate headquarters in santa clara california costs incurred by amis include implementation of the cleanup plan operations and maintenance of remediation systems and other project management costs however amis’s former parent company a subsidiary of nippon mining contractually agreed to indemnify amis and us for any obligation relating to environmental remediation and cleanup at this location in accordance with statement of position sop no 961 “environmental remediation liabilities” which is included in asc 410 asset retirement and environmental obligations we have not offset the receivable from nippon mining’s subsidiary against the estimated liability on the consolidated balance sheets therefore a receivable from nippon mining’s subsidiary is recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2009 related to this matter we do not believe that the liability and receivable amounts are material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow 

  

we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and liability for currently known environmental conditions to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects it is possible however that future developments including changes in laws and regulations government policies customer specification personnel and physical property conditions including currently undiscovered contamination could lead to material costs 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 12887 employees worldwide we do not currently have any collective bargaining arrangements with our employees except for those arrangements such as workers councils that are obligatory for all employees or all employers in a particular industry under applicable foreign law of the total number of our employees as of december 31 2009 approximately 10367 were engaged in manufacturing and information services approximately 779 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization which includes customer service approximately 415 were engaged in administration and approximately 1326 were engaged in research and development

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

  

we have experienced declines in revenues and have incurred operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and incur additional operating losses in the future 

  

at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses although we have recently experienced some strength in our results over the course of the past couple fiscal years reduced enduser demand price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business we also currently face an environment of declining revenues uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address in order to remain profitable we must continue to successfully implement our business plan including our cost reduction initiatives 

  

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns and upturns 

  

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and as a result is subject to significant downturns and upturns the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices on the other hand significant upturns have led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner in some ways we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience these in the future we cannot accurately predict the timing of the current and future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these conditions might be these future conditions in the semiconductor industry could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

current economic conditions including those related to the credit markets may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

  

the united states and global economy is currently undergoing a period of slowdown and unprecedented volatility and the future economic environment may continue to be less favorable for the foreseeable future this slowdown has and could further lead to reduced consumer and commercial spending in the foreseeable future in addition the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions reduced spending has and may continue to drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which would have a negative impact on gross profit a continued softening in the economy may adversely and materially affect our industry business and results of operations and we can not accurately predict how severe and prolonged any downturn might be moreover reduced revenues as a result of a softening of the economy may also reduce our working capital and interfere with our short term and long term strategies 

  

furthermore the united states and global credit markets continue to experience unprecedented contraction as a result of the tightened credit markets we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all if one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails we may not be able to find a replacement which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under our credit facilities in addition if the current pressures on credit continue or worsen we may not be able to refinance if necessary our outstanding debt when due which could have a material adverse effect on our business while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures for the immediate future if our operating results falter and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition the ongoing global financial and economic crisis affecting the financial and other markets could impact our business in a number of other ways including 

  

   

   

   

   

we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses incurring additional debt assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 

  

in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts we face risks resulting from the 

  

expansion of our operations through acquisitions including but not limited to 1 the difficulty of integrating aligning and coordinating organization which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures 2 our existing or prospective customers may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions as we integrate new businesses and companies into our business or they may seek to change their existing business relationships 3 challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions 4 the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets 5 the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience 6 difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses 7 risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems including in the case of companies that we may acquire from time to time which are lacking in financial reporting and internal control systems and 8 negative pressure on gross margins resulting from the steppedup valuation of a target’s inventory current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us and as a result we could lose key employees these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel in connection with a transaction key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in the form of changeincontrol agreements acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equitybased compensation rights the integration of newly acquired businesses such as pulsecore and cmd will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships in connection with an acquisition it is possible that we may anticipate tax savings through integration of the newly acquired business into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure as with any estimate it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be incorrect moreover there can be no assurance that integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time 

  

we review goodwill associated with our acquisitions for impairment on an annual basis see “note 3 significant accounting policies — goodwill” to the notes to our consolidated audited financial statements located elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information in the past we recorded goodwill impairment charges related to our acquisitions of amis cherry semiconductor corporation “cherry” and the ptc business factors we consider important that could trigger a subsequent impairment to goodwill include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues andor increased costs we may have further material goodwill impairments 

  

in addition we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results 

  

our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization 

  

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits as a percentage of total revenues gross profit was 351 for 2009 compared to 363 for 2008 and 377 for 2007 gross profit declined in 2009 primarily due to decreases in prices and the effects of lower volume during the period partially offset by cost savings from profitability enhancement programs in 2008 the gross profit percentage declined primarily due to the sale of inventory that was written up to fair value in connection with the acquisitions of adi amis and catalyst as well as the decrease in average selling prices partially offset by cost reduction activities in 2007 the gross profit percentage declined because the decrease in average selling prices was not fully offset by cost reduction activities increased competition and other factors including current economic factors may lead to price erosion lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

  

the failure to implement as well as the completion and impact of our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 

  

from time to time we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to among other things significant downturns in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation and temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments as well as gains on the sale of assets and insurance recoveries 

  

on january 31 2009 we announced that we intended to accelerate our standalone cost reduction programs including a continued focus on the consolidation of our manufacturing operations during the first quarter of 2009 we commenced certain actions to reduce overall spending levels which continued through the second quarter of 2009 in addition during the third quarter of 2009 we announced that employees will be required to take two weeks of paid vacation during the fourth quarter of 2009 for additional information regarding our profitability enhancement programs and cost reduction measures see “part ii — item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — cost savings and restructuring activities” included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

we cannot assure you that future cost reduction initiatives will be successfully implemented or will materially impact our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition 

  

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

  

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 continue to aggressively manage maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 further expand our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 rationalize our manufacturing operations 7 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 8 reduce selling and administrative expenses 9 manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands 10 actively manage working capital 11 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 12 focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

  

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other things to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our 

  

business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

  

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

  

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 

  

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

  

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

  

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty we routinely purchase inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

  

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for semiconductor components is highly competitive as a result of the continuing economic downturn competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production 

  

overcapacity and high inventory levels although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

  

the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness many of our competitors particularly larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

  

because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 

  

we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends 

  

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

  

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

  

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other things capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

  

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing and information technology and equipment to remain competitive the failure inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

  

semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices we maintain certain of our own manufacturing assembly and test facilities which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 

  

we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency any such implementation however can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or in some instances to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned in the case of abandonment we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

  

on january 7 2009 in connection with several cost reduction measures we announced our intent to reduce 2009 capital expenditures actual expenditures were 553 million down from normalized yearly levels of approximately 130 to 140 million this reduction and any future reductions may affect our ability to remain competitive or maintain efficiency and productivity ultimately we may be forced to increase our future capital expenditures to meet our operational needs in among other areas manufacturing information technology and equipment we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in the areas discussed above or other areas we have not identified 

  

if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

  

product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

  

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including polysilicon silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

in addition for some of our products we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 

  

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

  

a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the americas the asiapacific region and europe including the middle east similarly we maintain significant operations in these regions in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in the last few fiscal years we have benefited from relatively low effective tax rates because most of our income has been earned and reinvested in jurisdictions outside the us recentlyproposed income tax regulations in the united states could under our existing tax structure significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operations and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  

other activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange for instance while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

  

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and financial personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive for example analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components in addition in january 2009 we announced certain cost reductions that included the freezing of salaries and elimination of bonuses mandatory unpaid time off factory shutdowns and reduction in personnel these measures as well as any future cost reduction measures could negatively affect morale and lead to unintended employee attrition at all levels of our organization moreover we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel as employee incentives we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time we have also issued restricted stock units with timebased vesting and performance based awards any difficulty relating to obtaining stockholder approval of new or amendments to equity compensation plans could limit our ability to issue these types of awards moreover our stock price at times has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of certain of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

  

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty patents or other intellectual property rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

  

we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 

  

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

  

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged intellectual property rights 

  

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

  

all industries including the semiconductor industry are subject to legal claims with and without merit including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general we are involved in a variety of legal matters most of which we consider routine matters that arise in the normal course of business these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers employment and labor and intellectual property we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however defense and settlement costs can be substantial even with respect to claims that have no merit due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

as mentioned above from time to time we have been or may in the future be involved in securities litigation we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any securities litigation matter in which we are party these types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for more information on our legal proceedings including our pending securities class action litigation 

  

in addition our acquisitions have subjected us to additional litigation including our acquisition of cmd in december 2009 and in january 2010 three purported class action lawsuits were filed in delaware and california against us cmd and its directors on january 19 2010 the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the three lawsuits subject to court approval and a final settlement agreement see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for more information on these lawsuits there can be no assurance that the result of these proceedings or any future proceedings that may arise out of our acquisition of cmd will not materially harm our business or adversely effect the integration of cmd into our corporate structure 

  

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

  

like most publiclytraded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm as we continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future we have not been able to ascertain the impact that the integration of cmd will have in the future on our ability to maintain internal control over financial reporting there can be no assurance that our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future if internal controls over financial reporting are materially deficient we may experience a loss of public confidence which could have a material adverse effect on its business and stock price 

  

see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 

  

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other things regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 

  

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

  

   

   

   

   

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in particular through our amis subsidiary we are subject to warranty and product liability claims relating to the medical market that are disproportional to the revenue we receive from our customers who incorporate our products into their goods or products in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

  

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

  

we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations in addition we may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

  

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness currently limit us along with our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next 12 months if we incur additional debt 

  

the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities moreover some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness ultimately we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all and we may need to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 

  

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

  

our debt agreements contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

  

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

  

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic 

  

competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

  

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had a significant variance and we can not accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

  

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

none 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

in the united states our corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing design center and research and development operations are located in approximately 126 million square feet of building space on property that we own in phoenix arizona we also lease properties around the world for use as sales offices design centers research and development labs warehouses logistic centers trading offices and manufacturing support the size andor location of these properties change from time to time based on business requirements we operate distribution centers which are leased or contracted through a third party in locations throughout asia europe 

  

and the americas we own our manufacturing facilities in the united states japan malaysia the philippines the czech republic thailand and belgium these facilities are primarily manufacturing operations but also include office utility laboratory warehouse and unused space additionally we own research and development facilities located in romania canada and east greenwich rode island our joint venture in leshan china also owns manufacturing warehouse laboratory office and unused space 

  

as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola conveyed to us the surface rights to a portion of the land located at our phoenix facility excluding the subsurface rights and conveyed buildings located at the phoenix facility these buildings do not include any treatment facilities relating to motorola’s environmental cleanup operations at the phoenix facility we executed a declaration of covenants easements and restrictions with motorola providing access easements for the parties and granting us options to purchase or to lease the subsurface rights of the land our remaining unused property and buildings at our phoenix arizona site are currently being marketed for sale or lease we will continue to use the phoenix facility as our corporate headquarters as previously announced on our form 8ks filed with the sec on january 9 2009 and on february 4 2009 as one of the cost reduction measures we will be closing our remaining phoenix wafer fabrication facility and transferring production to other sites within the company’s infrastructure 

  

we believe that our facilities around the world whether owned or leased are well maintained we believe that we have sufficient access to productive capacity to meet our needs for the majority of the products in our business lines for the foreseeable future however significant upturns have led to increased customer demand for our products and the risk of not being able to meet this demand in a timely and cost efficient manner 

  

we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and similar assets of each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries but no more than 65 of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries held by them to secure our senior bank facilities 

  

see part i item 1 “manufacturing operations” included elsewhere in this report for further details on our properties 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on information currently available management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters including the matters described or referred to in the next paragraphs will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  

securities class action litigation 

  

during the period july 5 2001 through july 27 2001 we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our former officers current and former directors and the underwriters of our initial public offering the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york “district court” as abrams v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6114 breuer v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6287 and cohen v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6942 on april 19 2002 the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint alleges among other things that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters’ excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions 

  

of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately 300 other publiclytraded companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city which have all been transferred along with the case against us to a single federal district court judge for purposes of coordinated case management we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended and intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously the litigation process is inherently uncertain however and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us 

  

on july 15 2002 together with the other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them in addition the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual former officers and current and former directors who were named as defendants in our litigation and they are no longer parties to the litigation on february 19 2003 the district court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants in that ruling the district court granted in part and denied in part those motions as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws the district court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to replead these claims as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded the district court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well the district court also denied the underwriter defendants’ motion to dismiss in all respects 

  

in june 2003 upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation had it been approved by the district court this proposed settlement would have resulted in the dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elected to participate in the proposed settlement together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants this proposed issuer settlement was conditioned on among other things a ruling by the district court that the claims against us and against the other issuers who had agreed to the settlement would be certified for class action treatment for purposes of the proposed settlement such that all investors included in the proposed classes in these cases would be bound by the terms of the settlement unless an investor opted to be excluded from the settlement in a timely and appropriate fashion 

  

on december 5 2006 the us court of appeals for the second circuit “court of appeals” issued a decision in in re initial public offering securities litigation that six purported class action lawsuits containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted against us could not be certified as class actions due in part to the court of appeals’ determination that individual issues of reliance and knowledge would predominate over issues common to the proposed classes on january 8 2007 the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking rehearing en banc of this ruling on april 6 2007 the court of appeals denied the plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing of the court of appeals’ december 5 2006 ruling the court of appeals however noted that the plaintiffs remained free to ask the district court to certify classes different from the ones originally proposed which might meet the standards for class certification that the court of appeals articulated in its december 5 2006 decision in light of the court of appeals’ december 5 2006 decision regarding certification of the plaintiffs’ claims the district court entered an order on june 25 2007 terminating the proposed settlement between the plaintiffs and the issuers including us 

  

on august 14 2007 the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in the six focus cases the issuer defendants and the underwriter defendants separately moved to dismiss the claims against them in the amended complaints in the six focus cases on march 26 2008 the district court issued an order in which it denied in substantial part the options to dismiss the amended complaints in the six focus cases 

  

on february 25 2009 the parties advised the district court that they have reached an agreementinprinciple to settle the litigation in its entirety a stipulation of settlement was filed with the district 

  

court on april 2 2009 on june 9 2009 the district court preliminarily approved the proposed global settlement notice was provided to the class and a settlement fairness hearing at which members of the class had an opportunity to object to the proposed settlement was held on september 10 2009 on october 6 2009 the district court issued an order granting final approval to the settlement several appeals have been filed objecting to the definition of the settlement class and fairness of the settlement and those appeals remain pending the settlement calls for a total payment of 586 million from all defendants including underwriters of which 100 million is allocated to the approximately 300 issuer defendants under the settlement our insurers are to pay the full amount of settlement share allocated to us and we would bear no financial liability we as well as the officer and director defendants current and former who were previously dismissed from the action pursuant to tolling agreements are to receive complete dismissals from the case while we can make no assurances or guarantees as to the outcome of these proceedings based upon our current knowledge we believe that the final result of this action will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

other litigation 

  

on january 27 2010 we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of cmd through a cash tender offer of 470 per share which was then followed by the merger of purchaser defined below and cmd in accordance with the december 14 2009 definitive merger agreement “merger agreement” which we previously announced we had entered into with cmd “transaction” shortly after we signed the merger agreement and announced the tender offer we were named as a defendant in three purported class action lawsuits described below filed in california and delaware against us cmd cmd’s board of directors and pac10 acquisition corporation a direct whollyowned subsidiary of ours “purchaser” 

  

on december 14 2009 a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the superior court of santa clara county california captioned robert varrenti et al v robert dickinson edward ross john sprague david wittrock david sear jon castor john fichthorn j michael gullard kenneth potashner california micro devices on semiconductor corporation and pac10 acquisition corporation no 109cv159469 on december 29 2009 the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on december 21 2009 a second purported class action lawsuit was filed in the court of chancery in the state of delaware captioned annamarie medeiros et al v california micro devices jon s castor robert v dickinson edward c ross john fichthorn j michael gullard kenneth potashner david l wittrock pac10 acquisition corporation and on semiconductor corporation no 5159 on january 4 2010 a third purported class action lawsuit was filed in the court of chancery in the state of delaware captioned sanjay israni et al v california micro devices robert v dickinson edward c ross jon s castor john fichthorn j michael gullard kenneth potashner david l wittrock on semiconductor corporation and pac10 acquisition corporation  no 5181 all three lawsuits contain similar allegations stating generally that the proposed transaction is the product of a breach of fiduciary duties by cmd’s board of directors by failing to adequately discharge their duties in negotiating and agreeing to the transaction and that we and the purchaser assisted in that breach all three lawsuits requested an injunction enjoining the consummation of the transaction the israni complaint also included a request for damages 

  

on january 19 2010 the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding “mou” to settle the three lawsuits subject to court approval and a final settlement agreement under the mou cmd agreed to make available to shareholders certain additional information which has been completed and cmd or its insurer agreed to pay plaintiffs’ counsel for fees and expenses not to exceed 495000 we expect cmd’s insurer to pay 245000 of this total amount this payment did not affect the amount of consideration paid to the stockholders of cmd in connection with the transaction see the mou document at exhibit 101 to cmd’s form 8k filed with the sec on january 20 2010 and see a summary of the mou in our amendment no 3 to schedule to filed with the sec on january 20 2010 which summary is incorporated by reference herein 

  

the defendants maintain that the lawsuits are completely without merit nevertheless the defendants agreed to the settlement contemplated in the mou in order to avoid costly litigation eliminate the risk of delaying the closing of the transaction and because the only effect of the settlement on cmd stockholders was to provide additional disclosure while we can make no assurances or guarantees as to the outcome of these proceedings based upon our current knowledge we believe that the final result of this action will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

intellectual property matters 

  

we face risk to exposure from claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others in the ordinary course of business we receive letters asserting that our products or components breach another party’s rights these threats may seek that we make royalty payments that we stop use of such rights or other remedies 

  

prior to the acquisition of amis by us on march 17 2008 in january 2003 ricoh company ltd “ricoh” filed in the us district court for the district of delaware a complaint against amis and other parties including synopsys inc “synopsys” alleging infringement of a patent owned by ricoh amis promptly tendered the defense of this claim to synopsys and synopsys agreed to assume the defense of the case on amis’ behalf to the extent that the synopsys software that amis licensed from synopsys is alleged to constitute the basis of ricoh’s claim of infringement the case has been transferred to the us district court for the northern district of california ricoh is seeking an injunction and damages in an unspecified amount relating to such alleged infringement the patents relate to certain methodologies for the automated design of custom semiconductors the case was scheduled to go to trial in march 2007 however in december 2006 the court issued an order staying the case pending a reexamination proceeding filed by synopsys before the us patent  trademark office “pto” challenging the validity of the patent claims at issue in this case since that time synopsis filed a total of three reexamination petitions with the pto challenging the validity of the claims at issue which the pto granted and consolidated all three reexaminations into one proceeding before a single examiner the reexamination proceeding was completed in september 2008 and the pto examiner issued a final rejection of all claims in the asserted patent over prior art ricoh has appealed that final rejection to the pto board of appeals which has yet to schedule a hearing date in april 2008 the court lifted the stay despite the ongoing reexamination proceeding in the pto in september 2008 the court granted defendants request to refile a summary judgment motion on noninfringement that had been vacated as moot when the stay was imposed in december 2006 on march 6 2009 the judge issued a ruling denying the summary judgment motion without prejudice because of a factual dispute over a patent claim element after an exchange of briefs by the parties related to the disputed claim element the judge held a further hearing on the matter on june 12 2009 on october 23 2009 the judge issued his ruling on the disputed claim element based on the judge’s claim element ruling synopsis filed another motion for summary judgment on noninfringement on january 8 2010 a hearing on that motion is scheduled for march 8 2010 we believe that the asserted claims are without merit and even if meritorious that we will be indemnified against damages by synopsys and that resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

this section presents summary information regarding our industry markets and operating trends only for a full understanding of the information summarized in this overview you should read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in its entirety 

  

industry overview 

  

according to wsts worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 2201 billion in 2009 an decrease of 160 from 2619 billion in 2008 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market since 2005 

  

  

    

   

following the unprecedented semiconductor industry revenue declines of 2001 the semiconductor industry began to show signs of stability in 2002 and grew more robust in both 2003 and 2004 worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by 89 in 2006 32 in 2007 and 25 in 2008 sales in our total addressable market remained stable in 2005 reflecting increases in volume that were offset by price declines sales in our total addressable market grew in 2006 reflecting increases in volume that exceeded the impact of further price declines sales in our total addressable market grew in 2007 reflecting increases in volume that exceeded the impact of further pure declines sales in our total addressable market grew significantly in 2008 reflecting the expanded markets we now serve with the acquisitions of amis and catalyst that exceeded the impact of any pure declines sales in our total addressable market reached 493 billion in 2009 the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately 15 during 2010 through 2012 these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 

  

recent results 

  

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 were 17689 million a decrease of 139 from 20548 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the majority of which was due to a downturn in the global economic environment during 2009 during 2009 we reported net income of 610 million during 2008 we reported a net loss of 4281 million that included a goodwill impairment charge of 5445 million our gross margin decreased by approximately 120 basis points to 351 in 2009 from 363 in 2008 the primary reason for the decrease is attributable to decreases in price and the effects of lower volume offset by cost savings from profitability enhancement programs and a lower amount of expensing of fair market value step up of inventory 

  

outlook 

  

based upon current booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we anticipate that total revenues will be approximately 5150 million to 5250 million in the first quarter of 2010 backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of 2010 were up from backlog levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2009 and represent over 90 of our anticipated first quarter of 2010 revenues we expect that average selling prices for the first quarter of 2010 will be down approximately 1 to 2 from the fourth quarter of 2009 we expect cash capital expenditures of approximately 300 million to 400 million in the first quarter of 2010 

  

for the first quarter of 2010 we expect gross profit as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 400 to 410 for the first quarter of 2010 we also expect total operating expenses of approximately 1320 million to 1360 million which includes amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets restructuring and other charges of 100 million 

  

we anticipate interest expense net of interest income and other expenses will be approximately 190 to 200 million for the first quarter of 2010 which includes noncash interest expense of approximately 90 million relating to our convertible senior subordinated notes we expect the provision for income taxes to be approximately 40 million in the first quarter of 2010 with cash payments of income taxes to be approximately 40 million in the first quarter of 2010 we also expect sharebased compensation expense of approximately 130 million to 140 million in the first quarter of 2010 

  

business overview 

  

we classify our products broadly as power analog digital signal processing mixedsignal advanced logic memory data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components we design manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products our power management semiconductor components control convert protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our custom application specific integrated circuits use analog digital signal processing mixedsignal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive medical military aerospace consumer and industrial customers’ unique products our data management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all electronic devices these various products fall into the logic analog discrete and memory categories used by wsts 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand has reached levels above capacity production capabilities shortages have begun to occur which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

  

new product innovation 

  

as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives excluding the introduction of leadfree products we introduced 247 new product families in 2009 there were 241 new product families in 2008 of which 73 were generated from acquisitions of amis and catalyst and 168 were from our existing business operations our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications as always it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position ourselves for continued growth as a result we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity logic analog memory and discrete products we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 

  

cost savings and restructuring activities 

  

we continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and as a result we expect to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure 

  

during the first quarter of 2009 in response to the economic downturn we commenced certain actions to reduce overall spending levels these actions included a reduction in 2009 capital expenditures to 553 million compared to normalized levels of between 1300 million and 1400 million a temporary hiring freeze the elimination of bonus payments during 2009 three weeks of unpaid time off for senior executives in both the first and second quarters of 2009 two weeks of unpaid time off or 4 day work week based on local legal requirements for other employees in both the first and second quarters of 2009 no annual merit increases and a reduction in worldwide personnel during the second quarter of 2009 we announced a reduction for cost savings purposes of 21 employees in belgium in addition during the third quarter of 2009 we announced among other things that employees were required to take one week of unpaid and one week of paid vacation in the third quarter of 2009 and were required to take two weeks of paid vacation during the fourth quarter of 2009 

  

our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on 

  

   

   

   

   

   

macroeconomic environment 

  

while we have recognized efficiencies from implemented restructuring activities and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure the united states and global economy is currently undergoing a period of slowdown and unprecedented volatility and the future economic environment may continue to be less favorable for the foreseeable future in addition the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions these macroeconomic factors have affected our customers and suppliers which in turn has affected our business including sales the collection of receivables and results of operations although we view many of these macroeconomic environment issues as temporary our continuing outlook for the future will ultimately affect our future emphasis on marketing tovarious industries our future research and development efforts into new product lines and our segments in general 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the amounts in the following table are in millions 

  

   

revenues 

  

net revenues were 17689 million 20548 million and 15662 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease from 2008 to 2009 was due to the drop in volume and mix of 95 combined with a reduction in average selling prices of 57 partially offset by increases in revenues from our acquisition of catalyst of 458 million or 26 the increase from 2007 to 2008 was due to revenues from our october 2008 acquisition of catalyst and our march 2008 acquisition of amis of approximately 4670 million combined with a full year of revenues from our acquisition of the ptc business from adi combined with an increase in volume and mix of approximately 60 partially offset by a reduction in average selling prices of approximately 50 the revenues by reportable segment in each of these three years were as follows dollars in millions 

  

   

revenues from automotive and power group declined from 2008 to 2009 and increased from 2007 to 2008 in 2009 this decline can be attributed to a decrease in revenues from mosfets of 24 ldo and voltage regulators of 21 mixed signal automotive products from the former amis of 7 analog automotive products of 15 and auto power products of 5 in 2008 this increase was attributed to an increase in revenues from mixed signal automotive products from the former amis and auto power products of 15 partially offset by decreases in revenues from mosfets of 5 analog automotive products of 16 and ldo and voltage regulators of 7 

  

revenues from computing and consumer products decreased from 2008 to 2009 and increased from 2007 to 2008 the decrease from 2008 to 2009 can be attributed to a decrease in revenues from power switch products of 21 standard logic products of 29 low voltage power products of 25 analog switch products of 36 ac to dc conversion products of 14 signal and interface products of 11 and dc to dc conversion products of 32 the increase from 2007 to 2008 can be attributed to increased revenues from power switch products of greater than 100 ac to dc conversion products of 8 low voltage power products of 7 and signal and interface products of 1 partially offset by decreases in revenues from dc to dc conversion products of 13 analog switch products of 8 and standard logic products of 4 

  

revenues from digital and mixedsignal products group decreased from 2008 to 2009 and increased from 2007 to 2008 the decrease from 2008 to 2009 can be attributed to decreased revenues from manufacturing service products of 71 industrial products of 20 military and aerospace products of 14 high frequency products of 14 integrated sensor products of 18 and communications and high voltage products of 1 partially offset by increases in revenues from medical products of 34 and foundry products of 4 the increase from 2007 to 2008 can be attributed to increased revenues from the acquisition of amis related products of military and aerospace industrial foundry medical integrated sensor products and communications high voltage partially offset by decreases in revenues from manufacturing services products of 30 and high frequency products of 20 

  

revenues from standard products decreased from 2008 to 2009 and increased from 2007 to 2008 the decrease in revenues from 2008 to 2009 is primarily attributed to decreases in revenues from rectifier products of 17 small signal products of 9 zener products of 24 bipolar power products of 26 protection products of 

  

6 and thyristor products of 5 partially offset by increases of revenues from our acquisition of catalyst and filter products of 40 the increase in revenues from 2007 to 2008 is primarily attributed to increases in revenues from protection products of 15 our acquisition of catalyst and rectifier products of 4 partially offset by decreases in revenues from thyristor products of 10 zener products of 5 filter products of 10 bipolar power products of 3 and small signal products of 1 

  

revenues by geographic area as a percentage of revenues were as follows 

  

   

a majority of our end customers served directly or through distribution channels are manufacturers of electronic devices in recent years there has been a trend toward moving such manufacturing activities to lower cost regions particularly in asia our shift in revenues by geographic area reflects this trend in 2007 but the acquisitions of amis reversed the trend in 2008 

  

one of our customers accounted for 11 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 6207 million 7455 million and 5905 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively as a percentage of revenues our gross profit was 351 363 and 377 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to decreases in prices and the effects of lower sales volume during 2009 compared to 2008 partially offset by cost savings from profitability enhancement programs and a lower amount of expensing of fair market value step up in inventory gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the sale of inventory that was written up to fair market value in connection with the acquisitions of amis and the ptc business from adi which had a 95 impact as well as the decrease in average selling prices of 50 partially offset by cost reduction activities the gross profit by reportable segment in each of these three years were as follows dollars in millions 

  

   

gross profit from automotive and power group decreased from 2008 to 2009 and increased from 2007 to 2008 the decrease from 2008 to 2009 can be attributed to decreased gross profit from mixed signal automotive products of the former amis of 64 mosfets products of 39 analog automotive products of 39 ldo and voltage regulator products of 36 and auto power products of 27 the increase from 2007 to 2008 can be attributed to increased gross profit from mixed signal automotive products of the former amis and auto power products of 40 partially offset by decreases in gross profit from mosfets products of 17 analog automotive products of 15 and ldo and voltage regulator products of 9 

  

gross profit from the computing and consumer group decreased from 2008 to 2009 and increased from 2007 to 2008 the decrease from 2008 to 2009 can be attributed to decreased gross profit from low voltage power products of 43 power switch products of 42 ac to dc conversion products of 30 standard logic products of 48 signal and interface products of 20 analog switch products of 38 and dc to dc conversion products of 42 the increase from 2007 to 2008 can be attributed to increased gross profit from power switch products of greater than 100 signal and interface products of 10 low voltage power products of 8 ac to dc conversion products of 5 and standard logic products of 3 partially offset by decreases in gross profit from analog switch products of 19 and dc to dc conversion products of 21 

  

gross profit from digital and mixedsignal products increased from 2008 to 2009 and increased from 2007 to 2008 the increase in gross profit from 2008 to 2009 can be attributed to increased gross profit from medical products of 81 foundry products of 32 manufacturing services products of 21 and military and aerospace products of 16 partially offset by decreases in gross profit from high frequency products of 11 industrial products of 7 communications and high voltage products of 6 and integrated sensor products of 2 the increase in gross profit from 2007 to 2008 can be attributed to increased gross profit from the acquisition of amis products including military and aerospace products industrial products foundry products medical products communication and high voltage products and integrated sensor products partially offset by decreases in gross profit from manufacturing services products of greater than 100 and high frequency products of 24 

  

gross profit from standard products decreased from 2008 to 2009 and remained relatively flat from 2007 to 2008 the decrease in gross profit from 2008 to 2009 can be attributed to decreases in gross profit from rectifier products of 37 small signal products of 25 zener products of 30 protection products of 12 bipolar power products of 35 and thyristor products of 9 partially offset by increases in gross profit from products associated with our catalyst acquisition and filter products of 12 gross profit from standard products remained relatively flat from 2007 to 2008 increases in protection products of 17 rectifier products of 11 products from the acquisition of catalyst and bipolar power products of 6 offset by decreases in gross profit from small signal products of 10 filter products of 17 zener products of 8 and thyristor products of 4 

  

certain costs incurred during the manufacturing process are not allocated to the reportable segments the decrease in unallocated manufacturing costs from 437 million in 2008 to 352 million in 2009 was due primarily to underutilized factory costs the increase in unallocated manufacturing costs from 209 million in 2007 to 437 million in 2008 was due primarily to the write off of inprocess research and development associated with our acquisitions of amis and catalyst of 271 million combined with lower underutilized factory costs 

  

operating expenses 

  

research and development expenses were 1988 million 2339 million and 1330 million representing 112 114 and 85 of revenues in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease from 2009 to 2008 was primarily attributable to a decrease in costs related to employee wages and salaries as a result of mandatory time off and overall costsavings plans including headcount reductions in response to the economic decline a portion of proceeds received from the settlement of two lawsuits in our favor for patent infringement partially offset by increased stock compensation expense the increase from 2007 to 2008 was primarily attributable to increased expense associated with ongoing research and development activities as a result of the acquisitions of catalyst 

  

amis and the ptc business from adi as well as the development of new process technologies in our gresham fabrication facility and the effects of foreign currency on wages 

  

selling and marketing expenses were 1209 million 1344 million and 946 million representing 68 65 and 60 of revenues in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributed to decreased selling and marketing activities associated with a reduction in sales commission expenses due to the decrease in revenues combined with a decrease in employee wages and salaries as a result of mandatory time off and reductions in headcount partially offset by increased stock compensation expense the increase from 2007 to 2008 was primarily attributed to increased selling and marketing activities as a result of the acquisition of amis combined with increased activity at our solution engineering centers in north america and asia combined with the expansion of our sales and marketing presence in china and the effects of foreign currency on wages 

  

general and administrative expenses were 1045 million 1224 million and 827 million representing 59 60 and 53 of revenues in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease from 2008 to 2009 was attributable to decreases in employee wages and salaries as a result of mandatory time off and reductions in headcount partially offset by increased stock compensation expense the increase from 2007 to 2008 was attributable to increases in stock compensation expense general and administrative expenses associated with the acquisition of amis and increased costs associated with amis integration activities combined with the effects of foreign currency on wages partially offset by decreased employee performance bonuses 

  

other operating expenses — restructuring asset impairments and other net 

  

restructuring asset impairments and other charges were 249 million 262 million and 30 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our individual quarterly restructuring charges are summarized below for more information see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

other operating expense — amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets 

  

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets were 290 million 229 million and zero in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase of 61 million from 2008 to 2009 was primarily attributable to a full year of amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of catalyst and amis the increase of 229 million from 2007 to 2008 was attributable to the amortization of intangibles from our october 10 2008 acquisition of catalyst and our march 17 2008 acquisition of amis 

  

other operating expense — goodwill impairment charges 

  

we monitor the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions by reporting unit annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we performed the annual impairment analysis of goodwill at the reporting unit level as of the first 

  

day of the fourth quarter by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined that based on current market conditions and a decline in our business outlook primarily due to the macroeconomic environment 5445 million of the carrying amount of our goodwill was impaired the goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting units was primarily from our december 31 2007 acquisition of the ptc business and our march 17 2008 acquisition of amis the remaining reporting units whose goodwill was not impaired had declines in business outlook although not significant enough to trigger impairment we recognized goodwill impairment charges of 4163 million in the digital and mixedsignal product group segment and 1282 million in the computing and consumer products segment for a total charge of 5445 million the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned was estimated using the present value of estimated future cash flows there was no impairment of goodwill for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2007

liquidity and capital resources 

  

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements our offbalance sheet arrangements our contingencies our sources and uses of cash our debt and debt covenants and our management of cash 

  

cash requirements 

  

contractual obligations 

  

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt operating leases pension obligations and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

  

  

     

our longterm debt includes 1702 million outstanding under senior bank facilities 994 million of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 at par 950 million of 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 at par 4840 million of 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 at par 78 million of loans with three japanese banks 460 million of loans with two chinese banks 454 million outstanding loans with four philippine banks 231 million of loans with a british finance company and 786 million of capital lease obligations for purposes of the contractual obligations schedule we have shown the convertible debt at par value maturing upon the first put date see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

our other longterm contractual obligations consist of estimated payments to fund liabilities that have been accrued in our consolidated balance sheet for our foreign pension plans see note 12 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 5257 million at december 31 2009 despite recent revenue reductions we have taken actions to lower the amount of revenues required each quarter to break even on a cash basis as such we believe that our cash flow from operations coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

  

off balance sheet arrangements 

  

in the normal course of business we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system desk top computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

  

in the normal course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us as required for transactions such as material purchase commitments agreements to mitigate collection risk leases or customs guarantees our senior bank facilities include a 250 million revolving facility letters of credit totaling 12 million were outstanding under the revolving facility at december 31 2009 one of our foreign exchange hedging agreements has a provision for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving facility is less than 25 million a bank guarantee issued on our behalf under a nonreusable commitment credit with the bank has an outstanding amount of 44 million as of december 31 2009 the belgian bank that issued the guarantee has the right to create a mortgage on the real property of one of our european subsidiaries in the amount of 30 million but had not done so as of december 31 2009 we also have outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our revolving facility and the nonreusable commitment credit totaling 130 million at december 31 2009 

  

as part of securing financing in the normal course of business we issued guarantees related to two of our capital lease obligations which totaled approximately 261 million as of december 31 2009 in addition sci llc our primary domestic operating subsidiary guarantees on an unsecured basis approximately 36 million of a loan by one of our japanese subsidiaries for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and similarly incur expenses totaling 748 million as payments come due we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases letters of credit and guarantee arrangements 

  

based on historical experience and information currently available we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to intellectual property infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

  

we are a party to various agreements with motorola a former affiliate which were entered into in connection with our separation from motorola pursuant to these agreements we have agreed to indemnify motorola for losses due to for example breach of representations and warranties and covenants damages arising from assumed liabilities or relating to allocated assets and for specified environmental matters our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and payment by us is conditioned on motorola making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract which procedures typically allow us to challenge motorola’s claims 

  

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable indemnity rights to such customers for valid warranty claims 

  

in connection with the acquisitions of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility and adi’s ptc business we entered into various agreements with lsi and adi respectively pursuant to certain of these agreements we agreed to indemnify lsi and adi respectively for certain things limited in the most instances by time andor monetary amounts 

  

we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

  

in addition to the above from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 

  

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report and note 15 “commitments and contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for possible contingencies related to legal matters and see part i item 1 “business — government regulation” of this report for information on certain environmental matters 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments to repurchase our stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand and targeted asset sales additionally as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 

  

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

  

   

   

our ability to service our longterm debt including our senior subordinated notes to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating 

  

activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

  

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us the united states and global credit markets are currently experiencing an unprecedented contraction as a result of the tightening credit markets we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through at least the next twelve months to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

  

operations 

  

our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash and our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities each of these components is discussed herein 

  

ebitda 

  

as discussed in note 8 “longterm debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report our debt covenants require us to stay within certain leverage ratios based on the consolidated earnings net income before interest expense provisions for income taxes depreciation and amortization expense for the last four quarters “consolidated ebitda” as defined under the documents for our senior bank facilities totaled approximately 3837 million for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended december 31 2009 

  

if we were not in compliance with the covenants contained in our senior bank facilities the holders of our senior bank facilities could cause all outstanding amounts as of december 31 2009 which were comprised of 1702 million of our term loan to be due and payable immediately and the 12 million of letters of credit to be fully cash collateralized if we were unable to repay refinance or restructure that indebtedness the holders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any such event of default or declaration of acceleration could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity as of december 31 2009 approximately 7276 million remained outstanding under other debt that may be accelerated based on this covenant 

  

working capital 

  

working capital fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs our working capital including cash was 5496 million at december 31 2009 our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents was 239 million at december 31 2009 and has fluctuated between 1013 million and 131 million over the last eight quarterends 

  

the components of our working capital at december 31 2009 and 2008 are set forth below in millions followed by explanations for changes between 2008 and 2009 for cash and cash equivalents and any other changes greater than 5 million 

  

   

the increase of 670 million of cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to 2769 million of cash provided by operating activities partially offset by 1263 million of cash used in investing activities and 838 million of cash used in financing activities 

  

the increase of 455 million in shortterm investments is the result of investing excess cash in investments with maturities between 3 months and one year to earn higher rates of return 

  

the increase of 721 million in receivables net is the result of increased shipments at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 

  

the decrease of 656 million in inventories net is the result of higher sales volume during the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 

  

the decrease of 53 million in accounts payable is the result of the effects of timing of payments during the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 

  

the decrease of 153 million in deferred income on sales to distributors is the result of a reduction in inventories at our distributors 

  

the increase of 980 million in the current portion of longterm debt was primarily due to the reclassification of the principal balance of our zero coupon convertible notes due april 2010 partially offset by the repayment of the belgian loan and the maturity of two of our foreign loans 

  

longterm assets and liabilities 

  

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets foreign tax receivables pension assets and capitalized debt issuance costs 

  

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity during the first half of 2010 might not be readily obtained on reasonable terms due to supply constraints capital expenditures were 553 million 950 million and 1407 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

  

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans generally our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions see note 12 “employee benefit plans” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our tax reserves see note 9 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america note 3 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contains a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue although to a much lesser extent from manufacturing services provided to customers distributor revenue is recognized in various ways within the industry some recognize revenue upon sale to the distributor while others like us recognize the revenue when the sale is made to the end customer additionally there can often be a lag in the data collection from distributors which makes the calculation of revenue recognition challenging due to our high distributor sales revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers and sales of manufacturing services net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that they have resold the products to the end user inaccuracies in the sales or inventory data provided to us by our distributors can therefore result in inaccuracy in our reporting revenues as a result of our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors we defer the related revenue and margin on sales to distributors although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

  

taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including value added and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 

  

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under our general agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized and are netted against revenues given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products our actual returns and allowances and warranty claims have not traditionally fluctuated significantly from period to period and our returns and allowances and warranty provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of i three years from the date of shipment or ii the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge at the time revenue is recognized we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales recorded as a component of cost of revenues in addition we also offer cash discounts to customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time generally 10 days after shipment we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues based on experience with each customer 

  

freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense during the period in which they are incurred 

  

inventories  we carry our inventories not related to an acquisition at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

  

inventory obtained in the purchase of a business is stated at the lower of cost or market upon the acquisition of a company such as pulsecore catalyst and amis we used management estimates to determine the fair value of the inventory as of the acquisition date the methodology involves stepping up the value of acquired finished goods and workinprocess to expected sales value less variable costs to dispose approximately 822 million of the initial 862 million in the inventory step up for the pulsecore catalyst and amis acquisitions has been expensed to the statement of operations when the inventory was shipped to the customer leaving 40 million in inventory and inventories at distributors at december 31 2009 as this inventory is shipped to customers it will significantly decrease the gross margin reported on those future sales until the inventory is completely sold 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2001 a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets additionally throughout 2007 2008 and 2009 no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized as of december 31 2009 and 2008 gross deferred tax assets were 5517 million and 6088 million respectively and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was 5504 million and 6068 million respectively our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 

  

impairment of longlived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted 

  

cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value when material these gains are recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

  

goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary our methodologies used for valuing goodwill have not changed 

  

we have determined that our product families which are components of our operating segments constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill because they are one level below the operating segment they constitute individual businesses and our segment management regularly reviews the operating results of each product family as of each acquisition date all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date we determined the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using management’s assumptions and forecasts as of the acquisition date 

  

we perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year during the first step of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2007 we determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill for all reporting units was recoverable however during the first step of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined that the carrying value of our goodwill for eight of our product families may not be recoverable after completing the second step of our annual impairment analysis for those eight product families we recognized a total charge of 5445 million of which 1282 million was from our computing and consumer product group and 4163 million from our digital and mixed signal product group 

  

we use the income approach based on estimated future cash flows to perform the goodwill impairment test these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues gross profits operating expenses and industry trends we consider other valuation methods such as the cost approach or market approach less desirable than the income approach to perform the goodwill impairment test because there are no standalone companies that exclusively sell the products that are similar to those sold by our reporting units the material assumptions used for the income approach for 2009 2008 and 2007 were five years of projected net cash flows a discount rate of 112 145 and 140 and a longterm growth rate of 35 30 and 46 we considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analyses 

  

the total fair value of the impaired reporting units in 2008 was 5810 million a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have impacted the fair value of the eight impaired reporting units tested by approximately 477 million a one percentage point change in the longterm growth rate would have impacted the fair value by approximately 319 million a one percent increase in the discount rate or a one percent decrease in the longterm growth rate would have required us to perform further analysis that may have resulted in an impairment charge for one or both of the reporting units with material goodwill balances that were at risk as described below 

  

of our nine reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of 2009 there were two with material goodwill balances that were at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test because the fair value of these reporting units as of the date of the last impairment test which was the first day of the fourth quarter of 2009 was not substantially in excess of the carrying value information from our last impairment test for these two reporting units is as follows 

  

   

factors we consider important that could trigger a subsequent impairment review and possible impairment loss for these two reporting units include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues andor increased costs we may have further material goodwill impairments 

  

the fair value of the remaining seven reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the date of the last impairment test 

  

our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed in our fourth quarter of 2010 however further declines in operating results and in our business outlook primarily due to the current macroeconomic environment may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods 

  

defined benefit plans we maintain pension plans covering certain of our foreign employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees all of these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans for example as of december 31 2009 a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately 85 million 

  

valuation of stock compensation  the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a latticebased option valuation model the lattice model uses 1 a constant volatility 2 an employee exercise behavior model based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior and 3 the treasury yield curve to calculate the fair value of shares issued for each option grant we continue to use the blackscholes optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of shares issued under the 2000 employee stock purchase plan 

  

contingencies we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 166 “accounting for transfers of financial assets—an amendment of fasb statement no 140” “sfas no 166” which is included in asc 860 transfers and servicing “asc 860” it eliminates the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity creates more stringent conditions for reporting transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale clarifies other saleaccounting criteria and changes the initial measurement of a transferor’s interest in transferred financial assets this pronouncement is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november 15 2009 we are currently assessing the potential impacts if any on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 167 “amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r” “sfas no 167” which is included in asc 810 it eliminates interpretation 46r’s exceptions to consolidating qualifying specialpurpose entities contains new criteria for determining the primary beneficiary and increases the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity the pronouncement also contains a new requirement that any term transaction or arrangement that does not have a substantive effect on an entity’s status as a variable interest entity a company’s power over a variable interest entity or a company’s obligation to absorb losses or its right to receive benefits of an entity must be disregarded in applying interpretation 46r’s provisions the elimination of the qualifying specialpurpose entity concept and its consolidation exceptions means more entities will be subject to consolidation assessments and reassessments the pronouncement is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november 15 2009 we are currently assessing the potential impacts if any on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2010 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201006 “fair value measurements and disclosures topic 820 improving disclosures about fair value measurements” “asu 201006” which amends the disclosure guidance with respect to fair value measurements specifically the new guidance requires disclosure of amounts transferred in and out of levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements a reconciliation presented on a gross basis rather than a net basis of activity in level 3 fair value measurements greater disaggregation of the assets and liabilities for which fair value measurements are presented and more robust disclosure of the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure level 2 and 3 fair value measurements asu 201006 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2009 with the exception of the new guidance around the level 3 activity reconciliations which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 we are currently evaluating the impacts if any on our consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

  

at december 31 2009 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 9335 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 6472 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 2863 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately 14 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase 

  

one of our foreign exchange hedging agreement has a provision for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving facility is less than 25 million 

  

a majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however as a multinational business we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce 

  

our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments this strategy reduces but does not eliminate the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements for example changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting  there have been no other changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2009 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control — integrated framework  we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2009 

  

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” of this report

on december 31 2007 we purchased from analog devices inc and its subsidiaries “adi” certain assets including property plant and equipment and intellectual property rights related to adi’s voltage regulation and thermal monitoring products for its computing applications business “ptc business” as part of the purchase we offered employment to substantially all of adi’s employees involved in the ptc business we also entered into several ancillary agreements including a licensing agreement a oneyear manufacturing supply agreement with adi as the supplier a transition services agreement and an escrow agreement covering certain postclosing indemnification obligations of adi the total acquisition cost of 1480 million of cash included 1470 million 

  

paid to adi for the ptc business and approximately 10 million in legal accounting and appraisal fees related to the transaction in addition the company entered into a 369 million supply agreement for inventory as a result of the acquisition we have benefited from the technical expertise customer relationships and power management knowhow of the ptc business and its employees this acquisition expands our overall computing power management business and increased our notebook power management marketshare see note 5 “acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion 

  

on march 17 2008 we completed the purchase of amis whereby amis became our whollyowned subsidiary at the effective time of the merger each issued and outstanding share of common stock of amis was converted into 115 shares of our common stock the aggregate purchase price was approximately 9397 million which included common stock restricted stock units “rsus” options and warrants issued and estimated direct transaction costs we believe the combination has enhanced and will enhance shareholder value by 1 accelerating our transformation from a discrete supplier to a key supplier with scale 2 strengthening our endmarket presence facilitating our entry into new markets and deepening customer relationships 3 obtaining significant scale and cash flow generation and 4 achieving cost savings by leveraging our operational excellence and increasing the activity in our gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility see note 5 “acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion 

  

on october 10 2008 we completed the purchase of catalyst semiconductor inc a delaware corporation “catalyst” whereby catalyst became our whollyowned subsidiary at the effective time of the merger each issued and outstanding share of common stock of catalyst was converted into 0706 shares of our common stock the aggregate purchase price was approximately 1217 million which includes common stock rsu’s options and warrants issued and estimated direct transaction costs we believe the combination has enhanced and will enhance shareholder value by 1 accelerating our higher margin analog products for the digital consumer market 2 providing entry into the eeprom business 3 leveraging scale to drive growth in the business and 4 achieving cost savings by leveraging our operational excellence and increasing the activity in our gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility see note 5 “acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion 

  

debt financings and cost savings initiatives 

  

since our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors during 2002 and 2003 we engaged in several debt refinancing transactions which extended a portion of our debt maturities some of the transactions that extended our debt maturities also resulted in an increase in our overall interest expense and others lowered our overall interest expense in connection with these transactions we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things make our financial covenants less restrictive on the whole 

  

since 2003 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt and related interest costs as a result of these measures we reduced our total debt from 13029 million as of december 31 2003 to 11693 million as of december 31 2008 we also reduced our interest expense from 1511 million for the year ended december 31 2003 to 383 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

  

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” note 8 “longterm debt” and note 10 “common stock treasury stock and net income loss per share” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details on these financing activities that led to our reduced debt levels and annual interest expense 

  

although we have production at several locations we have initiated process improvements and selective capital acquisitions that we expect will increase our overall capacity our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on 

  

   

   

   

   

   

products and technology 

  

the following table provides information regarding our primary operating segments 

  

  

   

automotive and power regulation group the explosion in higher performance consumer and computing devices has fueled energy consumption growth which is driving strong demand for highly efficient power supplies needed to charge and run them similarly the proliferation of electronic subsystems in automobiles the value of the electronic content now exceeds that of the metal in many cars has put tremendous stress on the existing 12 volt

custom and foundry products group  we specialize in the design and manufacture of customerspecific and standard semiconductor products for the automotive medical industrial communications and military and aerospace markets applications in these markets require electronic products to interact with the real world through analog signals including light heat pressure power and radio waves these analog signals are captured processed controlled and converted into digital signals using mixedsignal technologies in the products we provide these mixedsignal products combine analog and digital circuitry on a single integrated circuit “ic” to perform various functions ranging from low power signal processing used in medical applications to “smart power” integration necessary for rugged high voltage or high temperature automotive and industrial environments many of these products are customerspecific and are developed in accordance with our customers’ specifications and requirements we work closely with our customers to leverage our design and manufacturing expertise to continually increase the differentiation and competitiveness of their product offerings as a result we have developed strong relationships with our key customers many of whom enjoy industry leading positions in their markets 

  

customers 

  

we have been doing business with 46 of our 50 largest customers for more than five years sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but do not require minimum purchase commitments most of our original equipment manufacturer customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year while our other customers including electronic manufacturer service providers generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of end markets including computing automotive electronics consumer electronics industrial electronics wireless communications networking and military and aerospace sales to customers of 10 or more of revenues were as follows avnet 11 in 2008 avnet 11 in 2007 avnet 11 in 2006 avnet 13 and motorola 10 in 2005 and avnet 12 in 2004 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of i three years from the date of shipment or ii the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog” below 

  

end market for our products 

  

the following table sets forth our principal enduser markets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each enduser market during 2008 sample applications for our products and representative original equipment manufacturer customers and end users 

  

   

   

original equipment manufacturers direct sales to original equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately 49 of our revenues in 2008 39 of our revenues in 2007 and 38 of our revenues in 2006 these customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as motorola delta hewlettpackard samsung siemens apple dell nokia intel and sony and in the automotive industry include continental automotive systems daimlerchrysler delphi trw and visteon we focus on three types of original equipment manufacturers multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core original equipment manufacturer customers the target market customers in the communications power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are original equipment manufacturers that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

  

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 40 of our revenues in 2008 50 of our revenues in 2007 and 48 of our revenues in 2006 our distributors which include arrow avnet ebv elektronik future solomon enterprise and world peace resell to midsized and smaller original equipment manufacturers and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reasonably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 

  

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 11 of our revenues in 2008 10 of our revenues in 2007 and 14 of our revenues in 2006 our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are flextronics jabil and celestica these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many original equipment manufacturers now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace 

  

see part ii item 7 “management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this report for revenues by geographic locations 

  

manufacturing operations 

  

we operate our manufacturing facilities either directly or through a joint venture nine of these facilities are frontend wafer sites located in belgium the czech republic japan malaysia slovakia and the united states and five of such facilities are assembly and test sites located in china malaysia philippines and thailand in addition to these manufacturing and assembly operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 

  

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities the sizes of the locations represent the approximate gross square footage of each site’s building and include among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

  

   

we operate an assembly and test operations facility in leshan china this facility is owned by a joint venture company leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited “leshan” of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is formerly a stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 75  of leshan’s production capacity in 2008 81 in 2007 and 85 in 2006 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 73 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2009 in 2008 we incurred 08 million in underutilization charges in 2007 and 2006 we did not incur any underutilization charges as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan we supply die used in the production process 

  

the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations and we anticipate that any future expansion of our manufacturing capacity would involve this facility in june 2002 we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to 231 million in semiconductor operations which is in addition to the 278 million originally approved in 2004 we committed to make capital contributions of approximately 25 million to this joint venture by 2012 subject to market conditions we have the ability to time these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand 

  

in 2006 we acquired an additional interest in our investment in leshan for 92 million for which the incremental interest in the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets had an estimated fair value of 54 million resulting in 38 million of goodwill 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including ait ase kec magnachip phenitec amkor and psi accounted for approximately 31 22 and 24 of our manufacturing costs in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

raw materials 

  

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a justintime basis and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table showing commitments contingencies and indemnities in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this report from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

sales marketing and distribution 

  

as of december 31 2008 our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 662 professionals operating out of approximately 38 offices which serve customers in 68 countries we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective internetbased applications support from our laboratories in the czech republic china and the united states through online connectivity applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions we continue to monitor our freight and logistical support operations for potential cost savings 

  

patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights 

  

we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor ® and our on logo we own rights to a number of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property directly related to and important to our business in connection with our 1999 recapitalization motorola assigned licensed or sublicensed to us as the case may be certain intellectual property to support and continue the operation of our business as of january 15 2009 we had approximately 928 us and foreign patents and approximately 1072 patent applications pending worldwide our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2009 to 2027 none of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business additionally we have rights to more than 340 registered and common law trademarks our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 

  

as part of the recapitalization motorola assigned to us approximately 295 us patents and patent applications approximately 292 foreign patents and patent applications rights to over 50 trademarks not including the motorola name previously used in connection with our products rights in knowhow relating to at least 39 semiconductor fabrication processes and rights in specified copyrightable materials in addition motorola licensed on a nonexclusive royaltyfree basis other patent trademark copyright and knowhow rights used in connection with our then existing products and products contemplated in our longrange plans we have perpetual royaltyfree worldwide rights under motorola’s patent portfolio and other intellectual property existing as of the date of our recapitalization or created in the five years thereafter the fiveyear period existing only with respect to patents as necessary to manufacture market and sell our then existing and long range plan product lines additionally motorola provided us with a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from certain infringement claims by third parties who had granted motorola licenses as of the date of our recapitalization which assisted us in developing our own patent position and licensing program through these arrangements we have the right to use a significant amount of motorolaowned technology used in connection with the products we currently offer 

  

seasonality 

  

our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related end markets in 2006 and 2007 the pattern was one of a seasonally soft first half of the year with a stronger second half of the year as our products have increasingly become more consumer driven in 2008 this pattern was interrupted by the global recession which affected us throughout the year we are uncertain if the past pattern will return after global economic conditions settle and return to more predictable patterns 

  

backlog 

  

our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders or customer agreements that are predominately booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demands from our electronic data interface customers in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times because we record revenues on a “sellthrough” basis backlog comprised of orders from distributors will not result in revenues until the distributors sell the products ordered during 2008 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 76 and 101 of actual revenues during such quarter as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases customers tend to order products further in advance and as a result backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase we note that due to the macroeconomic environment current capacity utilization in the industry is decreasing as a result customers are not ordering products as far in advance we anticipate that this trend will cause a decrease in backlog at the beginning of such periods 

  

in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 

  

we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for generalpurpose semiconductor products like ours is highly competitive although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products see part i item 1a “risk factors — trends risks and uncertainties related to our business” located elsewhere in this report 

  

below we discuss the effects of competition on our five primary operating segments 

  

automotive and power regulation 

  

the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation technical performance quality service and price our competitive strengths in this group are our strong technology and design resources our industry recognition in applications such as automotive and computing and our market share our significant competitors in this market include fairchild semiconductor infineon national semiconductor st microelectronics and texas instruments several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions a competitive challenge in this group is our small market share with certain japanese automotive customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs if we are not identified as a vendor in the product design phase in most cases it is difficult to convince the manufacturer of the product to substitute our components during the production phase 

  

computing products 

  

the principal methods of competition in this group are technical performance total cost of solution ownership quality and assurance of supply our architecture for our microprocessor and ddr memory controllers offers a competitive costofownership and performance position to compete with incumbent suppliers in addition the breadth of our portfolio in other support functions dcdc converters over voltage protection fets and analog give us the opportunity to serve multiple requirements and allow customers to control their vendor lists more easily our significant competitors in this market include intersil international rectifier fairchild semiconductor and infineon several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 

  

digital and consumer products 

  

the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation especially in packaging technical performance price quality and assurance of supply our competitive strengths in this group are our ability to put rf and emi filters and fets products in ever smaller packages without significantly degrading performance our significant competitors in this market include national semiconductor maxim fairchild semiconductor infineon international rectifier philips st microelectronics and vishay several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 

  

standard products 

  

our competitive strength in this area is the breadth of our portfolio our low cost structure high quality and our supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation and constantly introducing new packages and performance improvements on existing products of particular importance are our over voltage protection portfolios esd protection tvs zeners and our clock management and distribution portfolios where we enjoy significant performance advantages over our competition our significant competitors in this market include fairchild semiconductor diodes nxp international rectifier vishay micrel idtics st microelectronics texas instruments and semtech 

  

custom and foundry products group 

  

our competitive strengths in this area which add value to our customers include our unique process technologies our ability to design complex highly integrated products our commitment to quality and our commitment to support our customers’ products throughout their product lives our significant competitors in this market include stmicroelectronics texas instuments maxim microchip linear technology atmel and ibm 

  

research and development 

  

companysponsored research and development costs in 2008 2007 and 2006 were 2339 million 114 of revenue 1330 million 85 of revenue and 1012 million 66 of revenues respectively our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications during 2008 research and development costs increased due to increased expenses associated with ongoing research and development activities as a result of the acquisitions of amis the ptc business from adi and catalyst the development of new process technologies in our gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility combined with the effects of foreign currency on wages 

  

government regulation 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 

  

our manufacturing facility in phoenix arizona is located on property that is a “superfund” site a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to cleanup activities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of onsite solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and offsite contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter the remaining unused property and buildings are currently being marketed for sale or lease 

  

manufacturing facilities in slovakia and the czech republic have ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that these facilities were operated by governmentowned entities in each matter these remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located onsite and offsite with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded at each of the respective locations the governments of the czech republic and slovakia have agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries subject to specified limitations for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination based upon the information available we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 

  

our design center in east greenwich rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination when we purchased the east greenwich facility we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property based on the information available we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

  

as a result of the acquisition of amis we are a “primary responsible party” to an environmental remediation and cleanup at amis’s former corporate headquarters in santa clara california costs incurred by amis include implementation of the cleanup plan operations and maintenance of remediation systems and other project management costs however amis’s former parent company a subsidiary of nippon mining contractually agreed to indemnify amis and us for any obligation relating to environmental remediation and cleanup at this location in accordance with statement of position sop no 961 “environmental remediation liabilities” we have not offset the receivable from nippon mining’s subsidiary against the estimated liability on the consolidated balance sheets therefore a receivable from nippon mining’s subsidiary is recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2008 related to this matter we do not believe that the liability and receivable amounts are material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

  

if deterioration of the economy continues this could cause additional financial and operational declines which could lead to unanticipated reductions in our earnings and could result in future goodwill impairments 

  

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 5445 million related to our acquisitions of amis cherry semiconductor corporation “cherry” and the ptc business as of december 31 2008 the remaining total goodwill for the company amounted to 1602 million factors we consider important that could trigger a subsequent impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends if current economic conditions worsen causing decreased revenues andor increased costs we may have further material goodwill impairments 

  

we have experienced declines in revenues and have incurred operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and incur additional operating losses in the future 

  

at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and incurred operating losses although recently we have experienced some strength in our results over the course of the past couple fiscal years reduced enduser demand price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business and we are currently experiencing declines in revenue and incurring operating losses in order to remain profitable we must continue to successfully implement our business plan including our cost reduction initiatives we also currently face an environment of declining revenues uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address we cannot assure you that we will be able to in the future turn our recent operating loss into operating income 

  

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

  

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices in some ways we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience such downturns in the future we can not accurately predict the timing of the current and future downturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these downturns might be future downturns in the semiconductor industry or any failure of the industry to fully recover from downturns could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

current economic conditions including those related to the credit markets may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

  

the united states and global economy is currently undergoing a period of slowdown and unprecedented volatility which some observers view as a recession and the future economic environment may continue to be less favorable for the foreseeable future this slowdown has and could further lead to reduced consumer and commercial spending in the foreseeable future in addition the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions reduced spending may drive us and our competitors to reduce product pricing which would have a negative impact on gross profit a continued softening in the economy may adversely and materially affect our industry business and results of operations and we can not accurately predict how severe and prolonged any downturn might be moreover reduced revenues as a result of a softening of the economy may also reduce our working capital and interfere with our short term and long term strategies 

  

furthermore the united states and global credit markets are currently experiencing an unprecedented contraction as a result of the tightening credit markets we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all if one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails we may not be able to find a replacement which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under our credit facilities in addition if the current pressures on credit continue or worsen we may not be able to refinance if necessary our outstanding debt when due which could have a material adverse effect on our business while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital debt service and capital expenditures for the immediate future if our operating results falter and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate or if interest rates increase significantly we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition the ongoing global financial and economic crisis affecting the financial and other markets could impact our business in a number of other ways including 

  

   

   

   

   

the integration of catalyst and amis into our business could result in adverse events and the anticipated benefits of those mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

  

the integration of these two companies that have previously operated independently with principal offices in two distinct locations requires significant coordination internally and with third parties in response to these mergers our existing or prospective customers may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions as we integrate catalyst and amis into our business or they may seek to change their existing business relationships in addition as a result of the mergers current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us and we could lose key employees as a result in addition to retention these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel the integration of catalyst and amis will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships 

  

we estimate material pretax savings in 2009 may be achieved through the integration of catalyst and amis into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure as with any estimate it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be incorrect moreover even if we were able to integrate both business operations successfully there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time 

  

we may experience difficulties in operating the gresham manufacturing facility including the inability to utilize this additional capacity in a costefficient manner and to successfully develop new products which can be manufactured in this facility 

  

on may 15 2006 we acquired the gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility and hired substantially all of the manufacturing and engineering employees working at the gresham facility our ability to achieve the benefits we anticipated from the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility depend in large part upon whether we are able to operate this facility in an efficient and costeffective manner if we are unable to operate this facility successfully we may be unable to realize the cost savings revenue growth gross margin improvement earnings growth and other anticipated benefits we expected to achieve as a result of the acquisition and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

in connection with the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility we entered into a supply contract with lsi the previous owner of the facility which is due to expire on may 14 2012 at the end of the second quarter of 2009 lsi will no longer have any obligation to purchase a minimum commitment under this supply contract and their purchases may decrease significantly thereafter our ability to generate operating profits in the gresham manufacturing facility will likely depend upon our successful development of new products that can be produced using the technology of the gresham manufacturing facility as well as our ability to transfer existing products to the gresham manufacturing facility failure to successfully develop or integrate new products into the gresham manufacturing facility or to successfully market those new products could result in a loss of market share in the industry or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and ultimately could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 

  

our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization 

  

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits as a percentage of total revenues gross profit was 363 for 2008 compared to 377 for 2007 and 385 for 2006 gross profit declined in 2008 primarily due to the sale of inventory that was written up to fair value in connection with the acquisitions of adi amis and catalyst as well as the decrease in average selling prices partially offset by cost reduction activities in 2007 and 2006 the gross profit percentage declined 

  

because the decrease in average selling prices was not fully offset by cost reduction activities increased competition and other factors including current economic factors may lead to price erosion lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

  

the failure to implement as well as the completion and impact of our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 

  

from time to time we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to among other things significant downturns in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead in the past we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments as well as gains on the sale of assets and insurance recoveries on january 31 2008 we announced that we intended to accelerate our standalone cost reduction programs including a continued focus on the consolidation of our manufacturing operations most recently in january 2009 we announced that we were taking additional cost reduction measures in the fourth quarter of 2008 the company began taking initial actions to reduce overall spending levels the actions included the reduction of 2009 planned capital expenditures to 55 to 60 million from normalized yearly levels of approximately 130 to 140 million temporary site shutdowns during the fourth quarter of 2008 a hiring freeze the elimination of second half of 2008 bonus payments and strict controls over all discretionary spending we also planned a series of additional permanent and temporary actions to reduce its overall cost structure these planned actions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the combination of these and other actions we are taking is expected to reduce total fixed costs by approximately 40 to 50 million a quarter of which approximately 10 to 15 million will be from temporary actions these actions are expected to reduce operating expenses by approximately 20 million from the third quarter of 2008 runrates and exclude the operating expense impact associated with the catalyst semiconductor acquisition which closed in the fourth quarter of 2008 once completed these actions are expected to reduce the revenues required for cash breakeven to approximately 340 million a quarter to execute these cost reduction actions we anticipate we will use approximately 20 to 30 million of cash over the next 5 quarters and incur restructuring and other charges a portion of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 

  

we cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will be successfully implemented or will sufficiently help in returning to profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable and unintended factors or consequences that could adversely impact our profitability and business including unintended employee attrition 

  

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

  

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 continue to aggressively manage maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 further expand our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 rationalize our manufacturing operations 7 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 8 reduce selling and administrative expenses 9 manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands 10 actively manage working capital 11 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 12 focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

  

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other things to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

  

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

  

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 

  

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

  

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty we routinely purchase inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

  

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

  

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for semiconductor components is highly competitive as a result of the recent economic downturn competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

  

the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness many of our competitors particularly larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

  

because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 

  

we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends 

  

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

  

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

  

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other things capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

  

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing and information technology and equipment to remain competitive the failure inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

  

semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices we maintain certain of our own manufacturing assembly and test facilities which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 

  

we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency any such implementation however can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or in some instances to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned in the case of abandonment we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

  

on january 7 2009 in connection with several cost reduction measures we announced the reduction of 2009 planned capital expenditures to 55 to 60 million from normalized yearly levels of approximately 130 to 140 million this reduction may affect our ability to remain competitive or maintain efficiency and productivity ultimately we may be forced to increase our future capital expenditures to meet our operational needs in among other areas manufacturing information technology and equipment we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in the areas discussed above or other areas we have not identified 

  

if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

  

product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

  

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including polysilicon silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw 

  

materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

in addition for some of our products we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 

  

we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses incurring additional debt assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 

  

in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts among other concerns successful acquisitions and alliances are subject to the following risks and uncertainties 1 the difficulty of integrating aligning and coordinating organization which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures 2 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions 3 the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets 4 the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 5 the risk of diverting the attention of senior management and other key employees from our daytoday operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts 6 the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience 7 risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems 8 difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses and 9 future impairments of goodwill of an acquired business in addition key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of changeincontrol agreements acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equitybased compensation rights 

  

in addition we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results 

  

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

  

a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the americas the asiapacific region and europe including the middle east respectively similarly we maintain significant operations in these regions in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

  

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and financial personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive for example analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components in addition in january 2009 we announced certain cost reductions that included the freezing of salaries and elimination of bonuses mandatory unpaid time off factory shutdowns and reduction in personnel all of the measures could negatively affect morale and lead to unintended employee attrition at all levels of our organization moreover we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel as employee incentives we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time we have also issued restricted stock units with timebased vesting and performance based awards our stock price at times has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of certain of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

  

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty patents or other intellectual property rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

  

we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 

  

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

  

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged intellectual property rights 

  

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

  

all industries including the semiconductor industry are subject to legal claims with and without merit including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general we are involved in a variety of legal matters most of which we consider routine matters that arise in the normal course of business these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers employment and labor and intellectual property we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however defense and settlement costs can be substantial even with respect to claims that have no merit due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

as mentioned above from time to time we have been or may in the future be involved in securities litigation we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any securities litigation matter in which we are party these types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for more information on our legal proceedings including our pending securities class action litigation 

  

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

  

like most publiclytraded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public 

  

accounting firm we have not been able to ascertain the impact that the integrations of amis and catalyst will have in the future on our ability to maintain internal control over financial reporting amis reported in its quarterly report on form 10q for the fiscal quarter ended september 29 2007 that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of september 29 2007 as a result of a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting see amis’s quarterly report on form 10q for the fiscal quarter ended september 29 2007 for more information on this material weakness we have not assessed the impact that amis’s material weakness will have on our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting and will not be able to adequately do so until after the integration is completed which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2009 additionally we have not assessed the impact that catalyst will have on our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting and will not be able to adequately to do so until the second half of 2009 there can be no assurance that our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal control over financial reporting in the future if internal controls over financial reporting are materially deficient we may experience a loss of public confidence which could have a material adverse effect on its business and stock price 

  

see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 

  

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other things regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 

  

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

  

   

   

   

   

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in particular through our new amis subsidiary we are subject to warranty and 

  

product liability claims relating to the medical market that are disproportional to the revenue we receive from our customers who incorporate our products into their goods or products in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

  

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

  

we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations in addition we may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

  

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness currently limit us along with our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next 12 months if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities moreover some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness ultimately we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all and we may need to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 

  

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

  

our debt agreements contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

  

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

  

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on 

  

acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

  

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had a significant variance and we can not accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

  

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

we have no unresolved staff comments which would require disclosure under this item 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

in the united states our corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing design center and research and development operations are located in approximately 126 million square feet of building space on property that we own in phoenix arizona we also lease properties around the world for use as sales offices design centers research and development labs warehouses logistic centers trading offices and manufacturing support the size andor location of these properties change from time to time based on business requirements we operate distribution centers which are leased or contracted through a third party in locations throughout asia europe and the americas we own our manufacturing facilities in the united states japan malaysia the philippines slovakia the czech republic thailand and belgium these facilities are primarily manufacturing operations but also include office utility laboratory warehouse and unused space additionally we own a research and development facilities located in romania and canada our joint venture in leshan china also owns manufacturing warehouse laboratory office and unused space 

  

in december 2003 we announced our decision to phase out manufacturing operations at our facility in east greenwich rhode island we completed this closure during the fourth quarter of 2005 we transferred the production from this facility to our lower cost manufacturing facilities we completed the sale of the manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of 2006 we still own and occupy an approximately 58000 square foot design center in east greenwich rhode island 

  

in the second quarter of 2006 we purchased an approximately 500000 square foot manufacturing facility in gresham oregon this site is 83 acres and includes 98000 square feet of clean room 

  

as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola conveyed to us the surface rights to a portion of the land located at our phoenix facility excluding the subsurface rights and conveyed buildings located at the phoenix facility these buildings do not include any treatment facilities relating to motorola’s environmental cleanup operations at the phoenix facility we executed a declaration of covenants easements and restrictions with motorola providing access easements for the parties and granting us options to purchase or to lease the subsurface rights of the land in 2005 we announced plans to sell unused portions of the phoenix arizona location in october 2006 we sold a portion of the phoenix arizona site that included an unused warehouse and unused parking lot the remaining unused property and buildings are currently being marketed for sale or lease we will continue to use the phoenix facility as our corporate headquarters as previously announced on our form 8ks filed with the sec on january 9 2009 and on february 4 2009 as one of the cost reduction measures we will be closing our remaining phoenix wafer fabrication facility and transferring production to other sites within the company’s infrastructure 

  

we believe that our facilities around the world whether owned or leased are well maintained we believe that we have sufficient access to productive capacity to meet our needs for the majority of the products in our business lines for the foreseeable future 

  

we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and similar assets of each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries but no more than 65 of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries held by them to secure our senior bank facilities 

  

see part i item 1 “manufacturing operations” included elsewhere in this report for further details on our properties 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on information currently available management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters including the matters described or referred to in the next paragraphs will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  

securities class action litigation 

  

during the period july 5 2001 through july 27 2001 we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our former officers current and former directors and the underwriters for our initial public offering the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york as abrams v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6114 breuer v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6287 and cohen v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6942 “district court” on april 19 2002 the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint alleges among other things that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters’ excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately 300 other publiclytraded 

  

companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city which have all been transferred along with the case against us to a single federal district court judge for purposes of coordinated case management we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended and intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously the litigation process is inherently uncertain however and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us 

  

on july 15 2002 together with the other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them in addition the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual former officers and current and former directors who were named as defendants in our litigation and they are no longer parties to the litigation on february 19 2003 the district court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants in that ruling the district court granted in part and denied in part those motions as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws the district court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to replead these claims as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded the district court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well the district court also denied the underwriter defendants’ motion to dismiss in all respects 

  

in june 2003 upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation had it been approved by the district court this proposed settlement would have resulted in the dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elected to participate in the proposed settlement together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants this proposed issuer settlement was conditioned on among other things a ruling by the district court that the claims against us and against the other issuers who had agreed to the settlement would be certified for class action treatment for purposes of the proposed settlement such that all investors included in the proposed classes in these cases would be bound by the terms of the settlement unless an investor opted to be excluded from the settlement in a timely and appropriate fashion 

  

on december 5 2006 the us court of appeals for the second circuit “court of appeals” issued a decision in in re initial public offering securities litigation that six purported class action lawsuits containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted against us could not be certified as class actions due in part to the court of appeals’ determination that individual issues of reliance and knowledge would predominate over issues common to the proposed classes on january 8 2007 the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking rehearing en banc of this ruling on april 6 2007 the court of appeals denied the plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing of the court of appeals’ december 5 2006 ruling the court of appeals however noted that the plaintiffs remained free to ask the district court to certify classes different from the ones originally proposed which might meet the standards for class certification that the court of appeals articulated in its december 5 2006 decision in light of the court of appeals’ december 5 2006 decision regarding certification of the plaintiffs’ claims the district court entered an order on june 25 2007 terminating the proposed settlement between the plaintiffs and the issuers including us 

  

on august 14 2007 the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in the six focus cases the issuer defendants and the underwriter defendants separately moved to dismiss the claims against them in the amended complaints in the six focus cases on march 26 2008 the district court issued an order in which it denied in substantial part the motions to dismiss the amended complaints in the six focus cases 

  

in february 2009 an agreementinprinciple to settle the litigation in its entirety was reached which agreement will be subject to negotiation filing with the district court of definitive settlement documents and final approval by the district court while we can make no assurances or guarantees as to the outcome of these 

  

proceedings we believe that the final result of this action will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

intellectual property matters 

  

we face risk to exposure from claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others in the ordinary course of business we receive letters asserting that our products or components breach another party’s rights these threats may seek that we make royalty payments that we stop use of such rights or other remedies we were in binding arbitration on one such claim under an existing license agreement the arbitration hearing occurred late last year and the panel issued an interim reasoned award on march 20 2008 containing a final decision and ruling that none of our accused products infringed the asserted patent per the terms of the license agreement this decision is binding and nonappealable however on april 10 2008 the other party filed a motion with the panel to reconsider its decision on the merits which we opposed as being impermissible and procedurally improper on may 1 2008 the panel issued its decision and order denying the other party’s motion to reconsider the interim reasoned award on may 19 2008 we filed a motion to recover our costs arbitrators’ fees and attorneys’ fees on july 11 2008 the panel issued a decision in our favor and ordered the other party to pay us substantially all of our costs and fees on june 20 2008 the other party filed petitions to vacate in part the panel’s interim reasoned award one petition was filed in arizona state court and the other petition was filed in arizona federal district court on august 15 2008 we filed a counterpetition in state court to confirm the panel’s july 11 2008 ruling on august 29 2008 the other party filed an amended petition in state court to stay all proceedings there pending the federal court’s decision on jurisdiction which petition was subsequently granted on october 16 2008 we believe both petitions filed by the other party are without merit on january 30 2009 we entered into a settlement agreement with the other party who agreed to pay us the costs and fees awarded by the panel the parties filed stipulations to dismiss in both the state and federal courts which stipulations to dismiss were granted with prejudice by the state court on february 4 2009 and by the federal court on february 5 2009 bringing this matter to a close 

  

on april 18 2008 lsi logic corporation “lsi” and agere systems inc “agere” which was acquired by lsi in 2007 filed a new patent infringement action with the us international trade commission “itc” naming 18 semiconductor companies including us lsi and agere also filed a parallel patent infringement lawsuit against the same companies in the federal district court in the eastern district of texas lsi and agere are seeking an injunction and damages in an unspecified amount relating to such alleged infringement the patent relates to semiconductor wafer processing we believe that we are already licensed to the asserted patent through preexisting patent license agreements with lsi and agere and that these licenses cover all of our relevant wafer operations lsi and agere have agreed with our assertion that we are already licensed and we are completing discussions on a settlement agreement which would dismiss us from both the itc action and the lawsuit 

  

prior to the acquisition of amis by us on march 17 2008 on july 19 2007 amis was served with an amended complaint filed against its operating company ami semiconductor inc and its belgian subsidiary ami semiconductor belgium bvba by powerdsine inc and powerdsine ltd subsidiaries of microsemi corporation “powerdsine” in the united states district court for the southern district of new york related to amis’s recently announced poweroverethernet “poe” power sourcing equipment “pse” application specific integrated circuit products customdesigned for broadcom corporation the complaint alleged that amis breached the terms of a nondisclosure agreement between the parties and that amis interfered with a powerdsine ltd employment contract with a former employee who left powerdsine and came to work for amis this second claim was later dismissed by powerdsine on august 10 2007 in the complaint powerdsine seeks injunctive relief and damages in excess of 150 million amis has denied powerdsine’s claims and has filed counterclaims against powerdsine and microsemi for defamation in december 2008 the district court held on summary judgment that powerdsine and microsemi’s statements did not constitute defamation under california state law where the statements by microsemi were made also in december 2008 the parties participated in a mandatory mediation with a federal magistrate judge for the southern district of new york but 

  

arrived at no settlement discovery in the case is complete and the trial began in new york on february 2 2009 and was scheduled to be completed by february 13 2009 on february 10 2009 the district court judge suspended trial until march 23 2009 to allow for further mediation in an effort to resolve the dispute we believe that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow 

  

prior to the acquisition of amis by us on march 17 2008 in january 2003 ricoh company ltd “ricoh” filed in the us district court for the district of delaware a complaint against amis and other parties alleging infringement of a patent owned by ricoh the case has been transferred to the us district court for the northern district of california ricoh is seeking an injunction and damages in an unspecified amount relating to such alleged infringement the patents relate to certain methodologies for the automated design of custom semiconductors the case was scheduled to go to trial in march 2007 however in december 2006 the court issued an order staying the case pending a reexamination proceeding filed by synopsys inc “synopsys” before the us patent  trademark office “pto” challenging the validity of the patent claims at issue in this case since that time synopsis has filed a total of three reexamination petitions with the pto challenging the validity of the claims at issue the pto granted all three petitions and consolidated all three reexaminations into one proceeding before a single examiner in april 2008 the court lifted the stay despite the ongoing reexamination proceedings in the pto which proceedings were subsequently completed in september 2008 and the pto issued a final rejection of all claims in the asserted patent over prior art ricoh has filed a notice of appeal with pto and has until february 24 2009 to file its appeal brief additionally in september 2008 the court granted defendants request to refile its summary judgment motion on noninfringement that had been vacated as moot when the stay was imposed in december 2006 a hearing on defendants’ motion for summary judgment was scheduled for january 30 2009 but was cancelled by the judge who instead told both parties that he would issue his order without holding a hearing we are currently awaiting the judge’s order we believe that the asserted claims are without merit and even if meritorious that we will be indemnified against damages by synopsys and that resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations financial condition or cash flows

industry overview 

  

worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 2619 billion in 2008 an increase of 25 from 2556 billion in 2007 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market since 2004 

  

  

    

following the unprecedented semiconductor industry revenue declines of 2001 the semiconductor industry began to show signs of stability in 2002 and grew more robust in both 2003 and 2004 worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by 89 in 2006 32 in 2007 and 25 in 2008 sales in our total addressable market grew by 142 in 2004 reflecting increases in volume and slowing rates of price declines sales in our total addressable market remained stable in 2005 reflecting increases in volume that were offset by price declines sales in our total addressable market grew in 2006 reflecting increases in volume that exceeded the impact of further price declines sales in our total addressable market grew in 2007 reflecting increases in volume that exceeded the impact of further pure declines sales in our total addressable market grew significantly in 2008 reflecting the expanded markets we now serve with the acquisitions of amis and catalyst that exceeded the impact of any pure declines the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately 37 during 2009 through 2011 these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results 

  

recent results 

  

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 were 20548 million an increase of 312 percent from 15662 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the majority of which was due to our acquisition of amis in the first quarter of 2008 during 2008 we reported a net loss of 3801 million that included a goodwill impairment charge of 5445 million during 2007 we reported net income of 2422 million that included 30 million in restructuring asset impairments and other benefits our gross margin decreased by approximately 140 

  

basis points to 363 in 2008 from 377 in 2007 the primary reason for the decrease is attributable to the sale of inventory that was written up to fair value in connection with the acquisitions of adi amis and catalyst as well as the decreases in average selling prices partially offset by cost reduction activities in 2008 versus 2007 

  

outlook 

  

based upon product booking trends backlog levels manufacturing services revenues and estimated turns levels we anticipate that total revenues will be approximately 340 million to 380 million in the first quarter of 2009 backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of 2009 were down from backlog levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2008 and represent approximately 80 to 90 percent of our anticipated first quarter 2009 revenues we expect that average selling prices for the first quarter of 2009 will be down approximately 2 from the fourth quarter of 2008 we expect cash capital expenditures of approximately 20 million to 25 million in the first quarter of 2009 and total cash capital expenditures for 2009 of approximately 55 million to 60 million 

  

for the first quarter of 2009 we expect gross profit as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 29 to 31 for the first quarter of 2009 we also expect total operating expenses of approximately 146 million to 148 million which include the amortization of intangible assets stock compensation expense restructuring asset impairments and other charges of approximately 31 million to 33 million 

  

we anticipate that net interest expense and other expenses will be approximately 21 million for the first quarter of 2009 which includes noncash interest expense of approximately 9 million from the adoption of fasb apb 141 relating to our convertible senior subordinated notes we expect cash payments of income taxes to be approximately 3 million we also expect stock compensation expense of approximately 12 million to 13 million in the first quarter of 2009 our current fully diluted share count is approximately 413 million shares based on recent share prices 

  

business overview 

  

we classify our products broadly as power analog digital signal processing mixedsignal advanced logic memory data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components we design manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products our power management semiconductor components control convert protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our custom application specific integrated circuits use analog digital signal processing mixedsignal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive medical military aerospace consumer and industrial customers’ unique products our data management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all electronic devices these various products fall into the logic analog and discrete categories used by wsts 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand have reached levels above capacity production capabilities shortages have begun to occur which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

  

during 2008 we experienced an increase in revenues over 2007 resulting from the acquisitions of amis and catalyst net of price decreases we expect price declines during 2009 to be moderate but macroeconomic and competitive factors can quickly change the pricing landscape 

  

new product innovation 

  

as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives excluding the introduction of leadfree products we introduced 241 new product families in 2008 of which 73 were generated from the acquisitions of amis and catalyst and 168 were generated from our existing business operations there were 171 new product families in 2007 our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications with the acquisition of the gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility we increased our research and development in deep sub micron power management solutions to further differentiate us from our competition as always it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position us for continued growth as a result we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity logic analog memory and discrete products we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 

  

cost savings and restructuring activities 

  

we continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and as a result we expect to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure 

  

during the first quarter of 2007 we announced plans to consolidate manufacturing efforts with the closing of one of our manufacturing facilities at our phoenix arizona location the wafer manufacturing that took place at this facility has been transferred to our offshore lowcost manufacturing facilities we have exited this facility although we still own it and have leased it to another company for a period of seven years beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 all 80 employees associated with this facility have been terminated also in connection with this activity during the third quarter of 2007 we announced reductions in factory support functions at our phoenix arizona and gresham oregon locations which resulted in the elimination or transfer of 62 positions the full cost savings from these actions is reflected in our outlook for the first quarter of 2009 

  

during the second quarter of 2008 we began the process of closing our wafer fabrication facilities in piestany slovakia which will result in the elimination of approximately 430 positions we expect full annual savings from this announcement to be approximately 120 million to 160 million annually beginning in the second quarter of 2009 

  

during the first quarter of 2009 in response to the economic downturn we announced the following actions to reduce overall spending levels 

  

   

   

   

   

the actions we announced during the first quarter of 2009 are expected to reduce total fixed costs by approximately 40 million to 50 million a quarter of which 10 million to 15 million will be from temporary 

  

actions these actions are expected to reduce operating expenses by approximately 200 million the company expects initial benefits from these actions to start in the first quarter of 2009 and to increase throughout the year the initial benefits have been included in our outlook for the first quarter of 2009 

  

our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on 

  

   

   

   

   

   

debt reduction and financing activities 

  

since the recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors during 2002 and 2003 we engaged in several debt refinancing transactions which extended a portion of our debt maturities since 2003 however we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt and related interest costs as a result of these measures we reduced our total debt from 13029 million as of december 31 2003 to 11693 million as of december 31 2008 similarly we have reduced our annual interest expense from 1511 million in 2003 to 383 million in 2008 also see “liquidity and capital resources” and note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the amounts in the following table are in millions 

  

   

revenues 

  

net revenues were 20548 million 15662 million and 15318 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase from 2007 to 2008 was due to revenues from our october 2008 acquisition of catalyst our march 2008 acquisition of amis of approximately 4670 million combined with a full year of revenues from our december 2007 acquisition of the ptc business from adi combined with an increase in volume and mix of approximately 60 partially offset by a reduction in average selling prices of approximately 50 the nonacquisition related increase from 2006 to 2007 was due to increased product volume and mix of approximately 80 partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 60 the revenues by reportable segment in each of these three years were as follows dollars in millions 

  

   

revenues from automotive and power regulation declined from 2007 to 2008 and increased from 2006 to 2007 in 2008 this decline can be attributed to a decrease in revenues from dc to dc conversion of 13 analog auto products of 16 and ldo and voltage regulator products of 8 partially offset by increases in rectifier of 4 ac to dc conversion of 8 and auto power of 15 from the prior year in 2007 this increase can be attributed to an increase in revenues from ac to dc conversion of 5 rectifier of 4 analog automotive of 14 auto power of 30 and dc to dc conversion products of 1 partially offset by a decrease in ldo and voltage regulator products of 2 

  

revenues from computing products increased from 2007 to 2008 and from 2006 to 2007 the increase from 2007 to 2008 can be attributed to an increase in revenues from power switching of 264 and signal and interface products of 1 partially offset by decreases from low and medium voltage mosfet of 5 the increase from 2006 to 2007 can be attributed to increased revenues from low and medium voltage mosfet of 3 and power switching products of 12 partially offset by decreases in signal and interface products of 1 

  

revenues from digital and consumer products decreased from 2007 to 2008 and increased from 2006 to 2007 the decrease from 2007 to 2008 can be attributed to decreased revenues from analog switches of 9 and filters of 4 partially offset by increases in revenues from low voltage power products of 7 the increase from 2006 to 2007 can be attributed to increased revenues from filters of 17 and low voltage power products of 15 

  

revenues from standard products decreased from 2007 to 2008 and from 2006 to 2007 this segment consists of many products that are available from numerous competitors in the marketplace and is thus heavily influenced by pricing pressures and general market conditions the decrease in revenues from 2007 to 2008 is primarily attributed to decreases in revenues from high frequency products of 20 standard logic products of 4 zener products of 5 thyristor products of 9 small signal products of 1 and bipolar power products of 3 partially offset by increases in revenues from protection products of 23 the decrease in revenues from 2006 to 2007 is primarily attributed to decreases in revenues from standard logic of 15 high frequency of 12 thyristor of 13 bipolar power of 6 and zener products of 17 partially offset by increases in small signal of 4 and protection products of 11 

  

revenues from the custom foundry product group increased from 2007 to 2008 and decreased from 2006 to 2007 the increase in revenues from 2007 to 2008 is primarily attributed to revenues from the acquisition of the amis business partially offset by a decline in activity pursuant to the lsi wafer supply agreement the decrease from 2006 to 2007 is due to lower volume purchases by lsi under the wafer supply agreement with lsi that began in may 2006 related to our purchase of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility 

  

revenues by geographic area as a percentage of revenues were as follows 

  

   

a majority of our end customers served directly or through distribution channels are manufacturers of electronic devices in recent years there has been a trend toward moving such manufacturing activities to lower cost regions particularly in asia our shift in revenues by geographic area reflects this trend in 2007 but the acquisitions of amis reversed the trend in 2008 

  

one of our customers accounted for 11 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 7455 million 5905 million and 5890 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively as a percentage of revenues our gross profit was 363 377 and 385 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the sale of inventory that was written up to fair market value in connection with the acquisitions of amis and the ptc business from adi which had a 95 impact as well as the decrease in average selling prices of 50 partially offset by cost reduction activities gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to cost reductions from our profitability enhancement programs and increased sales volume substantially offset by decrease of 60 in average selling prices the gross profit by reportable segment in each of these three years were as follows dollars in millions 

  

   

gross profit from automotive and power regulation decreased from 2007 to 2008 the decrease can be attributed to decreased gross profit from dc to dc conversion products of 21 analog automotive products of 15 and ldo and voltage regulator products of 9 partially offset by increases in gross profit from rectifier products of 11 ac to dc conversion products of 5 and auto power products of 40 gross profit from automotive and power regulation decreased from 2006 to 2007 the decrease can be attributed to decreased gross profit from rectifier of 21 and dc to dc conversion of 4 partially offset by increases from ac to dc conversion of 2 auto power of 5 analog automotive of 16 and ldo and voltage regulator products of 2 

  

gross profit from computing products increased from 2007 to 2008 the increase can be attributed to increased gross profit from power switching products of 1301 and signal and interface products of 10 partially offset by decreases in low and medium voltage mosfet products of 17 gross profit from computing products increased from 2006 to 2007 the increase can be attributed to increased gross profit from low and medium voltage mosfet products of 16 partially offset by decreases from power switching products of 72 and signal and interface products of 1 

  

gross profit from digital and consumer products decreased from 2007 to 2008 the decrease can be attributed to decreases in filters of 6 and analog switches of 19 partially offset by increases in low voltage products of 8 gross profit from digital and consumer products increased from 2006 to 2007 the increase can be attributed to increased gross profit from analog switch of 8 filter of 17 and low voltage products of 26 

  

gross profit from standard products decreased from 2007 to 2008 the decrease can be attributed to decreases in high frequency products of 24 small signal products of 11 zener products of 8 and thyristor products of 10 partially offset by increases in gross profit from protection products of 31 bipolar power products of 6 and standard logic products of 3 gross profit from standard products remained relatively flat from 2006 to 2007 increases in protection products of 22 small signal of 6 and zener products of 12 were offset by decreases in standard logic of 30 high frequency of 11 thyristor of 30 and bipolar power products of 10 

  

gross profit from the custom and foundry product group increased from 2007 to 2008 the increase is attributed to gross profit from the acquisition of the amis business partially offset by a 707 million expense related to a step up in the inventory valuation as of the acquisition date and decreases in gross profit pursuant to the lsi wafer supply agreement gross profit from custom and foundry product group decreased from 2006 to 2007 due to the decrease in volume of wafers sold to lsi 

  

certain costs incurred during the manufacturing process are not allocated to the reportable segments the increase in unallocated manufacturing costs from 209 million in 2007 to 437 million in 2008 was due primarily to the write off of inprocess research and development associated with our acquisitions of amis and catalyst of 271 million combined with lower underutilized factory costs the decrease in unallocated manufacturing costs from 312 million in 2006 to 209 million in 2007 was due primarily to lower underutilized factory costs 

  

operating expenses 

  

research and development expenses were 2339 million 1330 million and 1012 million representing 114 85 and 66 of revenues in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase from 2007 to 2008 was primarily attributable to increased expense associated with ongoing research and development activities as a result of the acquisitions of catalyst amis and the ptc business from adi as well as the development of new process technologies in our gresham fabrication facility and the effects of foreign currency on wages the increase from 2006 to 2007 was primarily attributable to increased employee salaries and wages and increased headcount and the costs to develop new products in our gresham wafer fabrication facility and the expansion of our digital production capabilities in our gresham wafer fabrication facility partially offset by decreases in employee performance bonuses 

  

selling and marketing expenses were 1344 million 946 million and 910 million representing 65 60 and 59 of revenues in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase from 2007 to 2008 was primarily attributed to increased selling and marketing activities as a result of the acquisition of amis combined with increased activity at our solution engineering centers in north america and asia combined with the expansion of our sales and marketing presence in china and the effects of foreign currency on wages the increase from 2006 to 2007 was primarily attributed to increased employee salaries and wages and increased stock compensation expense partially offset by a decrease in employee performance bonuses 

  

general and administrative expenses were 1224 million 827 million and 867 million representing 60 53 and 57 of revenues in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase from 2007 to 2008 was attributable to increases in stock compensation expense general and administrative expenses associated with the acquisition of amis and increased costs associated with amis integration activities combined with the effects of foreign currency on wages partially offset by decreased employee performance bonuses the decrease from 2006 to 2007 was attributable to decreases in employee performance bonuses partially offset by increased salaries and wages from higher headcount and legal fees 

  

other operating expenses — restructuring asset impairments and other net 

  

restructuring asset impairments and other charges were 262 million 30 million and 69 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our individual quarterly restructuring charges are summarized below for more information see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

other operating expense — goodwill impairment charges 

  

we monitor the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions by reporting unit annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets our goodwill has been allocated to a total of ten reporting units we performed the annual impairment analysis of goodwill at the reporting unit level as of the first day of the fourth quarter by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value is less than the carrying value the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined that based on current market conditions and a decline in our business outlook primarily due to the macroeconomic environment 5445 million of the carrying amount of our goodwill allocated to six of our reporting units was impaired the goodwill allocated to these six reporting units was primarily from our december 31 2007 acquisition of the ptc business and our march 17 2008 acquisition of amis the remaining four reporting units whose goodwill was not impaired had declines in business outlook although not significant enough to trigger impairment we recognized goodwill impairment charges of 4163 million in the custom and foundry products segment 292 million in the automotive and power regulation segment 59 million in the digital and consumer products segment and 931 million in the computing products segment for a total charge of 5445 million the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill was assigned was estimated using the present value of estimated future cash flows there was no impairment of goodwill for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 

  

operating income 

  

information about operating income from our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2008 december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 are as follows in millions 

  

   

depreciation and amortization expense is included in segment operating income reconciliations of segment information to financial statements follows in millions 

  

   

other unallocated operating expenses increased from 253 million in 2007 to 558 million in 2008 primarily due to increased costs associated with the write off of inprocess research and development associated with our acquisitions of 271 million combined with increased costs to develop new products in our gresham 

  

wafer fabrication facility that impact all reporting segments other unallocated operating expenses increased from 67 million in 2006 to 253 million in 2007 primarily due to increased costs to develop new products in our gresham wafer fabrication facility that impact all reportable segments 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 383 million 388 million and 518 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the decrease in interest expense from 2007 to 2008 was primarily a result of lower london interbank offered rate “libor” in 2008 the decrease in interest expense from 2006 to 2007 was primarily a result of interest savings that resulted from the issuance of our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 in december 2006 with a large portion 1990 million used to reduce our senior bank facilities our weightedaverage interest rate on longterm debt including current maturities was 32 34 and 49 per annum in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources — key financing events” for a description of our refinancing activities 

  

gain loss on debt prepayment and repurchases 

  

gain on debt prepayment totaled 110 million in 2008 during the fourth quarter of 2008 we repurchased 609 million of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 for approximately 494 million the 115 million gain on the repurchase was offset by the writeoff of 05 million of proportionate share of the debt issuance costs associated with the zero coupon convertible notes loss on debt prepayment totaled 01 million and 13 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively during the first quarter of 2007 we incurred a loss on debt prepayment of 01 million resulting from the prepayment of 239 million of our senior bank facilities during the fourth quarter of 2006 we used proceeds from the 4840 million 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 and cash on hand to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities accordingly the 13 million loss on debt prepayment resulted from the writeoff of a portion of debt issuance costs associated with the senior bank facilities see “liquidity and capital resources — key financing events” for a description of our refinancing activities 

  

income tax benefit provision 

  

income tax benefit provision was 94 million 77 million and 09 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

the 2008 benefit included 22 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 54 million of new reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions offset by the reversal of 170 million of previously accrued income taxes for anticipated audit issues due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations 

  

the 2007 provision included 99 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 51 million of new reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions partially offset by the reversal of 73 million of previously accrued income taxes for anticipated audit issues

liquidity and capital resources 

  

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements our offbalance sheet arrangements our sources and uses of cash our debt and debt covenants and our management of cash 

  

cash requirements 

  

commercial commitments contractual obligations and indemnities 

  

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt operating leases pension obligations and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

  

  

     

our longterm debt includes 1719 million under senior bank facilities 1991 million of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 950 million under our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 4840 million under our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 184 million outstanding loans with four japanese banks 432 million outstanding loans with two chinese banks 407 million outstanding loans with three philippine banks 250 million outstanding secured financing with a belgian bank and 920 million of capital lease obligations for purposes of the contractual obligation schedule we have shown the convertible debt maturing upon the first put date see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

our other longterm contractual obligations consist of estimated payments to fund liabilities that have been accrued in our consolidated balance sheet for our foreign pension plans see note 11 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 4587 million at december 31 2008 despite recent revenue reductions we have taken actions to lower the cash break even of the company to 3400 million as such we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months 

  

off balance sheet arrangements 

  

in the normal course of business we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system desk top computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

  

in the normal course of business we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us as required for transactions such as material purchase commitments leases or customs guarantees our senior bank facilities include a 250 million revolving facility letters of credit totaling 11 million were outstanding under the revolving facility at december 31 2008 one of our foreign exchange hedging agreements has a provision for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving facility is less than 25 million a bank guarantee of 48 million was outstanding under a nonreusable commitment credit with a belgian bank as of december 31 2008 the belgian bank that issued the guarantee has the right to create a mortgage on the real property of one of our european subsidiaries in the amount of 30 million but had not done so as of december 31 2008 we also have outstanding bank guarantees and letters of credit outside of our revolving facility and the nonreusable commitment credit totaling 109 million at december 31 2008 

  

we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases letters of credit and bank guarantee arrangements for our operating leases we expect to make cash payments and similarly incur expenses totaling 716 million as payments come due based on historical experience and information currently available we believe we will not be required to make any payments under the standby letters of credit or bank guarantee arrangements 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to intellectual property infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

  

we are a party to various agreements with motorola a former affiliate which were entered into in connection with our separation from motorola pursuant to these agreements we have agreed to indemnify motorola for losses due to for example breach of representations and warranties and covenants damages arising from assumed liabilities or relating to allocated assets and for specified environmental matters our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and payment by us is conditioned on motorola making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract which procedures typically allow us to challenge motorola’s claims 

  

we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors we may agree to provide more favorable indemnity rights to such customers for valid warranty claims 

  

in connection with the acquisitions of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility and adi’s ptc business we entered into various agreements with lsi and adi respectively pursuant to certain of these agreements we agreed to indemnify lsi and adi respectively for certain things limited in the most instances by time andor monetary amounts 

  

we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

  

in addition to the above from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 

  

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows

sources and uses of cash 

  

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments to repurchase our stock and other company securities and to pay debt service including our senior subordinated notes including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand and targeted asset sales additionally as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 

  

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

  

   

   

our ability to service our longterm debt including our senior subordinated notes to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may be beyond our control 

  

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us the united states and global credit markets are currently experiencing an unprecedented contraction as a result of the tightening credit markets we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through december 31 2009 to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

  

operations 

  

our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash and our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities each of these components is discussed herein 

  

ebitda 

  

as discussed in note 8 “longterm debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report our debt covenants require us to stay within certain leverage ratios based on the consolidated earnings net income before interest expense provisions for income taxes depreciation and amortization expense for the last four quarters “consolidated ebitda” as defined under the documents for our senior bank facilities totaled approximately 4851 million for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended december 31 2008 

  

if we were not in compliance with the covenants contained in our senior bank facilities the holders of our senior bank facilities could cause all outstanding amounts as of december 31 2008 which were comprised of 1719 million of our term loans to be due and payable immediately and the 11 million of letters of credit to be fully cash collateralized if we were unable to repay refinance or restructure that indebtedness the holders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any such event of default or declaration of acceleration could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity as of december 31 2008 approximately 8430 million remained outstanding under other debt that may be accelerated based on this covenant 

  

working capital 

  

working capital fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs our working capital including cash was 5012 million at december 31 2008 our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents was 425 million at december 31 2008 and has fluctuated between 692 million and 331 million over the last eight quarterends 

  

the components of our working capital at december 31 2008 and 2007 are set forth below in millions followed by explanations for changes between 2007 and 2008 for cash and cash equivalents and any other changes greater than 5 million 

  

   

the increase of 1841 million in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to 3938 million in cash provided by operating activities 1277 million of cash provided by investing activities which includes 1727 million of cash acquired as part of the amis acquisition and 249 million of cash acquired as part of the catalyst acquisition  partially offset by 3371 million in cash used in financing activities 

  

the increase of 136 million in receivables net is primarily due to receivables from the acquisitions held at year end of 911 million from amis and 87 million from catalyst offset by the decline in accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to decreasing revenues 

  

the increase of 1150 million in inventory is primarily the result of raw materials work in process and finished goods inventory held at year end of 641 million from the acquisition of amis and 278 million from the acquisition of catalyst as well as a reduction in shipments to customers during the last quarter of 2008 due to the downturn in the macroeconomic environment 

  

the decrease of 128 million in other current assets is primarily due to usage of supply agreement prepayment of inventory with adi in connection with our acquisition of the ptc business partially offset by increases from acquisitions of 187 million from amis and 04 million from catalyst held at year end 

  

the increase of 147 million in accounts payable is the result of liabilities assumed from the catalyst acquisition of 59 million and 347 million from the amis acquisition held at year end offset by decreases due to lower inventory builds in the fourth quarter of 2008 

  

the increase of 371 million in accrued expenses is primarily due to liabilities assumed from the amis and catalyst acquisitions of 574 million and 30 million held at year end respectively partially offset by timing of payments 

  

the decrease of 63 million in deferred income on sales to distributors is primarily due to decreases in revenues compared to prior period 

  

the increase of 771 million in current portion of longterm debt was primarily due to obligations under the new philippine belgian and japanese loans maturing chinese loans and additional capital lease obligations see note 8 “longterm debt” for further discussion 

  

longterm assets and liabilities 

  

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets foreign tax receivables and capitalized debt issuance costs 

  

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties capital expenditures were 950 million 1407 million and 1990 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity 

  

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans generally our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions see note 11 “employee benefit plans” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our tax reserves see note 9 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

key financing events 

  

overview 

  

since we became an independent company as a result of our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors our longterm debt includes amounts outstanding under our senior bank facilities which contain covenants with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2008 

  

during the second half of 2003 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt reduce related interest costs and in some cases extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility these measures have continued in 2008 set forth below is a summary of the key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years 

  

february 2006 amendment to senior bank facilities 

  

in february 2006 we refinanced the term loans under our senior bank facilities to reduce the interest rate from libor plus 275 to libor plus 250 the amended and restated credit agreement also provided for a step down provision that would further reduce the interest rate to libor plus 225 if we maintain a specified credit rating and meet a specified leverage ratio test that first applied based on the 2005 results 

  

march 2006 amendment to senior bank facilities 

  

the credit agreement relating to our senior bank facilities included a provision requiring an annual calculation of excess cash flow as defined and the application of a portion of that excess cash flow as a prepayment of loans outstanding under the agreement in march 2006 we obtained an amendment of this provision that required repayment only at the election of the debt holders 

  

april 2006 equity offering 

  

on april 6 2006 we completed a public offering of our common stock registered pursuant to a shelf registration statement originally filed with the sec on january 2 2004 in connection with this offering we issued approximately 112 million shares which includes 07 million shares issued to cover overallotments at a price of 700 per share the net proceeds from this offering received by us were 761 million after deducting the underwriting discount of 16 million 014 per share and offering expenses of 04 million the net proceeds were primarily used to partially fund the purchase of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility during the second quarter of 2006 which had a total purchase price of 1050 million 

  

july 2006 exchange offer for zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 

  

on april 6 2004 we commenced a cash tender offer for all of our then outstanding 12 senior subordinated notes due 2009 in order to finance the cash tender offer we issued 2600 million of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 we received net proceeds of approximately 2512 million from the sale of the notes after deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses of 88 million which were capitalized as debt issuance costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method through the first put date of april 15 2010 the notes do not bear cash interest nor does the principal amount accrete the effective interest rate of the notes resulting from the amortization of debt issuance costs is 058 the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries 

  

in june 2006 we commenced an offer to exchange all of our then outstanding 2600 million principal amount of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 the “old notes” for a like principal amount of the “new notes” plus an exchange fee of 250 per 1000 principal amount of their old notes validly tendered and accepted for exchange the new notes contain a net share settlement feature which reduce the amount of shares included in diluted net income per share on july 21 2006 we issued 2595 million aggregate principal amount of new notes that are convertible into cash up to the par value at a conversion rate of 1018849 shares per 1000 principal under certain circumstances the excess of fair value over par value is convertible into stock the exchange expired on july 19 2006 and 998 of the aggregate principal amount of the old notes were tendered and subsequently exchanged on august 9 2006 we entered into transactions with four of the remaining holders of the old notes and exchanged 443000 aggregate principal amount of old notes that were not tendered in the exchange these holders exchanged their old notes for new notes on the same terms as the exchange offer discussed above we intend to repurchase or redeem all of the old notes that remain outstanding subject to market conditions 

  

the new notes are convertible by holders into cash and shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 1018849 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes subject to adjustment in certain events which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 9815 per share of common stock we will settle conversion of all notes validly tendered for conversion in cash and shares of our common stock if applicable subject to our right to pay the share amount in additional cash holders may convert their notes under the following circumstances i during the five businessday period immediately following any five consecutive tradingday period in which the trading price per 1000 principal amount of notes for each day of such period was less than 98 of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate ii upon occurrence of the specified transactions described in the indenture relating to the notes or iii after april 15 2010 we determined that the conversion option based on a trading price condition meets the definition of a derivative and should be bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for separately however the fair value of this feature was determined to be de minimis at the date of issuance and we continue to evaluate the significance of this feature on a quarterly basis 

  

the notes will mature on april 15 2024 beginning april 15 2010 we may redeem the notes in whole or in part for cash at a price of 100 of the principal amount if a holder elects to convert its notes in connection with the occurrence of specified fundamental changes that occurs prior to april 15 2010 the holder will be entitled to receive in addition to cash and shares of common stock equal to the conversion rate an additional 

  

number of shares of common stock in each case as described in the indenture notwithstanding these conversion rate adjustments these notes contain an explicit limit on the number of shares issuable upon conversion holders may require us to repurchase the notes for cash on april 15 of 2010 2014 and 2019 at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of such notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events each holder may require us to purchase all or a portion of such holder’s notes for cash at a price equal to the principal amount of such notes 

  

the notes which are unsecured obligations will be subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated obligations the notes will also be effectively subordinated to any of our or our subsidiaries’ secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 

  

in november of 2008 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of our convertible notes subject to certain conditions we repurchased 609 million of aggregate principal of our zero coupon senior subordinated notes due 2024 for 494 million the 115 million gain was the result of the repurchase of zero coupon senior subordinated notes due 2024 and was offset by the writeoff of 05 million of the proportionate share of the remaining capitalized closing costs related to the zero coupon senior subordinated notes due 2024 resulting in a net gain on debt repurchase of 110 million the average asking price of the notes repurchased was approximately 81 of the coupon

we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and similar assets of each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries but no more than 65 of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries held by them to secure our senior bank facilities

we recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense we recognized approximately 41 million and 27 million in interest expense income and penalties for the years december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively additionally upon acquisition of amis and catalyst the balance of accrued interest and penalties increased by 12 million we had approximately 39 million and 68 million for the payment of interest and penalties accrued at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america note 3 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contains a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue although to a much lesser extent from manufacturing services provided to customers distributor revenue is recognized in various ways within the industry some recognize revenue upon sale to the distributor while others like us recognize the revenue when the sale is made to the end customer additionally there can often be a lag in the data collection from distributors which makes the calculation of revenue recognition challenging due to our high distributor sales revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers and sales of manufacturing services net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that they have resold the products to the end user inaccuracies in the sales or inventory data provided to us by our distributors can therefore result in inaccuracy in our reporting revenues as a result of our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors we defer the related revenue and margin on sales to distributors although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

  

taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including value added and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 

  

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under our general agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized and are netted against revenues given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products our actual returns and allowances and warranty claims have not traditionally fluctuated significantly from period to period and our returns and allowances and warranty provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of i three years from the date of shipment or ii the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge at the time revenue is recognized we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales recorded as a component of cost of revenues in addition we also 

  

offer cash discounts to customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time generally 10 days after shipment we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues based on experience with each customer 

  

freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense during the period in which they are incurred 

  

inventories  we carry our inventories not related to an acquisition at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material except for the sale of obsolete leaded parts during the first quarter of 2007 for approximately 40 million upon the acquisition of a company such as amis catalyst and the adi ptc business we used management estimates to determine the fair value of the inventory as of the acquisition date the methodology involves stepping up the value of acquired finished goods and workinprocess to expected sales value less variable costs to dispose for the year ended december 31 2008 approximately 707 million of initial 874 million in the inventory step up for the catalyst amis and adi acquisitions has been expensed to the statement of operations since the inventory was shipped to the customer leaving 167 million in inventory at december 31 2008 as this inventory is shipped to customers it will significantly decrease the gross margin reported on those future sales until the inventory is completely sold 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2001 a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets additionally throughout 2006 2007 and 2008 no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized as of december 31 2008 and 2007 gross deferred tax assets were 6723 million and 6191 million respectively and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was 6702 million and 6193 million respectively our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 

  

impairment of longlived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value when material these gains are recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

  

goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary our methodologies used for valuing goodwill during 2008 have not changed since 2007 

  

we have determined that our product families which are components of our operating segments constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill under sfas no 142 because they are one level below the operating segment they constitute individual businesses as defined in eitf no 983 “determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business” and our segment management regularly reviews the operating results of each product family as of each acquisition date all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date we determined the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using management’s assumptions and forecasts as of the acquisition date 

  

we perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year during the first step of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill for six of our product families may not be recoverable after completing the second step of our annual impairment analysis for those six product families we recognized a total charge of 5445 million of which 4163 million was from our custom and foundry product group 292 million from our automotive and power regulation group 59 million from our digital and consumer products group and 931 million from our computing products group 

  

we used the income approach based on estimated future cash flows to perform the goodwill impairment test these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues gross profits operating expenses and industry trends the material assumptions used for the income approach were five years of projected net cash flows a discount rate of 145 and a longterm growth rate of 3 we considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analyses 

  

the total fair value of the six impaired reporting units was 5810 million a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have impacted the fair value of the six impaired reporting units tested by approximately 477 million a one percentage point change in the longterm growth rate would have impacted the fair value by approximately 319 million 

  

our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed in our fourth quarter of 2009 however further declines in operating results and in our business outlook primarily due to the current macroeconomic environment may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods 

  

defined benefit plans we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees all of these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans for example as of december 31 2008 

  

a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately 39 million 

  

valuation of stock compensation  the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a latticebased option valuation model the lattice model uses 1 a constant volatility 2 an employee exercise behavior model based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior and 3 the treasury yield curve to calculate the fair value of shares issued for each option grant we continue to use the blackscholes optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of shares issued under the 2000 employee stock purchase plan 

  

contingencies we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree as well as the goodwill acquired significant changes from current practice resulting from sfas 141r include the expansion of the definitions of a “business” and a “business combination” for all business combinations whether partial full or step acquisitions the acquirer will record 100 of all assets and liabilities of the acquired business including goodwill generally at their fair values contingent consideration will be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and for certain arrangements changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings until settlement and acquisitionrelated transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the acquisition sfas 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas 141r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 earlier adoption is not permitted our adoption of sfas 141r relates specifically to future acquisitions and will be applied to the extent that future acquisitions occur 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas 160” sfas 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary specifically this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent’s equity the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement sfas 160 clarifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest in addition this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date sfas 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest sfas 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 earlier adoption is prohibited we have determined that the adoption of sfas 160 on january 1 2009 will have a significant impact on our balance sheet with an increase equity in the amount of approximately 173 million based on december 31 2008 balance of minority interest additionally the amount of net income attributed to the noncontrolling interest will now be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 

  

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas 161” sfas 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and 

  

hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows the provisions of sfas 161 are effective for any quarter ending after february 28 2009 our adoption of sfas 161 is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements

in may 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no apb 141 “fsp” the fsp specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments that permit or require the issuer to pay cash upon conversion should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods we will need to apply the guidance retrospectively to all past periods presented even to instruments that have matured converted or otherwise been extinguished as of the effective date the fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years we have determined that the adoption of apb 141 on january 1 2009 will have a material impact on the results of operations due to higher noncash interest expense and will initially improve our reported financial position as equity will increase by approximately 1341 million and debt will decrease by approximately 1341 million on our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 and out 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 additionally our estimated noncash interest expense will be approximately 347 million during 2009 

  

in june 2008 the emerging issues task force “eitf” issued issue no 0705 “determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity’s own stock” “issue 0705” eitf no 0705 addresses the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity’s own stock if an instrument or an embedded feature that has the characteristics of a derivative instrument is indexed to an entity’s own stock it is still necessary to evaluate whether it is classified in stockholders’ equity or would be classified in stockholders’ equity if it were a freestanding instrument in addition some instruments that are potentially subject to the guidance in eitf issue no 0019 “accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company’s own stock” “issue 0019” but do not have all the characteristics of a derivative instrument under paragraphs 6 through 9 it is still necessary to evaluate whether it is classified in stockholders’ equity it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 our adoption of issue 0705 is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” no fas 1404 and fasb interpretation no “fin” 46r8 “disclosures about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities” “fsp no fas 1404 and fin 46r8”   this fsp   amends   sfas no 140 “transfer of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” and fin 46 r “consolidation of variable interest entities” and requires enhanced disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities the additional disclosures provide greater transparency about a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets and an enterprise’s involvement with variable interest entities the fsp is effective for the first reporting period ending after december 15 2008 our adoption of fsp no fas 140and fin 46r8 is not expected to materially impact our results of operations or financial condition

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

  

at december 31 2008 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 11693 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 8868 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 2825 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately 14 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase 

  

one of our foreign exchange hedging agreement has a provision for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving facility is less than 25 million 

  

a majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however as a multinational business we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments this strategy reduces but does not eliminate the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements for example changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend   

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting  on october 10 2008 we acquired catalyst catalyst operated under its own set of systems and internal controls and we are currently maintaining those systems and much of that control environment until we are able to incorporate catalyst processes into our own systems and control environment we currently expect to complete the incorporation of catalyst’s operations into our systems and control environment in the second half of 2009 

  

there have been no other changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2008 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control — integrated framework  we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2008 

  

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 excluded amis and catalyst because they were acquired by the company in a purchase business combination during 2008 the total assets and total revenue of the amis represent 305 and 223 of consolidated total assets and consolidated total revenue respectively of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 2008 the total assets and total revenue of catalyst represent 43 and 04 of consolidated total assets and consolidated total revenue respectively of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 2008 registrants are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year if among other circumstances and factors there is not adequate time between the consummation date of the acquisition and the assessment date for assessing internal controls 

  

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” of this report

business overview 

  

on semiconductor corporation and its subsidiaries “we” “us” or “our” are a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components we design manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that address the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products our power management semiconductor components control convert protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our data management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all electronic devices these various products fall into the logic analog and discrete categories used by the world semiconductor trade statistics “wsts” group 

  

we serve a broad base of enduser markets including consumer electronics computing wireless communications automotive electronics industrial electronics and networking applications for our products in these markets include portable electronics computers game stations servers automotive and industrial automation control systems routers switches storagearea networks and automated test equipment 

  

our extensive portfolio of devices enables us to offer advanced integrated circuits and the “building block” components that deliver system level functionality and design solutions our product portfolio increased from approximately 28800 products in 2006 to approximately 29300 products in 2007 due to new product introductions and we shipped approximately 326 billion units in 2007 as compared to 306 billion units in 2006 we specialize in micro packages which offer increased performance characteristics while reducing the critical board space inside today’s ever shrinking electronic devices we believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products provides our customers with single source purchasing on a costeffective and timely basis 

  

we are organized into five operating segments which also represent five reporting segments automotive and power regulation computing digital and consumer standard products which include products that are sold in many different endmarkets and manufacturing services each of our major product lines has been assigned to a segment as illustrated in the table below based on our operating strategy because many products are sold into different end markets the total revenue reported for a segment is not indicative of actual sales in the end market associated with that segment but rather is the sum of the revenues from the product lines assigned to that segment our manufacturing services in which we manufacture parts for other semiconductor companies principally in our gresham oregon facility are reported in the manufacturing services segment these segments represent our view of the business and as such are used to evaluate progress of major initiatives from time to time we reassess the alignment of our product families and devices to our operating segments and may move product families or individual devices from one operating segment to another 

  

   

we have approximately 118 direct customers worldwide and we also service approximately 289 significant original equipment manufacturers indirectly through our distributor and electronic manufacturing service provider customers our direct and indirect customers include 1 leading original equipment manufacturers in a broad variety of industries such as motorola delta hewlittpackard samsung continental automotive systems siemens apple dell nokia intel and sony 2 electronic manufacturing service providers such as flextronics jabil and solectron and 3 global distributors such as arrow avnet ebv elektronik future solomon enterprise and world peace 

  

we currently have major design operations in arizona california rhode island texas oregon china slovakia the czech republic korea ireland and france and we currently operate manufacturing facilities in arizona oregon china the czech republic japan malaysia the philippines and slovakia in the first quarter of 2007 we announced the planned closing of our arizona manufacturing facilities for cost savings purposes the wafer manufacturing that takes place at this facility is being transferred to our offshore lowcost manufacturing facilities during the fourth quarter of 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell the wafer fabrication facility and associated land for approximately 16 million subject to various conditions and certain adjustments if the sale is completed at the originally contracted price we expect to record gains totaling approximately 98 million the sale is scheduled to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2008 we also continue to market additional unused portions of our property at our corporate headquarters in arizona and plan to use some of the proceeds from the sale to upgrade portions of our corporate headquarters during the second quarter of 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell three parcels of land totaling approximately 22 acres for approximately 123 million subject to various conditions and certain adjustments if the sale is completed at the originally contracted price we expect to record gains totaling approximately 110 million over the next three to four quarters the remaining unused building is currently being marketed for sale we will maintain our headquarters offices and remaining manufacturing facilities on the portions of the property that are not for sale

on may 3 2000 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock the net proceeds were used to redeem all outstanding preferred stock including accrued dividends and redeem or prepay debt on september 7 2001 we obtained 1000 million 992 million net of issuance costs through an equity investment by an affiliate of tpg who became our principal shareholder in this transaction we issued 10000 shares of redeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock in november 2005 we entered into a conversion and termination agreement with tpg to convert our redeemable convertible preferred stock into approximately 494 million shares of our common stock to induce the conversion we issued approximately 39 million additional shares of our common stock to tpg following the conversion none of the authorized shares of our preferred stock remained outstanding see note 11 “redeemable preferred stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” both included elsewhere in this report as of december 31 2006 tpg owned approximately 33 or 954 million shares of our outstanding shares of common stock during 2007 tpg sold all of its remaining shares of our common stock and ceased being our principal stock holder 

  

on may 15 2006 we through our principal domestic operating subsidiary sci llc purchased lsi logic corporation’s “lsi” gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility including real property tangible personal property certain intangible assets other specified manufacturing equipment and related information the assets 

  

purchased include an approximately 83 acre campus with an estimated 500000 square feet of building space of which approximately 98000 square feet is clean room we hired substantially all of the manufacturing and engineering employees working at the gresham wafer fabrication facility at the time of purchase at the closing of the transaction we also entered into several ancillary agreements including but not limited to a wafer supply and test agreement intellectual property license agreement transition services agreement and facility use agreement the aggregate purchase price for the acquired assets was 1065 million which included 15 million in transaction related costs plus an additional 11 million of certain net assets and liabilities that were assumed by sci llc when the purchase was finalized on may 15 2006 the aggregate purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased based on their relative fair values see note 6 “acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion 

  

on december 13 2007 we entered into a merger agreement with amis holdings inc a delaware corporation “amis” under which amis will become our whollyowned subsidiary the merger agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to be completed within the first six months of 2008 consummation of the merger is subject to several closing conditions including shareholder approval by both companies at the effective time of the merger each issued and outstanding share of common stock of amis will be converted into the right to receive 1150 shares of our common stock which had an estimated value of 8941 million when the merger was announced on december 13 2007 consummation of the merger is subject to several closing conditions 

  

on december 31 2007 we purchased from analog devices inc and its subsidiaries “adi” certain assets including property plant and equipment and intellectual property rights related to adi’s voltage regulation and thermal monitoring products for its computing applications business “ptc business” as part of the purchase we offered employment to substantially all of adi’s employees involved in the ptc business we also entered into several ancillary agreements including a licensing agreement a oneyear manufacturing supply agreement with adi as the supplier a transition services agreement and an escrow agreement covering certain postclosing indemnification obligations of adi the total acquisition cost of 1480 million of cash included 1470 million paid to adi for the ptc business and approximately 10 million in legal accounting and appraisal fees related to the transaction in addition the company entered into a 369 million supply agreement for inventory as a result of the acquisition we expect that the technical expertise customer relationships and power management knowhow of the ptc business and its employees will expand our overall computing power management business and accelerate its notebook power management revenue see note 6 “acquisitions” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion 

  

we used cash on hand to repurchase 5000000 shares of our common stock during the second quarter of 2007 at a price of 1105 per share these shares were acquired for general corporate purposes neither these shares nor shares previously repurchased by us had been reissued or retired as of december 31 2007 

  

debt financings and cost savings initiatives 

  

since our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors during 2002 and 2003 we engaged in several debt refinancing transactions which extended a portion of our debt maturities some of the transactions that extended our debt maturities also resulted in an increase in our overall interest expense and others lowered our overall interest expense in connection with these transactions we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things make our financial covenants less restrictive on the whole 

  

since 2003 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt and related interest costs as a result of these measures we reduced our total debt from 13029 million as of december 31 2003 to 11594 million as of december 31 2007 we also reduced our interest expense from 1511 million for the year ended december 31 2003 to 388 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

  

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 9 “longterm debt” and note 12 “common stock treasury stock and net income per share” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details on these financing activities that led to our reduced debt levels and annual interest expense 

  

although we have production at several locations we have initiated process improvements and selective capital acquisitions that we expect will increase our overall capacity our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on

customers 

  

we have been doing business with 39 of our 50 largest customers for more than five years sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but do not require minimum purchase commitments most of our original equipment manufacturer customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year while our other customers including electronic manufacturer service providers generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of end markets computing automotive electronics consumer electronics industrial electronics wireless communications and networking sales to our largest customers avnet arrow and motorola accounted for approximately 11 7 and 4 respectively of our revenues during 2007 as compared to 11 9 and 7 respectively of our revenues during 2006 and 13 9 and 10 respectively of our revenues during 2005 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of i three years from the date of shipment or ii the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog” below 

  

end market for our products 

  

the following table sets forth our principal enduser markets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each enduser market during 2007 sample applications for our products and representative original equipment manufacturer customers and end users 

  

   

   

original equipment manufacturers direct sales to original equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately 39 of our revenues in 2007 38 of our revenues in 2006 and 41 of our revenues in 2005 these customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as motorola delta hewlittpackard samsung continental automotive systems siemens apple dell nokia intel and sony and in the automotive industry include daimlerchrysler delphi trw and visteon we focus on three types of original equipment manufacturers multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core original equipment manufacturer customers the target market customers in the communications power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are original equipment manufacturers that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

  

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 50 of our revenues in 2007 and 48 of our revenues in each of 2006 and 2005 our distributors which include arrow avnet ebv elektronik future solomon enterprise and world peace resell to midsized and smaller original equipment manufacturers and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reasonably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 

  

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 10 of our revenues in 2007 14 of our revenues in 2006 and 11 of our revenues in 2005 our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are flextronics jabil and solectron these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many original equipment manufacturers now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace 

  

see part ii item 7 “management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this report for revenues by geographic locations 

  

  

manufacturing operations 

  

we operate our manufacturing facilities either directly or through a joint venture five of these facilities are frontend wafer sites located in japan slovakia the czech republic malaysia and the united states and three of such facilities are assembly and test sites located in china malaysia and the philippines in addition to these manufacturing and assembly operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 

  

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities the sizes of the locations represent the approximate gross square footage of each site’s building and include among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

  

   

we operate an assembly and test operations facility in leshan china this facility is owned by a joint venture company leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited “leshan” of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is formerly a stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 81 of leshan’s production capacity in 2007 and 85 in both 2006 and 2005 and are currently committed to purchase approximately 75 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2008 in 2007 and 2006 we did not incur any underutilization charges in 2005 we incurred 02 million in underutilization charges as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan we supply die used in the production process 

  

the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations and we anticipate that any future expansion of our manufacturing capacity would involve this facility in june 2002 we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to 231 million in semiconductor operations 

  

which is in addition to the 278 million originally approved in 2004 we committed to make capital contributions of approximately 25 million to this joint venture by 2012 subject to market conditions we have the ability to time these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand 

  

in 2006 we acquired an additional interest in our investment in leshan for 92 million for which the incremental interest in the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets had an estimated fair value of 54 million resulting in 38 million of goodwill 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including ait ase kec magnachip phenitec and psi accounted for approximately 22 24 and 25 of our manufacturing costs in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

raw materials 

  

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a justintime basis and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table showing commitments contingencies and indemnities in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this report from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

sales marketing and distribution 

  

as of december 31 2007 our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 364 professionals operating out of approximately 30 offices which serve customers in 38 countries we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective internetbased applications support from our laboratories in the czech republic china and the united states through online connectivity applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions since 2004 our cost structure related to freight shipping and logistical services has been improved as a result of our newest global distribution centers in the philippines and shanghai china which also resulted in improved domestic shipping and customs clearance operations we continue to monitor our freight and logistical support operations for potential cost savings 

  

patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights 

  

we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor ® and our on logo we own rights to a number of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property directly related to and important to our business in connection with our 1999 recapitalization motorola assigned licensed or sublicensed to us as the case may be certain intellectual property to support and continue the operation of our business as of january 15 2008 we had approximately 632 us and foreign patents and approximately 751 patent applications pending worldwide our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2008 to 2026 none of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business additionally we have rights to more than 240 registered and common law trademarks our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 

  

  

as part of the recapitalization motorola assigned to us approximately 295 us patents and patent applications approximately 292 foreign patents and patent applications rights to over 50 trademarks not including the motorola name previously used in connection with our products rights in knowhow relating to at least 39 semiconductor fabrication processes and rights in specified copyrightable materials in addition motorola licensed on a nonexclusive royaltyfree basis other patent trademark copyright and knowhow rights used in connection with our then existing products and products contemplated in our longrange plans we have perpetual royaltyfree worldwide rights under motorola’s patent portfolio and other intellectual property existing as of the date of our recapitalization or created in the five years thereafter the fiveyear period existing only with respect to patents as necessary to manufacture market and sell our then existing and long range plan product lines additionally motorola provided us with a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from certain infringement claims by third parties who had granted motorola licenses as of the date of our recapitalization which assisted us in developing our own patent position and licensing program through these arrangements we have the right to use a significant amount of motorolaowned technology used in connection with the products we currently offer 

  

seasonality 

  

our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related end markets in 2005 2006 and 2007 this pattern has shifted to more of a seasonally soft first half with a stronger second half as our products have increasingly become more consumer driven 

  

backlog 

  

our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders or customer agreements that are booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demands from our electronic data interface customers in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times because we record revenues on a “sellthrough” basis backlog comprised of orders from distributors will not result in revenues until the distributors sell the products ordered during 2007 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 80 and 86 of actual revenues during such quarter as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases customers tend to order products further in advance and as a result backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 

  

in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 

  

we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for generalpurpose semiconductor products like ours is highly competitive although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block 

  

semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products see part i item 1a “risk factors — trends risks and uncertainties related to other aspects of our business — elsewhere in this report 

  

we compete with respect to our four primary operating segments automotive and power regulation computing products digital and consumer products and standard products in the following manner 

  

automotive and power regulation 

  

the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation technical performance quality service and price our competitive strengths in this group are our strong technology and design resources our industry recognition in applications such as automotive and computing and our market share our significant competitors in this market include fairchild linear technology maxim national semiconductor st microelectronics and texas instruments several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions a competitive challenge in this group is our small market share with certain japanese automotive customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs if we are not identified as a vendor in the product design phase in most cases it is difficult to convince the manufacturer of the product to substitute our components during the production phase 

  

computing products 

  

the principal methods of competition in this group are technical performance total cost of solution ownership quality and assurance of supply our dualedge architecture for our microprocessor and ddr memory controllers offers a competitive costofownership and performance position to compete with incumbent suppliers in addition the breadth of our portfolio in other support functions dcdc converters over voltage protection fets and analog give us the opportunity to serve multiple requirements and allow customers to control their vendor lists more easily our significant competitors in this market include intersil international rectifier fairchild and infineon several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 

  

digital and consumer products 

  

the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation especially in packaging technical performance price quality and assurance of supply our competitive strengths in this group are our ability to put rf and emi filters and fets products in ever smaller packages without significantly degrading performance our significant competitors in this market include national maxim fairchild infineon international rectifier philips st microelectronics and vishay several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 

  

standard products 

  

our competitive strength in this area is the breadth of our portfolio our low cost structure high quality and our supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation and constantly introducing new packages and performance spins on existing products of particular importance are our over voltage protection portfolios esd protection tvs 

  

zeners and our clock management and distribution portfolios where we enjoy significant performance advantages over our competition our significant competitors in this market include fairchild diodes nxp international rectifier vishay micrel idtics st microelectronics texas instruments and semtech 

  

research and development 

  

companysponsored research and development costs in 2007 2006 and 2005 were 1330 million 85 of revenue 1012 million 66 of revenue and 937 million 74 of revenues respectively our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications during 2007 research and development spend increased due to the porting of existing products development of new products and expansion of our digital production capabilities in our gresham fab it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly we deploy people and capital with the goal to maximize our investment in research and development and to position us for continued growth as such we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity analog standard component mos power and clock and data management products we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 

  

government regulation 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 

  

our manufacturing facility in phoenix arizona is located on property that is a “superfund” site a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to cleanup activities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of onsite solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and offsite contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter during the fourth quarter 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell the wafer fabrication facility and associated land at our phoenix site the sale is scheduled to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2008 during the second quarter of 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell three parcels of land at our phoenix site totaling approximately 22 acres these sales are expected to be finalized by the end of 2008 additionally one of our unused buildings at our phoenix site is currently being marketed for sale 

  

manufacturing facilities in slovakia and the czech republic have ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that these facilities were operated by governmentowned entities in each matter these remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located onsite and offsite with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded at each of the respective locations the governments of the czech republic and slovakia have agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries subject to specified limitations for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination based upon the information available we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 

  

our design center in east greenwich rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination when we purchased the east greenwich facility we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property based on the information available we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

  

we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and liability for currently known environmental conditions to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects it is possible however that future developments including changes in laws and regulations government policies customer specification personnel and physical property conditions including currently undiscovered contamination could lead to material costs 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 11658 employees worldwide we do not currently have any collective bargaining arrangements with our employees except for those arrangements such as workers councils that are obligatory for all employees or all employers in a particular industry under applicable foreign law of the total number of our employees as of december 31 2007 approximately 10113 were engaged in manufacturing and information services approximately 616 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization which includes customer service approximately 356 were engaged in administration and approximately 573 were engaged in research and development

trends risks and uncertainties related to the potential merger and reorganization of amis with and into orange acquisition corporation inc a wholly owned subsidiary of the company “merger sub” 

  

the issuance of shares of our common stock to amis stockholders in the potential merger will substantially dilute the interest held by our stockholders prior to the merger 

  

as soon as practicable a special meeting of our stockholders will be held to vote on the merger between amis and us as well as other items further elaborated on in amendment no 1 to the form s4 filed with the sec on february 8 2008 if the merger is completed we will issue up to approximately 1028 million shares of our common stock in the merger based on the number of shares amis common stock outstanding and our common stock outstanding on the respective record dates amis stockholders will own in the aggregate approximately 26 of the shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after the merger on a fully diluted basis the issuance of shares of our common stock to amis stockholders in the merger and to holders of assumed options and restricted stock unit awards to acquire shares of amis common stock will cause a 

  

significant reduction in the relative percentage interest of our current stockholders in earnings voting liquidation value and book and market value 

  

the uncertainty about the completion of the merger and the diversion of management could harm us whether or not the merger is completed 

  

in response to the announcement of the potential merger with amis our existing or prospective customers may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions or they may seek to change their existing business relationship in addition as a result of the merger current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us and we could lose key employees as a result in addition to retention these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel completion of the merger will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships 

  

failure to complete the merger could adversely affect our stock price future business and financial results 

  

completion of the merger is conditioned upon among other things the receipt of certain antitrust approvals under the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions and approval of our stockholders and of amis’s stockholders there is no assurance that we will receive all of the necessary approvals or satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the merger failure to complete the proposed merger could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger we will also remain liable for significant transaction costs including legal accounting and financial advisory fees in addition the market price of our common stock may reflect various market assumptions as to whether the merger will occur consequently the completion of or failure to complete the merger could result in a significant change in the market price of our common stock 

  

the ability to complete the merger with amis is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities which may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or could cause us to abandon the merger 

  

in deciding whether to grant antitrust and competition approvals the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the merger on competition within their relevant jurisdictions the terms and conditions of the approvals that are granted if accepted may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of our business following the merger 

  

we cannot provide any assurance that we will obtain the necessary approvals or that any other conditions terms obligations or restrictions sought to be imposed and if accepted would not have a material adverse effect on us following the merger in addition we can provide no assurance that these conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger for additional information see note 4 “pending acquisition” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion 

  

the anticipated benefits of the merger with amis including anticipated costs savings may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

  

the merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently with principal offices in two distinct locations due to legal restrictions we are able to conduct only limited planning regarding the integration of amis with us prior to completion of the merger we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the two companies delays in this process could adversely affect our business financial results financial condition and stock price following the merger 

  

we estimate that approximately 50 million in pretax savings in 2009 may be achieved through the integration of amis into our business and rationalization of our combined infrastructure with amis as with any 

  

estimate it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be incorrect moreover even if we were able to integrate amis’s business operations successfully there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time 

  

additionally as a condition to their approval of the merger regulatory agencies may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our combined business with amis if we were able to agree to these requirements limitations costs divestitures or restrictions with amis and the regulatory agencies then our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger may be impaired 

  

we will incur significant transaction and mergerrelated costs in connection with the merger with amis 

  

we expect to incur significant costs associated with completing the merger and combining the operations ami with our business the exact magnitude of these costs is not yet known in addition there may be unanticipated costs associated with the integration although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs and other efficiencies may offset incremental transaction and mergerrelated costs over time these benefits may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

  

resales of shares of our common stock following the merger with amis additional obligations to issue shares of our common stock and repurchases of our common stock may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

  

as of february 4 2008 we had approximately 292687576 million shares of common stock outstanding and approximately 23239411 million shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and other rights to purchase or acquire its shares we currently expect that we will issue approximately 1028 million shares of our common stock in connection with the merger the issuance of these new shares of our common stock and the sale of additional shares of our common stock that may become eligible for sale in the public market from time to time upon exercise of options including a substantial number of our options that will replace existing amis options and other equitylinked securities could have the effect of depressing the market price for shares of our common stock 

  

in connection with the announcement of the merger agreement and the merger with amis we also announced that we have increased the number of shares of our common stock authorized for repurchase under our share repurchase program from 30 million shares to 50 million shares any repurchases could have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock above levels that would have otherwise prevailed or preventing or slowing a decline in the market price of our common stock 

  

see later in this report 1 “risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties related to other aspects of our business” for risks associated with a purported stockholder class action lawsuit against amis and others in connection with the proposed merger between amis and us and 2 “risk factors—trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness” for risks associated with the repayment or refinancing of amis’s debt concurrent with the completion of the proposed merger between amis and us 

  

trends risks and uncertainties related to other aspects of our business 

  

we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and operating losses in the future 

  

at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses although recently we have experienced some strength in our results over the course of the past couple fiscal years reduced enduser demand price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our 

  

business and we may experience declines in revenue and operating losses in the future in order to remain profitable we must continue to successfully implement our business plan including our cost reduction initiatives we also currently face an environment of uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our recent profitability 

  

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

  

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices in some ways we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience such downturns in the future we can not accurately predict the timing of future downturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these downturns might be future downturns in the semiconductor industry or any failure of the industry to fully recover from downturns could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may experience difficulties in operating the gresham manufacturing facility including the inability to utilize this additional capacity in a costefficient manner and to successfully develop new products which can be manufactured in this facility 

  

on may 15 2006 we acquired the gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility and hired substantially all of the manufacturing and engineering employees working at the gresham facility our ability to achieve the benefits we anticipated from the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility depend in large part upon whether we are able to operate this facility in an efficient and costeffective manner if we are unable to operate this facility successfully we may be unable to realize the cost savings revenue growth gross margin improvement earnings growth and other anticipated benefits we expected to achieve as a result of the acquisition and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

in connection with the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility we entered into a supply contract with lsi the previous owner of the facility which is due to expire on may 14 2012 at the end of 2008 lsi will no longer have any obligation to purchase a minimum commitment under this supply contract and their purchases may decrease significantly thereafter our ability to generate operating profits in the gresham manufacturing facility will likely depend upon our successful development of new products that can be produced using the technology of the gresham manufacturing facility as well as our ability to transfer existing products to the gresham manufacturing facility failure to successfully develop or integrate new products into the gresham manufacturing facility or to successfully market those new products could result in a loss of market share in the industry or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and ultimately could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 

  

our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization 

  

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits as a percentage of total revenues gross profit was 377 for 2007 compared to 385 for 2006 and 332 for 2005 gross profit improved in 2006 and 2005 as a result of increased sales volume andor cost savings from our profitability enhancement programs the lower gross profit rate in 2007 is attributable to lower manufacturing services revenue in 2007 and a full year of operating expenses increased competition and other factors may lead to price erosion lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

  

  

the failure to implement as well as the completion and impact of our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 

  

from time to time we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to among other things significant downturns in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead we recorded net restructuring charges of 30 million in 2007 69 million in 2006 and 33 million in 2005 to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives over the past three years these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments as well as gains on the sale of assets and insurance recoveries on january 31 2008 we announced that we intend to accelerate our standalone cost reduction programs including a continued focus on the consolidation of our manufacturing operations over the course of the next 12 to 18 months or so we have identified a total of over 40 million in annualized savings through actions that we have already taken and actions we expect to take the rate of these savings is expected to increase over that period to greater than 10 million per quarter however we cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will be successfully implemented or will sufficiently help us sustain our profitability because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 

  

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

  

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 continue to aggressively manage maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 further expand our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 rationalize our manufacturing operations 7 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 8 reduce selling and administrative expenses 9 manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands 10 actively manage working capital 11 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 12 focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

  

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other things to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

  

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

  

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 

  

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

  

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty we routinely purchase inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason furthermore short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

  

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

  

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for semiconductor components is highly competitive as a result of the recent economic downturn competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 

  

the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness many of our competitors particularly larger 

  

competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories and presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

  

because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 

  

we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends 

  

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

  

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

  

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other things capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

  

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing and information technology and equipment to remain competitive the failure inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

  

semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices we maintain certain of our own manufacturing assembly and test facilities which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 

  

we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency any such implementation however can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or in some instances to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned in the case of abandonment we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

  

ultimately we may be required to increase our future capital expenditures to meet our operational needs in among other areas manufacturing information technology and equipment we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in these or other areas in addition our principal credit agreement limits the amount of our capital expenditures which may restrict our ability to make expenditures we feel are necessary to be operationally successful 

  

if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

  

product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

  

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including polysilicon silicon wafers gold copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

in addition for some of our products we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 

  

we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses incurring additional debt assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 

  

in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities we have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions mergers and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts among other concerns successful 

  

acquisitions and alliances are subject to the following risks and uncertainties 1 the difficulty of integrating aligning and coordinating organization which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures 2 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions 3 the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets 4 the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 5 the risk of diverting the attention of senior management and other key employees from our daytoday operations and key research and development marketing or sales efforts 6 the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience 7 risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems 8 difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses and 9 future impairments of goodwill of an acquired business in addition key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of changeincontrol agreements acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equitybased compensation rights 

  

in addition we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results 

  

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

  

a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the asiapacific region and europe including the middle east respectively we maintain significant operations in seremban malaysia carmona the philippines aizu japan leshan china roznov the czech republic and piestany the slovak republic in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

  

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and financial personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive for example 

  

analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel as employee incentives we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time we have also issued restricted stock units with timebased vesting our stock price at times has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

  

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty patents or other intellectual property rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

  

we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 

  

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

  

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged intellectual property rights 

  

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

  

all industries including the semiconductor industry are subject to legal claims with and without merit including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general we are involved in a variety of legal matters most of which we consider routine matters that arise in the normal course of business these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers employment and labor and intellectual property we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however defense and settlement costs can be substantial even with respect to claims that have no merit due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

as mentioned above from time to time we have been or may in the future be involved in securities litigation we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any securities litigation matter in which we are party these types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for more information on our legal proceedings including our pending securities class action litigation 

  

in addition to our own litigation matters on december 27 2007 a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in bannock county idaho district court against amis its directors and two of amis’s 

  

largest stockholders alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to amis’s stockholders in connection with the proposed merger between amis and us while amis believes that this lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend against it vigorously this litigation may have a material adverse effect on the potential merger or on our financial condition if it continues past the consummation of the merger for additional information regarding this amis lawsuit see the section entitled “the merger—litigation relating to the merger” in our amendment no 1 to the form s4 filed with the sec on february 8 2008 

  

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

  

like most publiclytraded companies we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and external resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm we have completed this section 404 process for fiscal 2007 and have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2007 however we have not been able to ascertain the impact that the merger with amis will have in the future on our ability to maintain internal control over financial reporting amis reported in its quarterly report on form 10q for the fiscal quarter ended september 29 2007 that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of september 29 2007 as a result of a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting see amis’s quarterly report on form 10q for the fiscal quarter ended september 29 2007 for more information on this material weakness we have not assessed the impact that amis’s material weakness will have on our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting and will not be able to adequately do so until after the proposed merger is completed there can be no assurance that the combined company or its independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company’s internal controls in the future if internal controls over financial reporting are not considered adequate the combined company may experience a loss of public confidence which could have a material adverse effect on its business and stock price 

  

see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 

  

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other things regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 

  

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

  

   

  

   

   

   

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

  

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

  

we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations in addition we may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

  

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness currently restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness but do not fully prohibit our subsidiaries from doing so while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next 12 months if we incur additional debt the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities moreover some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness ultimately we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms or at all and we may need to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 

  

in addition if the proposed merger with amis is completed we will be required to repay or refinance all of amis’s outstanding debt concurrent with completion of the merger as of september 29 2007 the aggregate principal amount of amis’s outstanding debt was approximately 2775 million we expect to refinance all or a portion of amis’s outstanding debt with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from one or multiple financing transactions including pursuant to the accordion feature of our existing senior bank credit facility factoring arrangements saleleaseback transactions and additional debt financing which we are currently exploring but for which we do not have contractual commitments although the total dollar amount of this refinancing could be significant we do not believe that it will impair the ability of our combined businesses to maintain sufficient working capital we believe that we will be able to successfully complete the repayment or refinancing of amis’s outstanding debt although due to prevailing market conditions such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us 

  

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

  

our debt agreements contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

  

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

  

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

  

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

further if the merger with amis fails to be completed our stock price may also be adversely affected see “failure to complete the merger could adversely affect our stock prices and our future business and financial results” risk factor above 

  

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had a significant variance and we can not accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 

  

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

to our knowledge we have no unresolved staff comments which would require disclosure under this item 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

in the united states our corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing design center and research and development operations are located in approximately 145 million square feet of building space on property that we own in phoenix arizona we also lease properties around the world for use as sales offices design centers research and development labs warehouses logistic centers and trading offices the size andor location of these properties change from time to time based on business requirements we operate distribution centers which are leased or contracted through a third party in locations throughout asia europe and the americas we own our manufacturing facilities in the united states japan malaysia the philippines slovakia and the czech republic these facilities are primarily manufacturing operations but also include office utility laboratory warehouse and unused space our joint venture in leshan china also owns manufacturing warehouse laboratory office and unused space 

  

in december 2003 we announced our decision to phase out manufacturing operations at our facility in east greenwich rhode island we completed this closure during the fourth quarter of 2005 we transferred the production from this facility to our lower cost manufacturing facilities we completed the sale of the manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of 2006 we still own and occupy an approximately 58000 square foot design center in east greenwich rhode island 

  

in the second quarter of 2006 we purchased an approximately 500000 square foot manufacturing facility in gresham oregon this site is 83 acres and includes 98000 square feet of clean room 

  

as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola conveyed to us the surface rights to a portion of the land located at our phoenix facility excluding the subsurface rights and conveyed buildings located at the phoenix facility these buildings do not include any treatment facilities relating to motorola’s environmental cleanup operations at the phoenix facility we executed a declaration of covenants easements and restrictions with motorola providing access easements for the parties and granting to us options to purchase or to lease the subsurface rights of the land in 2005 we announced plans to sell unused portions of the phoenix arizona location in october 2006 we sold a portion of the phoenix arizona site that included an unused warehouse and unused parking lot during the fourth quarter of 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell the wafer fabrication facility and associated land at our phoenix site the sale is scheduled to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2008 during the second quarter of 2007 we entered into an agreement to sell three parcels of land at our phoenix site totaling approximately 22 acres these sales are expected to be finalized by the end of 2008 additionally one of our unused buildings at our phoenix site is currently being marketed for sale the remainder of the phoenix site will continue as our corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing design center and research and development facility 

  

we believe that our facilities around the world whether owned or leased are well maintained we believe that we have sufficient access to productive capacity to meet our needs for the majority of the products in our business lines for the foreseeable future 

  

we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and similar assets of each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries but no more than 65 of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries held by them to secure our senior bank facilities 

  

see part i item 1 “manufacturing operations” included elsewhere in this report for further details on our properties 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on information currently available management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters including the matters described or referred to in the next paragraphs will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable our business financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  

securities class action litigation 

  

during the period july 5 2001 through july 27 2001 we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our former officers current and former directors and the underwriters for our initial public offering the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york as abrams v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6114 breuer v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6287 and cohen v on semiconductor corp et al ca no 01cv6942 “district court” on april 19 2002 the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint alleges among other things that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters’ excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately 300 other publiclytraded companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city which have all been transferred along with the case against us to a single federal district court judge for purposes of coordinated case management we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended and intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously the litigation process is inherently uncertain however and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us 

  

on july 15 2002 together with the other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them in addition the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual former officers and current and former directors who were named as defendants in our litigation and they are no longer parties to the litigation on february 19 2003 the district court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants in that ruling the district court granted in part and denied in part those motions as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws the district court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to replead these claims as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded the district court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well the district court also denied the underwriter defendants’ motion to dismiss in all respects 

  

in june 2003 upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation had it been approved by the district court this proposed settlement would have resulted in the dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elected to participate in the proposed settlement together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants this proposed settlement was conditioned on among other things a ruling by the district court that the claims against us and against the other issuers who had agreed to the settlement would 

  

be certified for class action treatment for purposes of the proposed settlement such that all investors included in the proposed classes in these cases would be bound by the terms of the settlement unless an investor opted to be excluded from the settlement in a timely and appropriate fashion 

  

on december 5 2006 the us court of appeals for the second circuit “court of appeals” issued a decision in in re initial public offering securities litigation that six purported class action lawsuits containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted against us could not be certified as class actions due in part to the court of appeals’ determination that individual issues of reliance and knowledge would predominate over issues common to the proposed classes on january 8 2007 the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking rehearing en banc of this ruling on april 6 2007the court of appeals denied the plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing of the court of appeals’ december 5 2006 ruling the court of appeals however noted that the plaintiffs remained free to ask the district court to certify classes different from the ones originally proposed which might meet the standards for class certification that the court of appeals articulated in its december 5 2006 decision the plaintiffs have since moved for certification of different classes in the district court 

  

in light of the court of appeals’ december 5 2006 decision regarding certification of the plaintiffs’ claims the district court entered an order on june 25 2007 terminating the proposed settlement between the plaintiffs and the issuers including us because any possible future settlement with the plaintiffs if a settlement were ever to be negotiated and ultimately agreed to would involve the certification of a class action for settlement purposes the impact of the court of appeals’ rulings on the possible future settlement of the claims against us cannot now be predicted 

  

on october 1 2007 the plaintiffs submitted their briefing in support of their motions to certify different classes in the six focus cases the issuer defendants and the underwriter defendants filed separate oppositions to those motions on december 21 2007 the motions to certify classes in the six focus cases are not yet fully briefed and remain pending in addition on august 14 2007 the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in the six focus cases on november 13 2007 the issuer defendants moved to dismiss the claims against them in the amended complaints in the six focus cases the underwriter defendants have also moved to dismiss the claims against them in the amended complaints in the six focus cases those motions to dismiss are not yet fully briefed and remain pending 

  

now that the proposed settlement has been terminated we intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously while we can make no promises or guarantees as to the outcome of these proceedings we believe that the final result of this action will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

executive overview 

  

this section presents summary information regarding our industry markets and operating trends only for further information regarding the events summarized herein you should read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in its entirety 

  

industry overview 

  

worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 2556 billion in 2007 an increase of 32 from 2477 billion in 2006 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market since 2003 

  

  

    

following the unprecedented semiconductor industry revenue declines of 2001 the semiconductor industry began to show signs of stability in 2002 and grew more robust in both 2003 and 2004 worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by 68 in 2005 89 in 2006 and 32 in 2007 sales in our total addressable market grew by 142 in 2004 and 144 in 2003 reflecting increases in volume and slowing rates of price declines sales in our total addressable market remained stable in 2005 reflecting increases in volume that were offset by price declines sales in our total addressable market grew in 2006 reflecting increases in volume that exceeded the impact of further price declines sales in our total addressable market grew in 2007 reflecting increases in volume that exceeded the impact further declines the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately 66 during 2008 through 2010 these are projections and may not be indicative of actual results 

  

recent results 

  

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 were 15662 million an increase of 22 percent from 15318 million for the year ended december 31 2006 during 2007 we reported net income of 2422 million that included a restructuring asset impairment and other charges of 30 million during 2006 we reported net income of 2721 million that included 69 million in restructuring asset impairments and other benefits our gross margin decreased by approximately 80 basis points to 377 in 2007 from 385 in 2006 the primary reason for the decrease is attributable to the lower gross margin associated with manufacturing services revenue in 2007 versus 2006

based upon booking trends backlog levels anticipated manufacturing services revenue and estimated turns levels we anticipate that total revenues will be down approximately 3 to 7 in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to total revenues of 4079 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of 2008 were down from backlog levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2007 and represent over 90 of our anticipated first quarter 2008 revenues we expect that average selling prices for the first quarter of 2008 will be down approximately one percent sequentially we expect our total gross margin in the first quarter of 2008 to be approximately 355 to 365 and our product gross margin to be approximately 375 to 385 we expect the purchase accounting rules associated with our recent acquisition of the cpu voltage and pc thermal products group from analog devices inc will negatively impact our total gross margins by approximately 50 basis points in the first quarter of 2008 this impact is already included in our gross margin guidance we currently expect our stockbased compensation expense to be approximately 70 million in the first quarter of 2008 and amortization of intangibles associated with the cpu voltage and thermal products group to be approximately 25 million in the first quarter of 2008 

  

for the first quarter of 2008 we expect selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses at approximately 12 of revenues and research and development expenses at approximately 10 of revenues we anticipate that net interest expense and income tax provision will be approximately 75 million and 25 million respectively for the first quarter of 2008 we anticipate cash capital expenditures will be approximately 300 million in the first quarter of 2008 and total cash capital expenditures of approximately 1000 million to 1100 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

  

business overview 

  

we classify our products broadly as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components we design manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products our power management semiconductor components control convert protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our data management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all electronic devices these various products fall into the logic analog and discrete categories used by wsts 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand have reached levels above capacity production capabilities shortages have begun to occur which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

  

during 2007 we experienced an increase in the end market demand mostly offset by price decreases which resulted in slightly increased revenue compared to the previous year we expect price declines during 2008 to be moderate and we will continue to monitor the supply and demand picture to determine if pricing could be held or increased 

  

new product innovation 

  

as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives excluding the introduction of leadfree products we introduced 171 new product families in 2007 and 158 new product families in 2006 our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to 

  

customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications in light of the recent acquisition of the gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility we are increasing our research and development in deep sub micron power management solutions to further differentiate us from our competition as always it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position us for continued growth as a result we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity logic analog and discrete products we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 

  

cost savings and restructuring activities 

  

we continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and as a result we expect to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure during the first quarter of 2007 we announced plans to consolidate manufacturing efforts with the closing of one of our manufacturing facilities at our phoenix arizona location the wafer manufacturing that takes place at this facility is being transferred to our offshore lowcost manufacturing facilities and we expect this transfer to be completed during the last two fiscal quarters of 2008 after we have completed the transfer to other facilities we plan to exit the manufacturing facility at our phoenix location which is currently under agreement to be sold it is anticipated that approximately 80 employees will be terminated as a result of this consolidation effort in addition to approximately 30 positions that will be eliminated through normal attrition we expect the full annual cost savings from this consolidation to be at least 70 million to 90 million beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 

  

also in connection with this activity during the third quarter of 2007 we announced reductions in factory support functions at our phoenix arizona and gresham oregon locations which resulted in the elimination or transfer of 62 positions we expect the full annual cost savings from this announcement to be approximately 59 million beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 

  

although we have production at several locations we have initiated process improvements and selective capital acquisitions that we expect will increase our overall capacity our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on 

  

   

   

   

   

   

debt reduction and financing activities 

  

since the recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors during 2002 and 2003 we engaged in several debt refinancing transactions which extended a portion of our debt maturities since 2003 however we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt and related interest costs as a result of these measures we reduced our total debt from 13029 million as of december 31 2003 to 11594 million as of december 31 2007 similarly we have reduced our annual interest expense from 1511 million in 2003 to 388 million in 2007 also see “liquidity and capital resources” and note 9 “longterm debt” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 the amounts in the following table are in millions 

  

   

revenues 

  

net revenues were 15662 million 15318 million and 12606 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase from 2006 to 2007 was due to increased product volume partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 60 the increase from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to increased product volume and manufacturing services revenue resulting from the acquisition of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 5 the revenues by reportable segment in each of these three years were as follows dollars in millions 

  

  

   

revenues from automotive and power regulation increased from 2006 to 2007 and from 2005 to 2006 in 2007 this increase can be attributed to an increase in revenues from ac to dc conversion rectifier analog automotive auto power and dc to dc conversion products partially offset by a decrease in ldo and voltage regulator products in 2006 the increase can be attributed to an increase in revenues from ldo and voltage regulator rectifier ac to dc conversion and dc to dc conversion products partially offset by a decrease in revenue from analog automotive products 

  

revenues from computing products increased from 2006 to 2007 and from 2005 to 2006 the increase from 2006 to 2007 can be attributed to increased revenues from low and medium voltage mosfet and power switching products partially offset by decreases in signal and interface products the increase from 2005 to 2006 is primarily due to increases in revenues from low and medium voltage mosfet signal and interface and power switching products 

  

revenues from digital and consumer products increased from 2006 to 2007 and from 2005 to 2006 the increase from 2006 to 2007 can be attributed to increased revenues from filter low voltage and application specific integrated products the increase from 2005 to 2006 is primarily due to increased revenues from analog switch filter and low voltage products partially offset by decreased revenues from application specific integrated products 

  

revenues from standard products decreased from 2006 to 2007 and increased from 2005 to 2006 this segment consists of many products that are available from numerous competitors in the marketplace and is thus heavily influenced by pricing pressures and general market conditions the decrease in revenues from 2006 to 2007 is primarily attributed to decreases in revenues from standard logic high frequency thyristor bipolar power and zener products partially offset by increases in small signal and protection products the increase in revenues from 2005 to 2006 is largely attributed to increases in standard logic product revenues protection products and zener products 

  

additionally manufacturing services revenue decreased from 2006 to 2007 due to lower volume purchases by lsi in 2005 to 2006 revenue growth in manufacturing services is due to the manufacturing services revenue from the wafer supply agreement with lsi that began in may 2006 related to our purchase of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility 

  

revenues by geographic area as a percentage of revenues were as follows 

  

   

a majority of our end customers served directly or through distribution channels are manufacturers of electronic devices in recent years there has been a trend toward moving such manufacturing activities to lower cost regions particularly in asia our shift in revenues by geographic area reflects this trend 

  

for the year ended december 31 2007 two of our customers accounted for 11 and 8 of our net revenues respectively excluding manufacturing revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 two of our customers accounted for 11 and 9 of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 two of our customers accounted for 13 and 10 of our net revenues 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 5905 million 5890 million and 4185 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively as a percentage of revenues our gross profit was 377 385 and 332 in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively gross profit increased during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to cost reductions from our profitability enhancement programs and increased sales volume partially off set by decreases in average sales gross profit increased during 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to increased sales volume increased manufacturing service revenue from our gresham oregon wafer fabrication and a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately 202 million resulting from a change in our estimate of the useful life of our machinery and equipment assets partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices see note 5 “accounting changes” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the gross profit by reportable segment in each of these two years were as follows dollars in millions 

  

   

 

   

gross profit from automotive and power regulation decreased from 2006 to 2007 the decrease can be attributed to decreased gross profit from rectifier and ldo and voltage regulator products partially offset by increases from ac to dc conversion analog automotive and dc to dc conversion products gross profit from automotive and power regulation increased from 2005 to 2006 the increase can be attributed to increases in gross profit from ldo and voltage regulator rectifier acdc conversion analog automotive and dcdc conversion products 

  

gross profit from computing products increased from 2006 to 2007 the increase can be attributed to increased gross profit from low and medium voltage mosfet products partially offset by decreases from power switching products gross profit from computing products increased from 2005 to 2006 the increase can be attributed to increases in gross profit from low and medium voltage mosfet power switching and signal and interface products 

  

gross profit from digital and consumer products increased from 2006 to 2007 the increase can be attributed to increased gross profit from analog switch filter low voltage and application specific integrated products gross profit from digital and consumer products increased from 2005 to 2006 the increase can be attributed to increases in gross profit from analog switch filter and low voltage products partially offset by decreases in application specific power products 

  

gross profit from standard products remained relatively flat from 2006 to 2007 increases in protection products small signal and zener products were offset by decreases in standard logic high frequency thyristor and bipolar power products gross profit from standard products increased from 2005 to 2006 the increase can be attributed to increases in gross profit from protection zener small signal standard logic and thyristor products partially offset by decreases in high frequency products 

  

gross profit from manufacturing services decreased from 2006 to 2007 due to the decrease in volume of wafers sold to lsi gross profit from manufacturing services increased due to the added value from the purchase of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility in 2006 

  

certain costs incurred during the manufacturing process are not allocated to the reportable segments the decrease in unallocated manufacturing costs from 312 million in 2006 to 209 million in 2007 was due primarily to lower underutilized factory costs the decrease in unallocated manufacturing costs from 518 million in 2005 to 312 million in 2006 was due primarily to manufacturing costs we continued to incur at the east greenwich rhode island manufacturing facility in 2005 beyond the original anticipated closure date of that facility which were not allocated to the reportable segments similar costs were not incurred during 2006 due to the completion of the closure in 2005 

  

operating expenses 

  

research and development expenses were 1330 million 1012 million and 937 million representing 85 66 and 74 of revenues in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase from 2006 to 2007 was primarily attributable to increased employee salaries and wages and increased headcount and the costs to develop new products in our gresham wafer fabrication facility and the expansion of our digital production capabilities in our gresham wafer fabrication facility partially offset by decreases in employee performance bonuses the increase from 2005 to 2006 was primarily attributed to increased employee salaries and wages stock compensation expense and employee performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals partially offset by decreases in depreciation 

  

selling and marketing expenses were 946 million 910 million and 793 million representing 60 59 and 63 of revenues in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase from 2006 to 2007 was primarily attributed to increased employee salaries and wages and increased stock compensation expense partially offset by a decrease in employee performance bonuses the increase from 2005 to 2006 was primarily attributed to increases in employee performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals increased employee salaries and wages increased head count which include management and field application engineers and stock compensation expense 

  

general and administrative expenses were 827 million 867 million and 746 million representing 53 57 and 59 of revenues in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease from 2006 to 2007 was attributable to decreases in employee performance bonus partially offset by increased salaries and wages from higher headcount and legal fees for royalty disputes the increase from 2005 to 2006 was attributable to increases in stock compensation expense employee performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals increase in salaries and wages associated with higher head count and legal expenses 

  

other operating expenses — restructuring asset impairments and other 

  

restructuring asset impairments and other charges were 30 million 69 million and 33 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively our individual quarterly restructuring charges are summarized below for more information see note 7 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

operating income 

  

information about operating income from our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2007 december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 are as follows in millions 

  

  

   

depreciation and amortization expense is included in segment operating income reconciliations of segment information to financial statements follows in millions 

  

   

other unallocated operating expenses increased from 67 million in 2006 to 253 million in 2007 primarily due to increased costs to develop new products in our gresham wafer fabrication facility that impact all reportable segments 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 388 million 518 million and 615 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in interest expense from 2006 to 2007 was primarily a result of interest savings that resulted from the issuance of our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 in december 2006 with a large portion 1990 million used to reduce our senior bank facilities the decrease in interest expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily a result of interest savings that resulted from the repayment of our 10 junior subordinated note in the second half of 2005 which was partially financed with the proceeds from the issuance of the 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 our weightedaverage interest rate on longterm debt including current maturities was 34 49 and 54 per annum in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources — key financing events” for a description of our refinancing activities 

  

loss on debt prepayment 

  

loss on debt prepayment totaled 01 million and 13 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively during the first quarter of 2007 we incurred a loss on debt prepayment of 01 million resulting from the prepayment of 239 million of our senior bank facilities during the fourth quarter of 2006 we used proceeds from the 4840 million convertible notes and cash on hand to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities accordingly the 13 million loss on debt prepayment resulted from the write off of a portion of debt issuance costs associated with the senior bank facilities see “liquidity and capital resources — key financing events” for a description of our refinancing activities 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

provision for income taxes was 77 million 09 million and 15 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

the 2007 provision included 99 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 51 million of new reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions partially offset by the reversal of 73 million of previously accrued income taxes for anticipated audit issues 

  

the 2006 provision included 64 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 19 million of new reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions partially offset by the reversal of 74 million of previously accrued income taxes for anticipated audit issues 

  

the 2005 provision included 61 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 76 million of new reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions partially offset by the reversal of 95 million of previously accrued income taxes for anticipated audit issues and the reversal of a 27 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for one of our japanese subsidiaries that returned to profitability 

  

cumulative effect of accounting change 

  

cumulative effect of accounting change net of income taxes was 29 million in 2005 

  

in 2005 we recorded a 29 million charge net of taxes of 03 million upon adoption of fin 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” “fin 47” which requires recognition of liabilities for legal obligations to perform asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity see “accounting changes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fin 47 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements our sources and uses of cash our debt and debt covenants and our management of cash 

  

cash requirements 

  

commercial commitments contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and indemnities 

  

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt operating leases pension obligations and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

  

  

    

our longterm debt includes 1737 million under senior bank facilities 2600 million of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 950 million under our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 4840 million under our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 96 million under a note payable to a japanese bank 489 million under loan facilities with chinese banks 250 million under a note payable to philippine banks 05 million under a note payable to the state of oregon and 627 million of capital lease obligations see note 9 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

in the normal course of our business we enter into various operating leases for equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

  

our other longterm contractual obligations consist of estimated payments to fund liabilities that have been accrued in our consolidated balance sheet for our foreign pension plans see note 14 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report the us pension plan named the on semiconductor grandfathered pension plan “grandfathered plan” has been terminated effective december 31 2004 as approved by the pension benefit guaranty corporation in 2005 and such termination was determined by the internal revenue service not to adversely affect its qualification for federal 

  

tax purposes in connection with the termination of our grandfathered plan all cash funding requirements for the liability have been settled and the related plan assets have been distributed as of december 31 2005 the remaining obligation in the table above includes estimated funding requirements for liabilities related to our foreign pension plans 

  

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 2746 million at december 31 2007 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months our senior bank facilities include a 250 million revolving facility letters of credit totaling 33 million were outstanding under the revolving facility at december 31 2007 our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement has a provision for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving facility is less than 25 million 

  

on december 13 2007 we entered into a merger agreement with amis under which amis will become our whollyowned subsidiary the merger agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to be completed as soon as practicable after special meetings of shareholders of both us and amis scheduled for march 12 2008 consummation of the merger is subject to several closing conditions including shareholder approval by both companies at the effective time of the merger each issued and outstanding share of common stock of amis will be converted into the right to receive 1150 shares of our common stock which had an estimated value of 8941 million when the merger was announced on december 13 2007 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to intellectual property infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

  

we are a party to various agreements with motorola a former affiliate which were entered into in connection with our separation from motorola pursuant to these agreements we have agreed to indemnify motorola for losses due to for example breach of representations and warranties and covenants damages arising from assumed liabilities or relating to allocated assets and for specified environmental matters our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and payment by us is conditioned on motorola making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract which procedures typically allow us to challenge motorola’s claims 

  

we face risks of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall in one particular case we have agreed to indemnify a major customer for valid warranty claims on our products sold not to exceed two and one half times the total annual sales 

  

in connection with the acquisitions of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility and adi’s ptc business we entered into various agreements with lsi and adi respectively pursuant to certain of these agreements we agreed to indemnify lsi and adi respectively for certain things limited in the most instances by time andor monetary amounts 

  

we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

  

we provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

  

in addition to the above from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 

  

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for possible contingencies related to legal matters and see part i item 1 “business — government regulation” of this report for information on certain environmental matters see also part i item 1a “risk factors — trends risks and uncertainties related to other aspects of our business” of this report for risks and uncertainties associated with a purported stockholder class action lawsuit against amis and others in connection with the proposed merger between amis and us 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand and targeted asset sales additionally as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis in this regard we currently have a pending merger with amis if the proposed merger with amis is completed we will be required to repay or refinance all of amis’s outstanding debt concurrent with the completion of the merger as of september 29 2007 the aggregate principal amount of amis’s outstanding debt was approximately 2775 million we expect to refinance all or a portion of amis’s outstanding debt with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from one or multiple financing transactions including pursuant to the accordion feature of our existing senior bank credit facility factoring arrangements saleleaseback transactions sale of assets cash generated from operations and additional debt financing which we are currently exploring but for which we do not have contractual commitments although the total dollar amount of this refinancing could be significant we do not believe that it will impair the ability of our combined businesses to maintain sufficient working capital we believe that we will be able to successfully complete the repayment or refinancing of amis’s outstanding debt although due to prevailing market conditions such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us in addition on an ongoing basis amis will affect our internal cash utilization and capital expenditures as well as our liquidity 

  

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

  

   

   

our ability to service our longterm debt to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may beyond our control 

  

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through december 31 2008 to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

  

operations 

  

our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash and our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities each of these components is discussed herein 

  

ebitda 

  

earnings net income before interest expense interest income provisions for income taxes depreciation and amortization expense “ebitda” is a key indicator that management uses to evaluate our operating performance and cash flows not all of these items listed above are necessarily included in the calculation of net income each quarter while ebitda is a nongaap measure and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity we believe this measure provides important supplemental information to investors and is useful to investors to among other things assess our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditure and working capital requirements we use this measure together with gaap measures for internal managerial purposes and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons however we do not and you should not rely on nongaap financial measures alone as measures of our performance we believe that nongaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that — when taken together with gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures that we also provide in our reports — provide a more complete understanding of factors and treands affecting our business this calculation may differ in method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies the following table sets forth our ebitda for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 with a reconciliation to cash flows from operations the most directly comparable financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles in millions 

  

   

as a result of the improved operating performance we generated positive ebitda for 2007 2006 and 2005 ebitda for 2007 decreased to 3685 million largely due to the lower net income of 2422 million for the year ebitda for 2006 increased to 3944 million largely due to the generation of net income of 2721 million for the year 

  

as discussed in note 9 “longterm debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report our debt covenants require us to stay within certain leverage ratios based on the consolidated ebitda for the last four quarters consolidated ebitda as defined under the documents for our senior bank facilities totaled approximately 3957 million for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended december 31 2007 this consolidated ebitda computation excludes certain restructuring and other charges and contains other differences from the ebitda as defined above therefore ebitda in the above table is not representative of the consolidated ebitda used to determine our debt covenant compliance 

  

if we were not in compliance with the covenants contained in our senior bank facilities the holders of our senior bank facilities could cause all outstanding amounts which was 1737 million as of december 31 2007 to be due and payable immediately if we were unable to repay refinance or restructure that indebtedness the holders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any such event of default or declaration of acceleration could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity as of december 31 2007 approximately 8390 million remained outstanding under other debt that may be accelerated based on this covenant therefore the credit agreement for our senior bank facilities is a material agreement 

  

working capital 

  

working capital fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents was 498 million at december 31 2007 and has fluctuated between 313 million and 824 million over the last eight quarterends 

  

the components of our working capital at december 31 2007 and 2006 are set forth below in millions followed by explanations for changes between 2006 and 2007 for cash and cash equivalents and any other changes greater than 5 million 

  

   

the increase in cash and cash equivalents of 58 million in 2007 was attributable to cash flow from operations of approximately 3171 million partially offset by cash used in investing activities of 2761 million and cash used in financing activities of 355 million see “key financing events” below 

  

the increase of 78 million in inventory is attributable to finished goods inventory acquired from the adi acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2007 

  

the increase of 340 million in other current assets is primarily attributable to the prepaid supply contract associated with the adi acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2007 

  

the decrease in accrued expenses of 104 million was primarily attributable to the decreases in accrued employee performance bonuses accrued payroll and accrued vacation 

  

longterm assets and liabilities 

  

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets foreign tax receivables and capitalized debt issuance costs 

  

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties capital expenditures were 1407 million 1990 million and 461 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we will continue to look for opportunities to make similar strategic purchases in the future as we plan to invest in 2008 for additional capacity although our debt covenants contain certain restrictions that limit our amount of future capital expenditures we do not believe that these restrictions will have a significant impact on our future operating performance 

  

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans generally our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions see note 14 “employee benefit plans” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our tax reserves see note 10 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

key financing events 

  

overview 

  

since we became an independent company as a result of our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors our longterm debt includes amounts outstanding under our senior bank facilities which contain covenants with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2007 

  

during the second half of 2003 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt reduce related interest costs and in some cases extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility these measures have continued in 2007 set forth below is a summary of the key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years 

  

november 2005 conversion of redeemable preferred stock 

  

on november 10 2005 we entered into a conversion and termination agreement with an affiliate of tpg to convert our outstanding convertible redeemable preferred stock held by such affiliate with a book value of 1387 million and 1311 million as of september 30 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively into 

  

49364080 shares of our common stock we issued an additional 3949126 shares of common stock to the tpg affiliate to induce the conversion of the preferred stock following the conversion none of the authorized shares of the preferred stock remained outstanding in connection with the conversion and inducement we recognized a 204 million charge that reduced net income applicable to common stock for a deemed dividend from the issuance of inducement shares issued upon conversion 

  

december 2005 repayment of 10 junior subordinated notes and issuance of 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes 

  

as part of the recapitalization semiconductor components industries llc our primary domestic operating subsidiary issued a 910 million junior subordinated note due 2011 during periods it was outstanding the note bore interest at an annual rate of 100 compounded semiannually and payable at maturity the note was junior in right of payment to all senior debt in november 2005 we repaid 664 million of the junior subordinated note with cash on hand which reduced the outstanding principal amount to approximately 910 million 

  

in order to finance the repayment of the remaining principal amount of the junior subordinated note in december 2005 we issued 950 million of 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 we received net proceeds of approximately 910 million from the sale of the notes after deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses of 40 million which were capitalized as debt issuance costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method through the first put date of december 15 2012 the notes bear interest at the rate of 1875 per year from the date of issuance interest on the notes is payable on june 15 and december 15 of each year beginning on june 15 2006 the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries 

  

the notes are convertible by holders into cash and shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 1428571 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of notes subject to adjustment in certain events which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 700 per share of common stock we will settle conversion of all notes validly tendered for conversion in cash and shares of our common stock if applicable subject to our right to pay the share amount in additional cash holders may convert their notes under the following circumstances i during the five businessday period immediately following any five consecutive tradingday period in which the trading price per 1000 principal amount of notes for each day of such period was less than 103 of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate ii upon occurrence of the specified transactions described in the indenture relating to the notes or iii after june 15 2012 we determined that the conversion option based on a trading price condition meets the definition of a derivative and should be bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for separately however the fair value of this feature was determined to be de minimis at the date of issuance and we continue to evaluate the significance of this feature on a quarterly basis 

  

the notes will mature on december 15 2025 beginning december 20 2012 we may redeem the notes in whole or in part for cash at a price of 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the redemption date if a holder elects to convert its notes in connection with the occurrence of specified fundamental changes that occur prior to december 15 2012 the holder will be entitled to receive in addition to cash and shares of common stock equal to the conversion rate an additional number of shares of common stock in each case as described in the indenture notwithstanding these conversion rate adjustments these notes contain an explicit limit on the number of shares issuable upon conversion holders may require us to repurchase the notes for cash on december 15 of 2012 2015 and 2020 at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase date upon the occurrence of certain corporate events each holder may require us to purchase all or a portion of such holder’s notes for cash at a price equal to the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase date 

  

the notes are our unsecured obligations will be subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to all our existing and future subordinated obligations the notes also will be effectively subordinated to any of our and our subsidiaries’ secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness 

  

february 2006 amendment to senior bank facilities 

  

in february 2006 we refinanced the term loans under our senior bank facilities to reduce the interest rate from libor plus 275 to libor plus 250 the amended and restated credit agreement also provides for a step down provision that would further reduce the interest rate to libor plus 225 if we maintain a specified credit rating and meet a specified leverage ratio test that first applied based on the 2005 results 

  

march 2006 amendment to senior bank facilities 

  

the credit agreement relating to our senior bank facilities includes a provision requiring an annual calculation of cash flow as defined and the application of a portion of that cash flow as a prepayment of loans outstanding under the agreement in march 2006 we obtained an amendment of this provision that requires repayment only at the election of the debt holders

july 2006 exchange offer for zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 

  

on april 6 2004 we commenced a cash tender offer for all of our then outstanding 12 senior subordinated notes due 2009 in order to finance the cash tender offer we issued 2600 million of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 we received net proceeds of approximately 2512 million from the sale of the notes after deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses of 88 million which were capitalized as debt issuance costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method through the first put date of april 15 2010 the notes do not bear cash interest nor does the principal amount accrete the effective interest rate of the notes resulting from the amortization of debt issuance costs is 058 the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by certain existing and future subsidiaries of ours

debt instruments guarantees and related covenants 

  

the following table presents the components of longterm debt as of december 31 2007 and 2006 dollars in millions 

  

  

   

we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and similar assets of each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries but no more than 65 of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries held by them to secure our senior bank facilities 

  

semiconductor components industries llc the primary domestic operating subsidiary of on semiconductor corporation is the borrower under our senior bank facilities on semiconductor corporation and our other domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee on a joint and several basis the obligations of the borrower under such facilities on semiconductor corporation is the issuer and sci llc is a guarantor of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 our 1875 convertible senior subordinated

our senior bank facilities contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable should we exceed leverage and secured leverage ratios as specified therein any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

cash management 

  

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

  

accounting changes 

  

asset retirement obligations  

  

effective december 31 2005 we adopted fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” “fin 47” fin 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” “statement 143” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within 

  

the control of the entity fin 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a result of the adoption of fin 47 we recorded a 29 million net charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change in 2005 and we recorded a 40 million liability for asset retirement obligations included in other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

adoption of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

  

we or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions with few exceptions we are no longer subject to us federal state and local or nonus income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2002 

  

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january 1 2007 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we recognized approximately an 89 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted for as a reduction to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in millions 

  

   

the entire december 31 2007 balance of approximately 199 million relates to unrecognized tax positions that if recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate included in the 199 million balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2007 is 91 million related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could significantly change during the twelve months following december 31 2007 as a result of expiring statutes of limitations 

  

we recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense during the year ended december 31 2007 we recognized approximately 27 million in interest and penalties we had approximately 68 and 41 million for the payment of interest and penalties accrued at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america note 3 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contains a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

revenue  we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we also generate revenue although to a much lesser extent from manufacturing services provided to customers we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers and sales of manufacturing services net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that they have resold the products to the end user as a result of our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors we defer the related revenue and margin on sales to distributors although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

  

taxes assessed by government authorities on revenueproducing transactions including value added and excise taxes are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 

  

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty sales to distributors however are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under our general agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized and are netted against revenues given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products our actual returns and allowances and warranty claims have not traditionally fluctuated significantly from period to period and our returns and allowances and warranty provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of i three years from the date of shipment or ii the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge at the time revenue is recognized we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales recorded as a component of cost of revenues in addition we also offer cash discounts to customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time generally 10 days after shipment we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues based on experience with each customer 

  

freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense during the period in which they are incurred 

  

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2001 a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets additionally throughout 2005 2006 and 2007 no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized as of december 31 2007 and 2006 gross deferred tax assets were 6191 million and 6679 million respectively and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was 6193 million and 6650 million respectively our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 

  

impairment of longlived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value when material these gains are recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

  

goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary to date our goodwill has not been considered to be impaired based on the results of this first step 

  

defined benefit plans we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions 

  

including a discount rate for plan obligations assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees all of these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans for example as of december 31 2007 a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately 32 million 

  

valuation of stock compensation the fair value of each option grant in 2005 and thereafter is estimated on the date of grant using a latticebased option valuation model in past years the company has used the blackscholes optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of its options the latticebased model uses 1 a constant volatility 2 an employee exercise behavior model based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior and 3 the treasury yield curve to calculate the fair value of each option grant the company continues to use the blackscholes optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of shares issued under the 2000 employee stock purchase plan 

  

asset retirement obligations we recognize asset retirement obligations “aros” when incurred with the initial measurement at fair value these liabilities are accreted to full value over time through charges to income in addition asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s respective useful life our aros consist primarily of estimated decontamination costs associated with manufacturing equipment and buildings 

  

contingencies we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable sfas no 157 also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 although early adoption is permitted our adoption of sfas no 157 is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” “sfas 159” sfas no 159 permits an entity to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many financial assets and liabilities entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings entities electing the fair value option are required to distinguish on the face of the statement of financial position the fair value of assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and similar assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the adjustment to reflect the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount would be accounted for as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of initial adoption our adoption of sfas no 159 is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” “sfas 141r” which replaces fas 141 sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any controlling interest recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business 

  

combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination fas 141r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after an entity’s fiscal year that begins after december 15 2008 we will assess the impact of sfas 141r if and when a future acquisition occurs 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas 160” sfas 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary specifically this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent’s equity the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement sfas 160 clarifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains it controlling financial interest in addition this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date sfas 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest sfas 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 earlier adoption is prohibited we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

  

at december 31 2007 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 11594 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 9118 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 2476 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately 12 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents as a result of the higher rates 

  

our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement has a provision for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility becomes less than 25 million 

  

a majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however as a multinational business we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments this strategy reduces but does not eliminate the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements for example changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

none 

  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting  there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2007 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control — integrated framework  management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 excluded the ptc business because it was acquired by the company in a purchase business combination during 2007 the total assets and total revenue of the ptc business represent 90 of consolidated total assets and 00 of consolidated total revenue respectively of the company as of and for the year ended december 31 2007 registrants are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year if among other circumstances and factors there is not adequate time between the consummation date of the acquisition and the assessment date for assessing internal controls 

  

the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” of this report

business overview 

  

on semiconductor corporation and its subsidiaries “we” “us” or “our” are a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components we design manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that address the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products our power management semiconductor components distribute and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our data management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all electronic devices 

  

we serve a broad base of enduser markets including consumer electronics computing wireless communications automotive electronics industrial electronics and networking applications for our products in these markets include portable electronics computers game stations servers automotive and industrial automation control systems routers switches storagearea networks and automated test equipment 

  

our extensive portfolio of devices enables us to offer advanced integrated circuits and the “building block” components that deliver system level functionality and design solutions our product portfolio decreased from approximately 30800 products in 2005 to approximately 28800 products in 2006 due to normal product pruning and end of life products and we shipped approximately 306 billion units in 2006 we specialize in micro packages which offer increased performance characteristics while reducing the critical board space inside today’s ever shrinking electronic devices we believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products provides our customers with single source purchasing on a costeffective and timely basis 

  

in may 2006 we announced a change in our organizational structure and have organized into five operating segments which also represent five reporting segments automotive and power regulation computing digital and consumer standard products and manufacturing services each of our major product lines has been assigned to a segment as illustrated in the table below based on our operating strategy because many products are sold into different end markets the total revenue reported for a segment does not completely align with actual sales in the end market associated with that segment but rather is the sum of the revenues from the product lines assigned to that segment our manufacturing services in which we manufacture parts for other semiconductor companies principally in our newly acquired gresham oregon facility are reported in the manufacturing services segment these segments represent our view of the business and as such are used to evaluate progress of our operations and of our major initiatives information related to periods prior to this change have been revised to conform to the current presentation in periods prior to the change these various product lines were aligned into two segments the analog products group and the integrated power group for required disclosures regarding our reportable segments see note 19 “segment information” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

   

we have approximately 133 direct customers worldwide and we also service approximately 202 significant original equipment manufacturers indirectly through our distributor and electronic manufacturing service provider customers our direct and indirect customers include 1 leading original equipment manufacturers in a broad variety of industries such as intel motorola nokia philips siemens and sony 2 electronic manufacturing service providers such as flextronics jabil and solectron and 3 global distributors such as arrow avnet ebv elektronik future solomon enterprise and world peace 

  

we currently have major design operations in arizona rhode island texas oregon china slovakia the czech republic korea and france and we currently operate manufacturing facilities in arizona oregon china the czech republic japan malaysia the philippines and slovakia we ceased manufacturing operations at our rhode island manufacturing facility in the second quarter of 2005 and exited the facility in the fourth quarter of 2005 in the fourth quarter of 2006 we sold the rhode island manufacturing facility for 32 million and recorded a gain of 06 million in the second quarter of 2005 we announced the transfer of wafer fabrication manufacturing operations from our frontend fabrication facility in malaysia to arizona due to the current increase in demand from our customers during the second quarter of 2006 we decided to keep the wafer fabrication portion of the malaysian site operating during the fourth quarter of 2006 we sold a portion of the phoenix site for 52 million and recorded a gain of 39 million the sale included a warehouse building and an unused parking lot we continue to market additional unused portions of our property at our corporate headquarters in arizona and plan to use some of the proceeds from the sale to upgrade portions of our corporate headquarters we will maintain our headquarters offices and existing manufacturing facilities on the portions of the property that are not for sale 

  

company history and capital structure 

  

formerly known as the semiconductor components group of the semiconductor products sector of motorola inc we were a whollyowned subsidiary of motorola prior to august 4 1999 we continue to hold through direct and indirect subsidiaries substantially all the assets and operations of the semiconductor components group of motorola’s semiconductor products sector on august 4 1999 we were recapitalized the “recapitalization” and certain related transactions were effected pursuant to an agreement among us our principal domestic operating subsidiary semiconductor components industries llc “sci llc” motorola and affiliates of texas pacific group “tpg” 

  

on april 3 2000 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of cherry semiconductor corporation for 2532 million in cash including acquisition related costs cherry semiconductor corporation which we have renamed semiconductor components industries of rhode island inc is a whollyowned subsidiary and designs and manufactures analog and mixed signal integrated circuits for the power management and automotive markets 

  

on may 3 2000 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock selling 345 million shares with an issue price of 16 per share net proceeds from the initial public offering after deducting issuance costs were approximately 5148 million the net proceeds were used to redeem all outstanding preferred stock including accrued dividends redeem a portion of the senior subordinated notes and prepay a portion of the loans outstanding under the senior bank facilities 

  

on september 7 2001 we obtained 1000 million 992 million net of issuance costs through an equity investment by an affiliate of tpg our principal shareholder in this transaction we issued 10000 shares of redeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock this investment was required because we were not in compliance with certain minimum interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants under our senior bank facilities in november 2005 we entered into a conversion and termination agreement with tpg to convert our redeemable convertible preferred stock into approximately 494 million shares of our common stock to induce the conversion we issued approximately 39 million additional shares of our common stock to tpg following the conversion none of the authorized shares of our preferred stock remained outstanding see 

  

note 10 “redeemable preferred stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in each case included elsewhere in this report 

  

on may 15 2006 we through our principal domestic operating subsidiary sci llc purchased lsi logic corporation’s “lsi” gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility including real property tangible personal property certain intangible assets other specified manufacturing equipment and related information the assets purchased include an approximately 83 acre campus with an estimated 500000 square feet of building space of which approximately 98000 square feet is clean room we hired substantially all of the manufacturing and engineering employees working at the gresham facility at the closing of the transaction we also entered into several ancillary agreements including but not limited to a wafer supply and test agreement intellectual property license agreement transition services agreement and facility use agreement the aggregate purchase price for the acquired assets was 1065 million which included 15 million in transaction related costs plus an additional 11 million of certain net assets and liabilities that were assumed by sci llc when the purchase was finalized on may 15 2006 the aggregate purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased based on their relative fair values see note 5 “asset acquisition” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion 

  

the purchase of the gresham wafer facility significantly enhances our internal manufacturing capabilities with the completion of this transaction we have acquired process development engineers operational expertise and process development knowhow to further enable us in developing a larger mix of high volume low cost highperformance submicron analog and digital power products down to the 018 micron level with toolset capabilities down to the 013 micron level 

  

as of december 31 2005 our principal stockholder tpg and its affiliates beneficially owned over 50 of our common stock during 2006 tpg sold approximately 697 million shares of our common stock including shares repurchased by us from tpg as of february 12 2007 tpg and its affiliates beneficially owned 504 million shares of our common stock representing approximately 174 of the total voting power of our common stock 

  

debt financings and cost savings initiatives 

  

since our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors during 2002 and 2003 we engaged in several debt refinancing transactions which extended a portion of our debt maturities some of the transactions that extended our debt maturities also resulted in an increase in our overall interest expense and others lowered our overall interest expense in connection with these transactions we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things make our financial covenants less restrictive on the whole 

  

since 2003 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt and related interest costs as a result of these measures we reduced our total debt from 13029 million as of december 31 2003 to 11760 million as of december 31 2006 we also reduced our interest expense from 1511 million for the year ended december 31 2003 to 518 million for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 8 “longterm debt” and note 11 “common stock and treasury stock” and note 2 “liquidity” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details on these financing activities that led to our reduced debt levels and annual interest expense 

  

since the fourth quarter of 2000 through 2005 we implemented profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and as a result we expect to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure 

  

we have initiated process improvements and selective low cost capital acquisitions that we expect will increase our overall capacity our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on 

  

   

   

   

   

   

return to profitability 

  

in the third quarter of 2004 we returned to profitability after 14 consecutive quarters of net losses we were also profitable during all four quarters of 2005 and during all four quarters of 2006 our net income for the year ended december 31 2006 was 2721 million and was the highest annual net income since our recapitalization in 1999 this return to profitability was the result of increased demand for our products and cost savings from profitability enhancement programs and restructuring programs as well as debt refinancing opportunities that have reduced our interest costs 

  

products and technology 

  

the following table provides information regarding our primary operating segments 

  

   

excluded from the table above are manufacturing services revenues of 1006 million 42 million and 70 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively which are primarily for foundry services 

  

automotive and power regulation group the explosion in consumer and computing devices is driving strong demand for highly efficient power supplies needed to charge and run them similarly the proliferation of electronic subsystems in automobiles the value of the electronic content now exceeds that of the metal in many cars has put tremendous stress on the existing 12 volt electrical backbone of automobiles power efficiency has become a critical issue as more and more electronic features are added we are a global supplier of power management analog products we have a complete power management portfolio in the six major product categories which include dcdc converters acdc converters linear regulators pulse width modulation pwm controllers power factor modulation pfm controllers power factor correction pfc preregulators and battery charging and management integrated circuits in the automotive space we are a global supplier of power management and protection devices including linear regulators and ignition insulated gate bipolar transistors igbt’s 

  

computing products group as computing platforms both desktop and portable evolve from dataprocessing systems database manipulation word processing and spreadsheets to signal processing systems audio video and wireless communications the core processors need to be more and more powerful more powerful processors in turn require more efficient power supplies and more efficient use of power on the motherboard and subsequent peripherals the computing products group is focused on delivering efficient controllers and power mosfets for power management in vcore ddr and chipsets for audio video and graphics processing subsystems we believe our success in these markets is attributable to our superior technology and manufacturing and supply chain capabilities which are needed to serve this highvolume market 

  

digital and consumer products group the focus of the digital and consumer products group is on cell phones and small portable electronic devices such as pdas mp3s and handheld gps digital portable devices such as cell phones pdas mp3s and handheld gps have become multifunctional devices incorporating many options including wireless communications audio video and camera functions the integration of functionality onto such small platforms puts a premium on being able to put highperformance devices into extremely small packages we have a broad portfolio of products and solutions that serve this space in industry leading micropackages the four application areas in which we have a significant position are system power management with fets and dcdc converters emi and rf filtering audio and video signal distribution with analog switches and op amps and led lighting solutions for lcd screens and camera flash 

  

standard products group as device size shrinks in portable and computing systems the threat from esd and power surges increases exponentially protection on inputoutput ports becomes a critical issue for designers both from a point of view of manufacturability and product robustness once it is in the hands of the consumer we offer a complete line of esd and zener tvs devices that provide a robust energyabsorptiontofootprint ratio our high frequency clock and data management products consist primarily of high margin emittercoupled logic ecl products we design and deliver applicationspecific integrated circuits using advanced technologies that address the highperformance needs of communication and networking switches highend servers highperformance work stations storage networks and precision measurement test systems we enable application specific designs for today’s advanced networks including asynchronous transfer mode atm enterprise networks storage area networks san and internet protocol ip applications 

  

customers 

  

we have been doing business with 43 of our 50 largest customers for more than five years sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but do not require minimum purchase commitments most of our original equipment manufacturer customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the 

  

calendar year while our other customers including electronic manufacturer service providers generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of end markets computing automotive electronics consumer electronics industrial electronics wireless communications and networking sales to our largest customers avnet arrow and motorola accounted for approximately 11 9 and 7 respectively of our revenues during 2006 as compared to 13 9 and 10 during 2005 and 12 9 and 8 in 2004 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of i three years from the date of shipment or ii the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog” below 

  

end market for our products 

  

the following table sets forth our principal enduser markets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each enduser market during 2006 sample applications for our products and representative original equipment manufacturer customers and end users 

  

   

   

original equipment manufacturers direct sales to original equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately 38 of our revenues in 2006 41 in 2005 and 42 in 2004 these customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as intel motorola nokia philips siemens and sony and in the automotive industry include daimlerchrysler delphi trw and visteon we focus on three types of original equipment manufacturers multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core original equipment manufacturer customers the target market customers in the communications power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are original equipment manufacturers that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

  

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 48 of our revenues in 2006 48 in 2005 and approximately 47 in 2004 our distributors which include arrow avnet ebv elektronik future solomon enterprise and world peace resell to midsized and smaller original equipment manufacturers and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book or that is more than four years older than the manufacturing code date in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 

  

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 14 of our revenues in 2006 and 11 of our revenues in each of 2005 and 2004 our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are flextronics jabil and solectron these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many original equipment manufacturers now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace

manufacturing operations 

  

we operate our manufacturing facilities either directly or through a joint ventures five of these facilities are frontend wafer sites located in japan slovakia the czech republic malaysia and the united states and three of such facilities are assembly and test sites located in china malaysia and the philippines in addition to these manufacturing and assembly operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 

  

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities the sizes of the locations represent the approximate gross square footage of each site’s building and include among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

  

   

we operate an assembly and test operations facility in leshan china this facility is owned by a joint venture company leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited “leshan” of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is a formerly stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 85 85 and 86 of leshan’s production capacity in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively and are currently committed to purchase approximately 81 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2007 in 2006 2005 and 2004 we incurred zero 02 million and 05 million in underutilization charges respectively as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan we supply die used in the production process 

  

the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations and we anticipate that any future expansion of our manufacturing capacity would involve this facility in june 2002 we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to 231 million in semiconductor operations which is in addition to the 278 million originally approved in 2004 we committed to make capital contributions of approximately 25 million to this joint venture by 2012 subject to market conditions we have the ability to time these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand 

  

in 2006 we acquired an additional interest in our investment in leshan for 92 million for which the incremental interest in the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets had an estimated fair value of 58 million resulting in 34 million of goodwill 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including ait ase kec magnachip phenitec and psi accounted for approximately 24 25 and 28 of our manufacturing costs in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

raw materials 

  

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a justintime basis and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table showing commitments contingencies and indemnities in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

sales marketing and distribution 

  

as of december 31 2006 our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 571 professionals operating out of approximately 30 offices which serve customers in 70 countries we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective internetbased applications support from our laboratories in the czech republic china and the united states through online connectivity applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all 

  

other regions since 2004 our cost structure related to freight shipping and logistical services has been improved as a result of our newest global distribution centers in the philippines and shanghai china which also resulted in improved domestic shipping and customs clearance operations we continue to monitor our freight and logistical support operations for potential cost savings 

  

patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights 

  

we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor ® and our on logo we own rights to a number of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property directly related to and important to our business in connection with our 1999 recapitalization motorola assigned licensed or sublicensed to us as the case may be certain intellectual property to support and continue the operation of our business as of january 10 2007 we had approximately 570 us and foreign patents and approximately 550 patent applications pending worldwide our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2007 to 2025 none of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business additionally we have rights to more than 240 registered and common law trademarks our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 

  

as part of the recapitalization motorola assigned to us approximately 295 us patents and patent applications approximately 292 foreign patents and patent applications rights to over 50 trademarks not including the motorola name previously used in connection with our products rights in knowhow relating to at least 39 semiconductor fabrication processes and rights in specified copyrightable materials in addition motorola licensed on a nonexclusive royaltyfree basis other patent trademark copyright and knowhow rights used in connection with our then existing products and products contemplated in our longrange plans we have perpetual royaltyfree worldwide rights under motorola’s patent portfolio and other intellectual property existing as of the date of our recapitalization or created in the five years thereafter the fiveyear period existing only with respect to patents as necessary to manufacture market and sell our then existing and long range plan product lines additionally motorola provided us with a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from certain infringement claims by third parties who had granted motorola licenses as of the date of our recapitalization which assisted us in developing our own patent position and licensing program through these arrangements we have the right to use all motorolaowned technology used in connection with the products we currently offer 

  

seasonality 

  

our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related end markets prior to 2005 we have typically experienced sales increases in the first two quarters of the year and relatively flat sales levels in the third and fourth quarters in 2005 and 2006 this pattern has shifted to more of a seasonally soft first half with a stronger second half as our products have increasingly become more consumer driven both 2005 and 2006 have exhibited this new pattern for our product sales 

  

backlog 

  

our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders or customer agreements that are booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demands from our electronic data interface customers in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times because we record revenues on a “sellthrough” basis backlog comprised of orders from distributors will not result in revenues until the distributors sell the products ordered during 2006 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 85 and 97 of actual revenues during such quarter as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases customers tend to order products further in advance and as a result backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 

  

in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 

  

we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 

  

competition 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for generalpurpose semiconductor products like ours is highly competitive although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products see part i item 1a “risk factors — trends risks and uncertainties related to other aspects of our business — competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs” elsewhere in this report 

  

we compete with respect to our four primary operating segments automotive and power regulation computing products digital and consumer products and standard products in the following manner 

  

automotive and power regulation 

  

the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation technical performance quality service and price our competitive strengths in this group are our strong technology and design resources our industry recognition in applications such as automotive and computing and our market share our significant competitors in this market include fairchild linear technology maxim national semiconductor st microelectronics and texas instruments several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions a competitive challenge in this group is our small market share with certain japanese automotive customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs if we are not identified as a vendor in the product design phase in most cases it is difficult to convince the manufacturer of the product to substitute our components during the production phase 

  

computing products 

  

the principal methods of competition in this group are technical performance total cost of solution ownership quality and assurance of supply our dualedge architecture for our microprocessor and ddr memory controllers give us a distinct costofownership advantage with no performance tradeoff and position us well to compete with incumbent suppliers that focus more on performance in addition the breadth of our portfolio in other support functions dcdc converters over voltage protection fets and analog give us the opportunity to serve multiple requirements and allow customers to control their vendor lists more easily our significant competitors in this market include analog devices international rectifier fairchild and infineon several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 

  

digital and consumer products 

  

the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation especially in packaging technical performance price quality and assurance of supply our competitive strengths in this group are our ability to put rf and emi filters and fets products in ever smaller packages without significantly degrading performance our significant competitors in this market include fairchild infineon international rectifier philips st microelectronics and vishay several of these competitors are larger in scale and size have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 

  

standard products 

  

our competitive strength in this area is the breadth of our portfolio our low cost structure and our supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation constantly introducing new packages and performance spins on existing products supplemented with new technology platforms as processes allow and price of particular importance are our over voltage protection portfolios esd protection tvs zeners and our clock management and distribution portfolios where we enjoy significant performance advantages over our competition our significant competitors in this market include fairchild international rectifier vishay national semiconductor maxim micrel idtics motorola and semtech 

  

research and development 

  

companysponsored research and development costs in 2006 2005 and 2004 were 1012 million 66 of revenue 937 million 74 of revenue and 944 million 75 of revenues respectively our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly we deploy people and capital with the goal to maximize our investment in research and development and to position us for continued growth as such we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity analog standard component mos power and clock and data management products we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 

  

government regulation 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 

  

our manufacturing facility in phoenix arizona is located on property that is a “superfund” site a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to cleanup activities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of onsite solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and offsite contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter 

  

manufacturing facilities in slovakia and the czech republic have ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that these facilities were operated by governmentowned entities in each matter these remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located onsite and offsite with additional action plans developed to respond in the event 

  

activity levels are exceeded at each of the respective locations the governments of the czech republic and slovakia have agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries subject to specified limitations for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination based upon the information available we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 

  

our design center in east greenwich rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination when we purchased the east greenwich facility we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property based on the information available we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

  

we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and liability for currently known environmental conditions to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects it is possible however that future developments including changes in laws and regulations government policies customer specification personnel and physical property conditions including currently undiscovered contamination could lead to material costs 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 11691 employees worldwide we do not currently have any collective bargaining arrangements with our employees except for those arrangements such as works councils that are obligatory for all employees or all employers in a particular industry under applicable foreign law of the total number of our employees as of december 31 2006 approximately 10209 were engaged in manufacturing and information services approximately 571 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization which includes customer service approximately 333 were engaged in administration and approximately 578 were engaged in research and development

trends risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition of the gresham oregon manufacturing facility 

  

we may experience difficulties utilizing the additional capacity of the gresham manufacturing facility in a costefficient manner 

  

after the expiration of our supply contract with lsi our ability to generate operating profits in gresham will depend upon our successful development of new products that can be produced using the technology of the gresham manufacturing facility failure to successfully integrate new products into the gresham manufacturing facility and failure to successfully market those new products could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 

  

in connection with the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility we entered into a supply contract with lsi which may result in operating losses at the facility 

  

during the first two years following the consummation of the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility we will rely on lsi as the sole customer under a supply contract to meet minimum guaranteed revenue commitments if we experience an increase in the cost of raw materials or lower than anticipated yields or if we are unable to meet the cycletime commitments called for by the contract we may experience losses from operations at the facility 

  

the transition costs associated with the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility may be greater than we anticipate 

  

in addition to the purchase price we expect to incur significant onetime costs in connection with the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility and the related integration of between 70 million and 120 million from 2006 to 2008 we also anticipate that the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility will increase our fixed costs by between 90 million and 100 million annually as a result while our revenues increased our gross margin percentage was negatively impacted in 2006 and we expect a similar impact in 2007 the costs and liabilities actually incurred in connection with the acquisition and subsequent integration process may exceed those anticipated although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the acquisition may offset additional expenses over time and result in net cost savings we cannot ensure that this net benefit will be achieved soon or at all 

  

the projections that we used in valuing the gresham manufacturing facility were based upon assumptions that we believed to be reasonable however these assumptions may prove to have been incomplete or inaccurate and our projections could differ materially from actual operating results 

  

if we fail to retain the highly skilled personnel currently employed at the gresham manufacturing facility our ability to successfully integrate the facility and realize the benefits of the acquisition could deteriorate 

  

the success of the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility depends upon our ability to retain the highly skilled technical managerial and operations personnel currently employed at the facility if we are unable to retain these employees we may be required to spend significant resources engaging employees with similar expertise or may be unable to secure such employees at all the loss of services of these employees could prevent us from introducing the high valueadded products that can be manufactured on the gresham manufacturing facility’s advanced technology platforms and might severely mitigate the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

  

we may experience difficulties in integrating and operating the gresham manufacturing facility 

  

our ability to achieve the benefits we anticipate from the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility will depend in large part upon whether we are able to integrate this facility into our business in an efficient and effective manner and once integrated operate the facility in this manner we may not be able to integrate this facility smoothly or successfully and the process may take longer than expected the integration of the manufacturing facility will require the dedication of significant management resources which may distract management’s attention from our daytoday business we may encounter similar and additional difficulties as we continue to operate the facility postintegration if we are unable to integrate and operate this facility successfully we may be unable to realize the cost savings revenue growth gross margin improvement earnings growth and other anticipated benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

trends risks and uncertainties related to other aspects of our business 

  

we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and operating losses in the future 

  

at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses although recently we have experienced some 

  

strength in our results reduced enduser demand price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business and we may experience declines in revenue and operating losses in the future in order to remain profitable we must continue to successfully implement our business plan including our cost reduction initiatives we also currently face an environment of uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our recent profitability 

  

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

  

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience such downturns in the future the most recent downturn which began in the fourth quarter of 2000 was severe and prolonged and it is uncertain whether recent improvements in semiconductor industry performance will continue or whether such improvements will benefit us to the same extent as they benefit other industry participants future downturns in the semiconductor industry may also be severe and prolonged future downturns in the semiconductor industry or any failure of the industry to fully recover from its recent downturn could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

during the 1990s and continuing into 2000 the semiconductor industry enjoyed unprecedented growth benefiting from the rapid expansion of the internet and other computing and communications technologies during 2001 we — like many of our customers and competitors — were adversely affected by a general economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the enduser products that incorporate our integrated circuits and standard semiconductors the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 also further depressed economic activity and demand for enduser products the impact of slowing endcustomer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of equipment and component inventories among our original equipment manufacturer subcontractor and distributor customers resulting in increasing pricing pressure we expect that factors including but not limited to economic uncertainty and downturns relating to the threat or actual occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks reduced demand for enduser products underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and changes in our revenue mix could adversely impact our operating results in the near term 

  

our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization 

  

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits as a percentage of total revenues gross profit was 385 for 2006 compared to 332 for 2005 and 324 for 2004 gross profit improved in 2006 2005 and 2004 in each case as a result of increased sales volume and cost savings from our profitability enhancement programs increased competition and other factors may lead to price erosion lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

  

the failure to implement as well as the completion and impact of our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 

  

between 2000 and the end of 2005 we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in response to the significant downturn in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead however we 

  

cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will in and of themselves continue to help us sustain our profitability 

  

we recorded net restructuring charges of 69 million in 2006 33 million in 2005 and 196 million in 2004 to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments as well as gains on the sale of assets and insurance recoveries the impact of these restructuring actions on our ability to compete effectively is subject to risks and uncertainties because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 

  

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

  

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 continue to aggressively manage maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 further expand our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 rationalize our manufacturing operations 7 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 8 reduce selling and administrative expenses 9 manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands 10 actively manage working capital 11 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 12 focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

  

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other things to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

  

we may require additional capital in the future and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 

  

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with the cash that we expect to generate from our operations and sales of assets in the ordinary course of business will be sufficient to meet our planned capital needs for the next 12 months however it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to fund our future activities or to consummate additional purchases of assets businesses products or technologies as of february 12 2007 we had 206 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility subject to the restrictions contained in our senior bank facilities we may be able to raise these funds by selling securities to the public or selected investors or by borrowing money we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available we may be required to curtail our 

  

operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development make selective dispositions of our assets or obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets or otherwise impair our ability to remain competitive 

  

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

  

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 

  

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

  

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty we routinely purchase inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

  

during various periods in 2006 2005 and 2004 short customer lead times prevailed given the overcapacity in the industry these and other factors adversely affected our revenues during these periods 

  

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

  

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for semiconductor components is highly competitive as a result of the recent economic downturn competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as 

  

manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness 

  

many of our competitors may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories and presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

  

because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases are integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 

  

we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends 

  

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

  

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

  

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other things capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

  

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing and information technology and equipment to remain competitive the failure inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

  

our capital expenditures were 1990 million in 2006 including the purchase of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility 461 million in 2005 and 818 million in 2004 we may be required to increase our future capital expenditures to meet increased demand 

  

semiconductor manufacturing has historically required a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more 

  

efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices we maintain certain of our own manufacturing assembly and test facilities which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 

  

we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency any such implementation however can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or in some instances to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned in the case of abandonment we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

  

we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing or information technology and equipment in addition our principal credit agreement limits the amount of our capital expenditures 

  

if we were to lose one of our large customers or if the existing downturn in the automotive market persists or deepens our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

  

product sales to our ten largest customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 51 55 and 54 for the years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

approximately 16 of our total revenues in 2006 were attributable to our various automotive customers certain of these automotive customers have been experiencing a downturn in their business in part due to labor difficulties on october 8 2005 delphi corporation one of our automotive customers and certain of its us subsidiaries commenced reorganization proceedings under chapter 11 of the us federal bankruptcy code during the quarter and nine months ended september 29 2006 revenues from delphi accounted for less than 3 of our total revenues and approximately 54 million of our receivables due from delphi as of september 29 2006 are subject to collection pending resolution of the reorganization proceedings there can be no assurance that other automotive customers will not encounter similar financial difficulties moreover we may have to change our revenue recognition practices from an accrual basis to a cash basis for these customers if the collection of accounts receivable from them is not reasonably assured which would have an adverse impact on our profitability 

  

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

  

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including silicon wafers copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

in addition for some of our products such as our silicon germanium sige technology we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods these contract manufacturers including ait ase kec magnachip phenitec and psi accounted for approximately 24 25 and 28 of our manufacturing costs in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations could be adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 

  

acquisitions and strategic alliances may harm our operating results or cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities or dilute our stockholders 

  

we may in the future acquire and form strategic alliances relating to other businesses products and technologies successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts the difficulties of integration and alignment may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations the complexity of the technologies being integrated and aligned and the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures the integration and alignment of operations following an acquisition or alliance requires the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the daytoday business and may disrupt key research and development marketing or sales efforts in addition we may issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results without strategic acquisitions and alliances we may have difficulty meeting future customer product and service requirements 

  

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

  

approximately 26 59 and 15 of our total revenues in 2006 approximately 24 60 and 16 of our total revenues in 2005 and approximately 28 56 and 16 of our total revenues in 2004 were derived from the americas the asiapacific region and europe including the middle east respectively we maintain significant operations in seremban malaysia carmona the philippines aizu japan leshan china roznov the czech republic and piestany the slovak republic in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

  

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive for example analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel as employee incentives we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time we have also issued restricted stock units with timebased vesting our stock price at times has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

  

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty patents or other intellectual property rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

  

we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 

  

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

  

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products which could in turn negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged intellectual property rights 

  

we are party to securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

  

in july 2001 three stockholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york “district court” against us certain of our former officers current and former directors and various investment banking firms who acted as underwriters in connection with our initial public 

  

offering in may 2000 in april 2002 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint that supercedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint generally alleges that our offering documents failed to disclose certain underwriting fees and commissions and underwriter tieins and other arrangements with certain customers of the underwriters that impacted the price of our common stock in the aftermarket the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages in july 2002 together with other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the class action lawsuit in february 2003 the district court dismissed claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws with prejudice however the district court denied the motion to dismiss claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws in addition the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of claims brought against the current and former directors and officers who were named as individual defendants in the litigation in june 2003 upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation 

  

consummation of the proposed settlement is conditioned upon obtaining final approval by the district court in april 2006 the district court took under advisement whether to grant final approval to the proposed settlement if this proposed settlement is ultimately approved by the district court it would result in a dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elect to participate in the proposed settlement together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants however in december 2006 the federal court of appeals for the second circuit “court of appeals” issued a decision that six purported class action lawsuits containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted against us may not be certified as class actions the impact if any of this ruling on the viability of the proposed settlement has not yet been determined in january 2007 the plaintiffs in the cases asked the court of appeals to reconsider its december 2006 decision that none of the cases could be certified as class actions this request for reconsideration is still pending the new york federal district court had earlier stayed all activity in the cases including further consideration of the proposed settlement until the court of appeals decides whether it is willing to reconsider its ruling 

  

we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this securities litigation including the proposed settlement any conclusion of this litigation in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition the cost to us of defending the litigation even if resolved in our favor could be substantial such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of this litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future 

  

we are subject to litigation risks 

  

all industries including the semiconductor industry are subject to legal claims with and without merit we are involved in a variety of routine legal matters that arise in the normal course of business these matters typically fall into the following broad categories those involving suppliers and customers employment and labor and intellectual property we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however defense and settlement costs can be substantial even with respect to claims that have no merit due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

  

we are spending a significant amount of management time and external resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of 

  

our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm we have completed this section 404 process for 2006 and in doing so we were required to hire additional personnel and use outside advisory services and as a result we incurred additional accounting and legal expenses we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2006 however if in the future our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as specified by applicable sec rules and regulations andor other applicable standards our ability to publish accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be jeopardized and our common stock price and our business could be affected in a material adverse manner 

  

we do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting and more broadly our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent andor detect all errors and all fraud although our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives a control procedure no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control procedure are met because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods has risks and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control because of their inherent limitations disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements further these sorts of controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within a company have been detected 

  

see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

  

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air water and ground our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other things regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 

  

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

  

   

   

   

   

terrorist attacks such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington dc on september 11 2001 or threats or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades the markets in which we operate and our profitability 

  

on september 11 2001 the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope the threat or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades the market in which we operate and our profitability the terrorist attacks have caused instability in the global financial markets and future or threatened terrorist attacks or occurrences of international armed conflict could result in greater economic instability 

  

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

  

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

  

we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 1989 million of senior indebtedness and 8390 million of senior subordinated indebtedness outstanding as of and for the year ended december 31 2006 we had total longterm indebtedness of 11760 million including current maturities but excluding unused commitments and interest expense of 518 million respectively also we may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments 

  

the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to you including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may incur more debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

  

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness but do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ current debt levels the related risks that we and they now face could intensify some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness 

  

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

  

our debt agreements contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our senior bank facilities require that we maintain or achieve a minimum consolidated ebitda as defined therein any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

  

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we 

  

were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

  

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness as of february 12 2007 we had 206 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

  

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has ranged from a high of 2775 on the nasdaq national market which is where our common stock was traded prior to the inception of the nasdaq global select market on may 1 2000 to a low of 089 on october 4 2002 the last reported price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market on february 12 2007 was 948 per share 

  

our stock price could be affected because a substantial number of shares of our common stock could be available for sale in the future 

  

sales in the public market of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could depress the market price of the common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities a substantial number of shares of our common stock could be available for future sale during 2006 tpg sold 697 million shares of our common stock of which 600 million shares were sold on the open market 

  

tpg as our principal stockholder may be able to limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters submitted for a vote of the stockholders 

  

as of february 12 2007 tpg and its affiliates beneficially owned 504 million shares of our common stock representing approximately 174 of the total voting power of our common stock in addition 4 persons serve on our board of directors as representatives of tpg as a result tpg through its affiliates is able to exercise substantial influence over 

  

   

   

   

in addition our certificate of incorporation provides that the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which relate to business combinations with interested stockholders do not apply to us 

  

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

 item 2 properties 

  

in the united states our corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing design center and research and development operations are located in approximately 145 million square feet of building space on property that we own in phoenix arizona we also lease properties around the world for use as sales offices design centers research and development labs warehouses logistic centers and trading offices the size andor location of these properties change from time to time based on business requirements we operate distribution centers which are leased or contracted through a third party in locations throughout asia europe and the americas we own our manufacturing facilities in the united states japan malaysia the philippines slovakia and the czech republic these facilities are primarily manufacturing operations but also include office utility laboratory warehouse and unused space our joint venture in leshan china also owns manufacturing warehouse laboratory office and unused space 

  

in december 2003 we announced our decision to phase out manufacturing operations at our facility in east greenwich rhode island we completed this closure during the fourth quarter of 2005 we transferred the production from this facility to our lower cost manufacturing facilities we completed the sale of the manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of 2006 we still own and occupy an approximately 58000 square foot design center in east greenwich rhode island 

  

in the second quarter of 2006 we purchased an approximately 500000 square foot manufacturing facility in gresham oregon this site is 83 acres and includes 98000 square feet of clean room 

  

as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola conveyed to us the surface rights to a portion of the land located at our phoenix facility excluding the subsurface rights and conveyed buildings located at the phoenix facility these buildings do not include any treatment facilities relating to motorola’s environmental cleanup 

  

operations at the phoenix facility we executed a declaration of covenants easements and restrictions with motorola providing access easements for the parties and granting to us options to purchase or to lease the subsurface rights of the land in 2005 we announced plans to sell unused portions of the phoenix arizona location in october 2006 we sold a portion of the phoenix arizona site that included an unused warehouse and unused parking lot we plan to sell approximately 20 additional acres of land and three buildings located on this land the property and buildings are currently being marketed for sale the remainder of the phoenix site will continue as our corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing design center and research and development facility 

  

we believe that our facilities around the world whether owned or leased are well maintained we believe that we have sufficient access to productive capacity to meet our needs for the majority of the products in our business lines for the foreseeable future 

  

we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and similar assets of each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries but no more than 65 of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries held by them to secure our senior bank facilities 

  

see part 1 item 1 “manufacturing operations” included elsewhere in this report for further details on our properties 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on information currently available management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters including the matters described in the next paragraphs will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  

securities class action litigation 

  

during the period july 5 2001 through july 27 2001 we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our former officers current and former directors and the underwriters for our initial public offering the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york as abrams v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv6114 breuer v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv6287 and cohen v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv6942 “district court” on april 19 2002 the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint alleges among other things that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters’ excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately 300 other publiclytraded companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city which have all been transferred along with the case against us to a single federal district judge for purposes of coordinated case management we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended and intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously the litigation process is inherently uncertain however and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us 

  

on july 15 2002 together with the other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them in addition the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual former officers and current and former directors who were named as defendants in our litigation and they are no longer parties to the litigation on february 19 2003 the district court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants in that ruling the district court granted in part and denied in part those motions as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws the district court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to replead these claims as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded the district court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well the district court also denied the underwriter defendants’ motion to dismiss in all respects 

  

in june 2003 upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation if ultimately approved by the district court this proposed settlement would result in the dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elect to participate in the proposed settlement together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants the proposed settlement does not provide for the resolution of any claims against the underwriter defendants and the litigation against those defendants is continuing the proposed settlement provides that the class members in the class action cases brought against the participating issuer defendants will be guaranteed a recovery of 10 billion by the participating issuer defendants if recoveries totaling less than 10 billion are obtained by the class members from the underwriter defendants the class members will be entitled to recover the difference between 10 billion and the aggregate amount of those recoveries from the participating issuer defendants if recoveries totaling 10 billion or more are obtained by the class members from the underwriter defendants however the monetary obligations to the class members under the proposed settlement will be satisfied in addition we and any other participating issuer defendants will be required to assign to the class members certain claims that we may have against the underwriters of our initial public offerings 

  

the proposed settlement contemplates that any amounts necessary to fund the settlement or settlementrelated expenses would come from participating issuers’ directors and officers’ liability insurance policy proceeds as opposed to funds of the participating issuer defendants themselves a participating issuer defendant could be required to contribute to the costs of the settlement if that issuer’s insurance coverage were insufficient to pay that issuer’s allocable share of the settlement costs we expect that our insurance proceeds will be sufficient for these purposes and that we will not otherwise be required to contribute to the proposed settlement 

  

consummation of the proposed settlement is conditioned upon obtaining approval by the district court on september 1 2005 the district court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement and directed that notice of the terms of the proposed settlement be provided to class members thereafter the district court held a fairness hearing on april 24 2006 at which objections to the proposed settlement were heard after the fairness hearing the district court took under advisement whether to grant final approval to the proposed settlement 

  

on december 5 2006 the us court of appeals for the second circuit “court of appeals” issued a decision in in re initial public offering securities litigation that six purported class action lawsuits containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted against the company may not be certified as class actions due in part to the court of appeals’ determination that individual issues of reliance and knowledge would predominate over issues common to the proposed classes on january 8 2007 the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking rehearing en banc of the court of appeals’ december 5 2006 ruling us district judge scheindlin has ordered that all proceedings in the consolidated cases brought against the company and against the roughly 300 other issuers sued in substantially similar cases including proceedings relating to the proposed settlement will be stayed pending the ruling by the court of appeals on whether to entertain that petition for rehearing as a result in part of that filing the impact if any of the court of appeals’ ruling on the viability of the proposed settlement cannot yet be determined 

  

if the proposed settlement described above is not consummated we intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously while we can make no promises or guarantees as to the outcome of these proceedings we believe that the final result of these actions will have no material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

other matters 

  

on september 30 2005 we entered into a settlement agreement with one of our customers and one of that customer’s customers resolving a potential claim against us for costs incurred in remedying certain alleged failures of products purchased directly or indirectly from us the potential claim which was estimated by our customer to aggregate approximately 312 million under the settlement agreement we agreed to pay our customer’s customer 25 million in cash and each party agreed to bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the claim at the same time we entered into separate agreements with our customer in part as a result of the claim and in part in an effort to increase our business with the customer pursuant to which we agreed to i provide certain rebates to the customer for products and services purchased from us by them for a period of five years beginning october 1 2005 and ii rebate not less than 25 million in cash regardless of actual purchases no later than september 25 2006 the amounts were considered to be warranty claims resulting in a warranty expense of 50 million during the year ended december 31 2005

executive overview 

  

this section presents summary information regarding our industry markets and operating trends only for further information regarding the events summarized herein you should read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in its entirety 

  

industry overview 

  

worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 2477 billion in 2006 an increase of 89 from 2275 billion in 2005 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by the world semiconductor trade statistics “wsts” group to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market since 2002 

  

     

following the unprecedented semiconductor industry revenue declines of 2001 the semiconductor industry began to show signs of stability in 2002 and grew more robust in both 2003 and 2004 worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by 280 in 2004 68 in 2005 and 89 in 2006 sales in our total addressable market grew by 142 in 2004 and 144 in 2003 reflecting increases in volume and slowing rates of price declines sales in our total addressable market remained stable in 2005 reflecting increases in volume that were offset by 

  

price declines sales in our total addressable market grew in 2006 reflecting increases in volume that exceeded the impact of further price declines the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately 66 during 2007 through 2009 these are projections and may not be indicative of actual results 

  

recent results 

  

our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 were 15318 million an increase of 215 percent from 12606 million for the year ended december 31 2005 during 2006 we reported net income of 2721 million that included a restructuring asset impairment and other benefit of 69 million during 2005 we reported net income of 1006 million that included 33 million in restructuring asset impairments and other charges our gross margin increased by approximately 530 basis points to 385 percent in 2006 from 332 percent in 2005 for the year we achieved the highest gross margin net income and earnings per fully diluted share in our history during the last quarter of 2006 we executed a series of financial transactions enabling us to reduce the overall cost of our debt and to repurchase approximately 12 percent of our then outstanding shares of common stock 

  

outlook 

  

based upon booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we anticipate that total revenues will be approximately 3680 to 3780 million in the first quarter of 2007 as compared to revenues of 3340 million in the first quarter of 2006 and revenues of 4016 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 we expect that approximately 250 million of our total revenues will come from manufacturing service revenues during the first quarter of 2007 backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of 2007 were down slightly from backlog levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2006 and represented over 90 percent of our anticipated first quarter 2007 revenues we expect average selling prices will be down approximately two percent in the first quarter of 2007 we expect our gross margins on product revenues will be approximately 39 in the first quarter of 2007 and we expect our gross margins on manufacturing services revenue to be approximately breakeven in the first quarter of 2007 beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we were required to expense stock based compensation in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “share based payment” we currently expect this expense to be approximately 30 to 40 million in the first quarter of 2007 due to the volatility of the price of our common stock and the uncertainty of future option grants to employees we are unable to estimate this expense for periods subsequent to the first quarter of 2007 

  

for the first quarter of 2007 we expect selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses at approximately 12 to 13 of revenues and research and development expenses at approximately 7 of revenues we anticipate that net interest expense and income tax provision will be approximately 75 million and 30 million respectively for the first quarter of 2007 we expect fully diluted common shares outstanding to be approximately 295 million in the first quarter of 2007 based on a stock price of 850 we anticipate cash capital expenditures will be approximately 55 million in the first quarter of 2007 

  

business overview 

  

we classify our products broadly as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components we design manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products our power management semiconductor components control convert protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our data management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all electronic devices these various products fall into the logic analog and discrete categories used by wsts 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand have reached levels above capacity production capabilities shortages have begun to occur which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

  

during the first half of 2006 we experienced improvements in pricing for our products while end market demand showed signs of moderation during the second half of 2006 we experienced stable to slightly declining prices for our products as end market demand showed signs of moderation we experienced a slight decline in bookings during the second half of 2006 with the book to bill ratio below one we expect price declines during 2007 to be moderate and we will continue to monitor the supply and demand picture to determine if pricing could be held or increased 

  

new product innovation 

  

as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives excluding the introduction of leadfree products we introduced 158 new product families in 2006 133 new product families in 2005 and 119 new product families in 2004 our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications in light of the recent acquisition of the gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility we are increasing our research and development in deep sub micron power management solutions to further differentiate us from our competition as always it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position us for continued growth as a result we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity logic analog and discrete products we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 

  

debt reduction and financing activities 

  

since our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors in the second half of 2003 and continuing through 2006 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt and related interest costs we reduced both our total debt and interest expense as a result of our public offerings of common stock in september 2003 and february 2004 a portion of the proceeds from which we applied to prepay and redeem a portion of our outstanding debt prior to scheduled maturity we also lowered our interest expense further as a result of the issuance of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of our senior bank facilities the proceeds from which were used to repay higher interest notes 

  

in the second half of 2005 we continued these measures to reduce our interest costs by issuing 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes and using the proceeds from the issuance along with cash on hand to repay our junior subordinated note which carried a significantly higher interest rate than the convertible senior subordinated notes in november 2005 our outstanding series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock beneficially owned by an affiliate of the tpg was converted into common stock which eliminated the accrual of preferred stock dividends additionally in december 2005 and also in january 2006 we refinanced the term loans under our senior bank facilities to reduce the interest rate on the senior bank facilities 

  

in april 2006 we completed a public offering of 112 million shares which includes 07 million shares issued as overallotments of our common stock issued approximately at a price of 700 per share the net 

  

proceeds of 761 million from this offering were used to partially fund the purchase of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility which had a total purchase price of 1050 million 

  

in july 2006 we completed an offer to exchange substantially all of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 for new notes with similar terms but with a net share settlement feature 

  

in the third quarter of 2006 we refinanced our debt with two chinese banks to reduce our interest costs and to extend maturity dates we also entered into 110 million of new debt with these banks 

  

in december 2006 we issued 4840 million of 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 with terms similar to the zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 and the 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 we repaid a significant portion of our senior bank facilities and also purchased 404 million shares of our common stock which included 97 million shares from tpg using the proceeds from the issuance of the 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 along with cash on hand 

  

as a result of these debt prepayments and refinancings we reduced our total longterm debt balance including the current portion from 13029 million as of december 31 2003 to 11760 million as of december 31 2006 we also reduced our interest expense from 1511 million for the year ended december 31 2003 to 518 million for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

the details of each of these financing events are outlined in the following sections also see “liquidity and capital resources” elsewhere in this report and note 8 “longterm debt” note 10 “redeemable preferred stock” and note 11 “common stock and treasury stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 the amounts in the following table are in millions 

  

   

revenues 

  

net revenues were 15318 million 12606 million and 12669 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to increased product volume and manufacturing services revenue resulting from the acquisition of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 5 the slight decrease in net revenues from 2005 to 2004 was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 6 partially offset by increased sales volume the revenues by reportable segment in each of these three years were as follows dollars in millions 

  

    

revenues from automotive and power regulation increased from 2005 to 2006 and from 2004 to 2005 in 2006 the increase can be attributed to an increase in revenues from ldo rectifier and vregs products partially offset by a decrease in revenues from acdc and automotive products in 2005 the increase can be attributed to an increase in revenues from analog automotive and acdc conversion products partially offset by a decrease in revenues from ldo and vregs products 

  

revenues from computing products increased from 2005 to 2006 and decreased from 2004 to 2005 the increase from 2005 to 2006 is primarily due to increases in revenues from low and medium voltage mosfet signal and interface and power switching products the decrease from 2004 to 2005 can be primarily attributed to a decrease in revenue from low and medium voltage mosfet products partially offset by an increase in revenues from signal and interface products 

  

revenues from digital and consumer products increased from 2005 to 2006 and also from 2004 to 2005 the increase from 2005 to 2006 is primarily due to increase revenues from analog switches low voltage filters and standard logic products partially offset by decreased revenues from application specific power products the increase in 2005 can be attributed to increased revenues from standard logic products partially offset by decreased revenues from low voltage products 

  

revenues from standard products increased from 2005 to 2006 and decreased from 2004 to 2005 this segment consists of many products that are available from numerous competitors in the marketplace and is thus heavily influenced by pricing pressures and general market conditions the increase in revenues from 2005 to 2006 is largely attributed to increased revenues from protection products partially offset by decreases in standard logic products the decrease in revenue from 2004 to 2005 can be primarily attributed to a decrease in revenues from high frequency and protection products partially offset by an increase in revenue from zener and small signal products 

  

additionally revenue growth in manufacturing services is due to the manufacturing services revenue from the wafer supply agreement with lsi that began in 2006 related to our purchase of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility 

  

revenues by geographic area as a percentage of revenues were as follows 

  

   

a majority of our end customers served directly or through distribution channels are manufacturers of electronic devices in recent years there has been a trend toward moving such manufacturing activities to lower cost regions particularly in asia our shift in revenues by geographic area reflects this trend 

  

for the year ended december 31 2006 two of our customers accounted for 11 and 9 of our net revenues respectively excluding manufacturing revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 two of our customers accounted for 13 and 10 of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 two of our customers accounted for 12 and 9 of our net revenues 

  

approximately 16 19 and 19 of our revenues for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively are attributable to its various automotive customers certain of these automotive customers have been experiencing a downturn in their business in part due to labor difficulties on october 8 2005 delphi corporation “delphi” one of our automotive customers and certain of delphi’s us subsidiaries commenced reorganization proceedings under chapter 11 of the us federal bankruptcy code during the year ended december 31 2006 our revenues from delphi accounted for less than 3 of our total revenues and approximately 54 million of our receivables due from delphi as of december 31 2006 are subject to collection pending resolution of the reorganization proceedings subsequent to december 31 2006 we sold our receivables due from delphi that are subject to collection pending resolution of the reorganization proceedings to a third party with recourse to us 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 5890 million 4185 million and 4099 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively as a percentage of revenues our gross profit was 385 332 and 324 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively gross profit increased during 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to increased sales volume increased manufacturing service revenue from our gresham oregon wafer fabrication and a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately 202 million resulting from a change in our estimate of the useful life of our machinery and equipment assets partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices see note 4 “accounting changes” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k gross profit increased during 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to cost savings from our profitability enhancement programs and increased sales volume which were partially offset by declines in average selling prices gross profit for the year ended december 31 2004 is not included as it would be impractical to do so because manufacturing costs were not systematically tracked by device in 2004 therefore data does not exist to reconstruct gross profit under the new segment structure the gross profit by reportable segment in each of these two years were as follows dollars in millions 

  

   

gross profit from automotive and power regulation increased from 2005 to 2006 the increase can be attributed to increases in gross profit from ldo dcdc conversion and rectifier products partially offset by decreases in analog automotive and acdc conversion products 

  

gross profit from computing products increased from 2005 to 2006 the increase can be attributed to increases in gross profit from low and medium voltage mosfet power switching and signal and interface products 

  

gross profit from digital and consumer products increased from 2005 to 2006 the increase can be attributed to increases in gross profit from analog switches filtes low voltage and standard logic products partially offset by decreases in application specific power products 

  

gross profit from standard products increased from 2005 to 2006 the increase can be attributed to increases in gross profit from protection zener small signal standard logic and thyristor products partially offset by decreases in high frequency products 

  

gross profit from manufacturing services increased due to the added value from the purchase of lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility in 2006 

  

certain costs incurred during the manufacturing process are not allocated to the reportable segments the decrease in unallocated manufacturing costs from 518 million in 2005 to 312 million in 2006 was due primarily to manufacturing costs we continued to incur at the east greenwich rhode island manufacturing facility in 2005 beyond the original anticipated closure date of that facility which were not allocated to the reportable segments similar costs were not incurred during 2006 due to the completion of the closure in 2005

research and development expenses were 1012 million 937 million and 944 million representing 66 74 and 75 of revenues in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase from 2005 to 2006 was primarily attributed to increased employee salaries and wages stock compensation expense and employee performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals partially offset by decreases in depreciation the decrease from 2004 to 2005 was primarily attributable to the absence of software application costs which occurred in 2004 partially offset by increased employee salaries and wages and increased headcount as well as an increase in performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals 

  

selling and marketing expenses were 910 million 793 million and 738 million representing 59 63 and 58 of revenues in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase from 2005 to 2006 was primarily attributed to increases in employee performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals increased employee salaries and wages increased head count which include management and field application engineers and stock compensation expense the increases from 2004 to 2005 were attributable to increased employee salaries and wages and increased headcount of our internal sales and marketing personnel which include management positions and field application engineers as well as an increase in employee performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals and increased commissions we plan to make investments in our sales and marketing systems to identify new customers as well as to expand our penetration of existing customers in selected product areas 

  

general and administrative expenses were 867 million 746 million and 722 million representing 57 59 and 57 of revenues in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase from 2005 to 2006 was attributable to increases in stock compensation expense employee performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals increase in salaries and wages associated with higher head count and legal expenses the increase from 2004 to 2005 was attributable to increased costs for external services including audit and consulting services and an increase in employee performance bonuses associated with our achievement of certain financial results partially offset by savings from personnel reductions functional relocations and lower depreciation 

  

other operating expenses — restructuring asset impairments and other 

  

restructuring asset impairments and other charges were 69 million 33 million and 196 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively our individual quarterly restructuring charges are summarized below for more information see note 6 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

operating income 

  

operating income for the year ended december 31 2004 is not included as it would be impractical to do so because operating expenses were not systematically tracked by device in 2004 therefore data does not exist to reconstruct operating income under the new segment structure information about operating income from our reportable segments for the year ended december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 are as follows in millions 

  

   

depreciation and amortization expense is included in segment operating income reconciliations of segment information to financial statements follows in millions 

  

   

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 518 million 615 million and 1012 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in interest expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily a result of interest savings that resulted from the repayment of 10 junior subordinated note that occurred during the second half of 2005 which was partially financed with the proceeds from the issuance of the 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 the decrease in interest expense from 2004 to 2005 was primarily a result of interest savings during the entire year of 2005 that resulted from the refinancings that had occurred during 2004 our weightedaverage interest rate on longterm debt including current maturities was 49 54 and 86 per annum in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources — key financing events” for a description of our refinancing activities 

  

loss on debt prepayment 

  

loss on debt prepayment totaled 13 million and 1597 million in 2006 and 2004 respectively during the fourth quarter of 2006 we used proceeds from the 4840 million converts and cash on hand to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities accordingly the 13 million loss on debt prepayment resulted from the write off a portion of debt issuance costs associated with the senior bank facilities the loss on debt prepayment of 1597 million in 2004 includes approximately 1136 million incurred for call and consent fees tender offer fees dealer manager fees and arrangement fees as well as approximately 457 million of debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts that were written off and 04 million of certain thirdparty costs incurred these costs were incurred in 2004 in connection with the repayment of the firstlien senior secured notes secondlien senior secured notes the senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of the senior bank facilities see “liquidity and capital resources — key financing events” for a description of our refinancing activities 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

provision for income taxes was 09 million 15 million and 74 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

the 2006 provision included 64 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 19 million of new reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions partially offset by the reversal of 74 million of previously accrued income taxes for anticipated audit issues 

  

the 2005 provision included 61 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 76 million of new reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions partially offset by the reversal of 95 million of previously accrued income taxes for anticipated audit issues and the reversal of a 27 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for one of our japanese subsidiaries that returned to profitability 

  

the 2004 provision related primarily to income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and also included the reversal of 112 million of previously accrued income taxes after the completion of an examination of our income tax returns for the years 2001 2000 and 1999 by the internal revenue service which resulted in no material change in our tax liability for those years this was offset by a new reserve of 99 million against certain foreign income tax receivables that we determined may not be collectible creating additional tax expense for the year 

  

cumulative effect of accounting change 

  

cumulative effect of accounting change net of income taxes was 29 million in 2005 

  

in 2005 we recorded a 29 million charge net of taxes of 03 million upon adoption of fin 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” “fin 47” which requires recognition of liabilities for legal obligations to perform asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity see “accounting changes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fin 47 

  

reportable segments 

  

segment information for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 under our prior segment structure including reconciliations of segment information to the consolidated financial statement amounts were as follows in millions 

  

   

   

liquidity and capital resources 

  

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements our sources and uses of cash our debt and debt covenants and our management of cash 

  

cash requirements 

  

commercial commitments contractual obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and indemnities 

  

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt operating leases pension obligations and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

  

     

our longterm debt includes 1989 million under senior bank facilities 2600 million of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 950 million under our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 4840 million under our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 124 million under a note payable to a japanese bank 546 million under loan facilities with chinese banks and 711 million of capital lease obligations see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

in the normal course of our business we enter into various operating leases for equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

  

our other longterm contractual obligations consist of estimated payments to fund liabilities that have been accrued in our consolidated balance sheet for our foreign pension plans see note 13 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report the us pension plan named the on semiconductor grandfathered pension plan “grandfathered plan” has been terminated effective december 31 2004 as approved by the pension benefit guaranty corporation in 2005 and such 

  

termination was determined by the internal revenue service not to adversely affect its qualification for federal tax purposes in connection with the termination of our grandfathered plan all cash funding requirements for the liability have been settled and the related plan assets have been distributed as of december 31 2005 the remaining obligation in the table above includes estimated funding requirements for liabilities related to our foreign pension plans 

  

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 2688 million at december 31 2006 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs over the next 12 months our senior bank facilities include a 250 million revolving facility letters of credit totaling 44 million were outstanding under the revolving facility at december 31 2006 we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than 25 million 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to intellectual property infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

  

we are a party to various agreements with motorola a former affiliate which were entered into in connection with our separation from motorola pursuant to these agreements we have agreed to indemnify motorola for losses due to for example breach of representations and warranties and covenants damages arising from assumed liabilities or relating to allocated assets and for specified environmental matters our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and payment by us is conditioned on motorola making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract which procedures typically allow us to challenge motorola’s claims 

  

in connection with the acquisition of the lsi’s gresham oregon wafer fabrication facility we entered into various agreements with lsi pursuant to certain of these agreements we agreed to indemnify lsi for certain things limited in the most instances by time andor monetary amounts 

  

we provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

  

in addition to the above from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 

  

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for possible contingencies related to legal matters and see part i item 1 “business — government regulation” of this report for information on certain environmental matters 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand and targeted asset sales additionally as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 

  

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

  

   

   

our ability to service our longterm debt to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may beyond our control 

  

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through december 31 2007 to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

  

operations 

  

our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash and our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities each of these components is discussed herein 

  

ebitda 

  

earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” is a key indicator that management uses to evaluate our operating performance and cash flows while ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity we believe this measure is useful to investors to assess our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditure and working capital requirements this calculation may differ in method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies the following table sets forth our ebitda for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

  

with a reconciliation to cash flows from operations the most directly comparable financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles in millions 

  

   

as a result of the improved operating performance we generated positive ebitda for 2004 2005 and 2006 ebitda for 2005 increased to 2571 million largely due to the generation of net income of 1006 million for the year ebitda for 2006 increased to 3944 million largely due to the generation of net income of 2721 million for the year 

  

as discussed in note 8 “longterm debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report our debt covenants require us to maintain a trailing 12month minimum adjusted ebitda of 1400 million adjusted ebitda as defined under the documents for our senior bank facilities totaled approximately 4383 million for the 12 months ended december 31 2006 this adjusted ebitda computation excludes certain restructuring and other charges and contains other differences from the ebitda as defined above therefore ebitda in the above table is not representative of the adjusted ebitda used to determine our debt covenant compliance 

  

if we were not in compliance with the covenants contained in our senior bank facilities including the adjusted ebitda maintenance covenant the holders of our senior bank facilities could cause all outstanding amounts to be due and payable immediately if we were unable to repay refinance or restructure that indebtedness the holders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any such event of default or declaration of acceleration could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

working capital 

  

working capital fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs our working capital including cash was 2678 million at december 31 2006 and has fluctuated between 2020 million and 3158 million over the last eight quarterends 

  

the components of our working capital at december 31 2006 and 2005 are set forth below in millions followed by explanations for changes between 2005 and 2006 for cash cash equivalents and any other changes greater than 5 million 

  

   

the increase in cash and cash equivalents of 355 million in 2006 was attributable to cash flow from operations of approximately 3498 million partially offset by cash used in investing activities of 1302 million and cash used in financing activities of 1845 million primarily for debt repayments see “key financing events” below 

  

the increase of 177 million in accounts receivable is the result of increased sales in the last two months of the fourth quarter of 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005 

  

the increase of 432 million in inventory is attributable to inventory produced at our gresham wafer fabrication facility acquired in 2006 and increased production ahead of expected demand increases 

  

the increase of 284 million in accounts payable was mainly a result of the timing of payments at the respective year ends and an increase in fixed asset additions during the fourth quarter of 2006 that remained unpaid as of december 31 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 

  

the increase in accrued expenses of 278 million was primarily attributable to the increase in accrued employee performance bonuses accrued payroll and accrued vacation 

  

the increase in deferred income is attributable to increase inventory levels and gross margin improvements at distributors as compared to december 31 2005 inventories at distributors were up from 98 weeks as of december 31 2005 to 114 weeks at december 31 2006 

  

the decrease in current portion of long term debt relates to the timing of payments under our debt instruments and changes in current debt under the free cash flow provision of our senior bank facilities approximately 259 million of the 2005 balance was reclassified to long term in 2006 as the lenders waived the prepayment obligation see note 8 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

longterm assets and liabilities 

  

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets foreign tax receivables and capitalized debt issuance costs 

  

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties capital expenditures were 1990 million 461 million and 818 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively we will continue to look for opportunities to make similar strategic purchases in the future as we plan to invest in 2007 for additional capacity although our debt covenants contain certain restrictions that limit our amount of future capital expenditures we do not believe that these restrictions will have a significant impact on our future operating performance 

  

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans generally our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions see note 13 “employee benefit plans” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our tax reserves see note 9 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

key financing events 

  

overview 

  

set forth below is a summary of the key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years 

  

since we became an independent company as a result of our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors our longterm debt includes significant amounts outstanding under our senior bank facilities which contain an ebitda as defined for such facilities maintenance covenant with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2006 

  

during the second half of 2003 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt reduce related interest costs and in some cases extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility these measures continued into 2005 and 2006 as described below 

  

february 2004 public offering of common stock and amendment to senior bank facilities 

  

on february 9 2004 we and our principal stockholder tpg completed a public offering of common stock pursuant to which we issued approximately 344 million shares at a public offering price of 698 per share the net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately 2279 million after deducting the underwriters’ 

  

discount of 108 million 03141 per share and estimated offering expenses of 22 million and 03 million of bank amendment we used a portion of the net proceeds received by us to redeem 700 million outstanding principal amount of our firstlien senior secured notes and 1050 million outstanding principal amount of our secondlien senior secured notes in each case on march 10 2004 at a redemption price of 1120 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed together with accrued interest to the redemption date we used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes in connection with this redemption we wrote off approximately 120 million of debt issuance costs we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by tpg 

  

in connection with the offering we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things

on april 22 2004 we refinanced 3205 million of loans under our senior bank facilities we replaced our tranche e term loan facility with a new tranche f term loan facility which bore interest at a base rate plus a margin that is 050 per annum lower than the comparable margin borne by the tranche e term loan facility principal repayments of the new tranche f term loan facility were to be due throughout 2008 and 2009 provided that if we had not redeemed or repurchased our secondlien senior secured notes in full on or prior to november 15 2007 the tranche f term loan facility would mature on november 15 2007 additionally in connection with this repricing the senior bank facilities were amended to among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

december 2004 amendment to senior bank facilities and repurchase of senior secured notes 

  

in december 2004 we refinanced the term loan portion of our senior bank facilities and increased our total borrowings under these facilities to 6455 million we replaced 3205 million of the tranche f term loan facility with 6455 million of a tranche g term loan facility with terms other than the interest rate and principal balance that are largely identical to those of the tranche f term loan facility proceeds from the tranche g term loan facility were used to acquire 1300 million principal outstanding of our firstlien senior secured notes due 2010 and 1950 million principal outstanding of our secondlien senior secured notes due 2008 principal payments under the tranche g term loan facility are paid quarterly at an annualized rate of 1 of the original principal balance with the remaining principal due at maturity the term loan portion of our credit facility expires december 15 2009 however if the first date on which holders of at least 2100 million in aggregate principal amount of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 is extended currently april 15 2010 the term loan will mature on the date which is six months prior to the first date on which holders may exercise such “put” rights in no event can the maturity date of the term loan be extended beyond december 15 2011 we also increased the interest rate on our term loans by 025 per annum costs incurred in connection with this refinancing totaled 24 million of which 19 million were expensed as incurred while the remaining 05 million of such costs were capitalized and are being amortized using the effective interest method 

  

as discussed above in december 2004 we used proceeds from the refinancing of our senior bank facilities to repurchase and retire all of our outstanding firstlien senior secured notes at a redemption price of 1235 of the principal amount of the notes that were redeemed and secondlien senior secured notes at a redemption price of 1188 also in connection with this debt repurchase we wrote off 87 million of unamortized debt discounts 109 million of debt issuance costs and expensed 02 million of thirdparty expenses in connection therewith 

  

covenant revisions in the fourth quarter of 2004 

  

after meeting certain financial conditions during the fourth quarter of 2004 certain financial covenants were revised in our senior bank facilities to

on november 10 2005 we entered into a conversion and termination agreement with an affiliate of tpg to convert our outstanding convertible redeemable preferred stock held by such affiliate with a book value of 1387 million and 1311 million as of september 30 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively into 49364080 shares of our common stock we issued an additional 3949126 shares of common stock to the tpg affiliate to induce the conversion of the preferred stock following the conversion none of the authorized shares of the preferred stock remained outstanding in connection with the conversion and inducement we recognized a 204 million charge that reduced net income applicable to common stock for a deemed dividend from the issuance of inducement shares issued upon conversion 

  

december 2005 repayment of 10 junior subordinated notes and issuance of 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes 

  

as part of the recapitalization semiconductor components industries llc our primary domestic operating subsidiary issued a 910 million junior subordinated note due 2011 during periods it was outstanding the note bore interest at an annual rate of 100 compounded semiannually and payable at maturity the note was junior in right of payment to all senior debt in november 2005 we repaid 664 million of the junior subordinated note with cash on hand which reduced the outstanding principal amount to approximately 910 million 

  

in order to finance the repayment of the remaining principal amount of the junior subordinated note in december 2005 we issued 950 million of 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 we received net proceeds of approximately 910 million from the sale of the notes after deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses of 40 million which were capitalized as debt issuance costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method through the first put date of december 15 2012 the notes bear interest at the rate of 1875 per year from the date of issuance interest on the notes is payable on june 15 and december 15 of each year beginning on june 15 2006 the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries

debt instruments guarantees and related covenants 

  

the following table presents the components of longterm debt as of december 31 2006 and 2005 dollars in millions 

  

   

we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and similar assets of each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries but no more than 65 of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries held by them to secure our senior bank facilities 

  

semiconductor components industries llc the primary domestic operating subsidiary of on semiconductor corporation is the borrower under our senior bank facilities on semiconductor corporation and our other domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee on a joint and several basis the obligations of the borrower under such facilities on semiconductor corporation is the issuer and sci llc is a guarantor of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 and our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 our other domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee on a joint and several basis the obligations of the issuers of such notes none of our nonus subsidiaries guarantee the senior bank facilities or the notes 

  

as of december 31 2006 we were in compliance with the various covenants and other requirements contained in the credit agreement relating to our senior bank facilities and the indentures relating to our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 and our 2625 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2026 we believe that we will be able to comply with the various covenants and other requirements contained in such credit agreement and the indentures through december 31 2007 

  

the credit agreement relating to our senior bank facilities includes a provision requiring an annual calculation of cash flow as defined and the application of a portion of that cash flow as a prepayment of loans outstanding under the agreement included in the current portion of longterm debt as of december 31 2005 was approximately 260 million of which 259 million was reclassified to long term as the lenders elected not to receive the prepayment 

  

our debt agreements contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our senior bank facilities require that we maintain or achieve a minimum consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined therein any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

cash management 

  

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

  

accounting changes 

  

asset retirement obligations  

  

effective december 31 2005 we adopted fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” “fin 47” fin 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” “statement 143” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity fin 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a result of the adoption of fin 47 we recorded a 29 net charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change in 2005 and we recorded a 40 million liability for asset retirement obligations included in other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

stock compensation expense  

  

see note 12 “employee stock benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for the effects of the adoption of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” 

  

funded status of employee benefit plans 

  

see note 13 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for the effects of the adoption of sfas no 158 “employer’s accounting for defined benefit pension and other retirement plans” 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america note 3 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contains a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

revenue we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers when title passes to the customer net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that they have resold the products to the end user although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

  

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products our actual returns and allowances do not fluctuate significantly from period to period and our returns and allowances provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 

  

freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense during the period in which they are incurred 

  

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand projected end user demand is generally based on sales during the prior 12 months these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2001 a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets additionally throughout 2004 2005 and 2006 no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized as of december 31 2006 and 2005 gross deferred tax assets were 6679 million and 6754 million respectively and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was 6650 million and 6692 million respectively despite recent net profits on a consolidated basis the deferred tax asset valuation allowance has not been released to income due to continued losses in our domestic jurisdictions our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 

  

impairment of longlived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value when material these gains are recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

  

goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary to date our goodwill has not been considered to be impaired based on the results of this first step 

  

defined benefit plans we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees all of these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans for example as of december 31 2006 a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately 32 million 

  

valuation of stock compensation  the fair value of each option grant in 2005 and thereafter is estimated on the date of grant using a latticebased option valuation model in past years the company has used the blackscholes optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of its options the lattice model uses 1 a constant volatility 2 an employee exercise behavior model based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior and 3 the treasury yield curve to calculate the fair value of each option grant the company continues to use the blackscholes optionpricing model to calculate the fair value of shares issued under the 2000 employee stock purchase plan 

  

convertible redeemable preferred stock during the periods the convertible redeemable preferred stock was outstanding we accounted for the difference between the carrying amount of the convertible redeemable preferred stock and the redemption value by increasing the carrying amount for periodic accretion so that the carrying amount would equal the redemption value at the earliest available redemption date the periodic accretion amount changed as our stock price changed and as additional dividends accrued based on the average closing price of our common stock over the last 30 trading days preceding december 31 2003 of 619 the accretion charge in respect to the redemption feature for 2003 was 05 million we also recognized an additional accretion charge of 18 million during the first quarter of 2004 however due to declines in our stock price after the first quarter of 2004 the average closing price used in the accretion calculation at the end of each quarter was below the level that would result in accretion the average closing price of our common stock over the last 30 trading days preceding december 31 2004 was 422 therefore the previously recognized accretion charges began to be reversed on a straightline basis through september 7 2009 unless future increases to our stock price required further accretion during 2004 previously recognized accretion charges of 03 million were reversed resulting in net accretion charges of 15 million during 2004 on november 10 2005 we entered into a conversion and termination agreement with tpg to convert the preferred stock into 49364080 shares of our common stock during 2005 previously recognized accretion charges of 10 million were reversed 

  

asset retirement obligations we recognize asset retirement obligations “aros” when incurred with the initial measurement at fair value these liabilities are accreted to full value over time through charges to income in addition asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s respective useful life our aros consist primarily of estimated decontamination costs associated with manufacturing equipment and buildings 

  

contingencies we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in february of 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid instruments — an amendment of fasb statements no 133 and no 144” “sfas no 155” sfas no 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation it also clarifies which interestonly strips and principalonly strips are not subject to the 

  

requirements of fasb statement no 133 and establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation furthermore sfas no 155 clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and it amends fasb statement no 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument sfas no 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after september 15 2006 our adoption of the provisions of sfas no 155 is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations 

  

in june 2006 the fasb ratified eitf issue no 0501 “accounting for the conversion of an instrument that becomes convertible upon the issuer’s exercise of a call option” “issue no 0501” issue no 0501 requires the conversion accounting model to be used when equity instruments are issued to settle an instrument that becomes convertible upon the issuer’s exercise of a call option if at issuance the debt instrument contains a substantive conversion feature the issuance of shares to settle the debt pursuant to the original terms of the instrument should be afforded conversion treatment however if the instrument does not contain a substantive conversion feature at issuance then the issuance of equity securities to settle the instrument should be recognized as a debt extinguishment a conversion feature is considered substantive if at issuance it is reasonably possible that the conversion feature will affect the manner of the debt instrument’s settlement issue no 0501 is effective for all conversions or settlements that result from exercise of call options occurring in interim or annual periods beginning after june 28 2006 while issue no 0501 requires entities to apply these rules to instruments issued prior to the effective date it does not require entities to evaluate and document whether the conversion feature was substantive at the time of issuance unless or until the conversion feature is exercised our adoption of the provisions of issue no 0501 is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations 

  

in june 2006 the fasb ratified eitf issue no 0603 “how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation” “issue no 0603” under issue no 0603 a company must disclose its accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of certain taxes if taxes included in gross revenues are significant a company must disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented ie both interim and annual periods taxes within the scope of this issue are those that are imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction taxes assessed on an entity’s activities over a period of time such as gross receipts taxes are not within the scope of the issue issue no 0603 is effective for the first annual or interim reporting period beginning after december 15 2006 we are currently evaluating the impact of issue no 0603 to our financial position and results of operations 

  

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertain tax positions” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we expect the cumulative effect of adopting fin 48 to be approximately 86 million primarily relating to penalties and interest on existing reserves for potential tax liabilities on our first quarter 2007 consolidated balance sheet the cumulative effect will be recorded as an increase to opening accumulated deficit thereby reducing total stockholders’ equity additionally the amount will be reflected as an increase to tax reserves included in other longterm liabilities 

  

in september of 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting procedures and expands disclosures on fair value measurements this statement applies under previously established valuation pronouncements and does not require the changing of any fair value measurements though it may 

  

cause some valuation procedures to change under sfas no 157 fair value is established by the price that would be received to sell the item or the amount to be paid to transfer the liability of the asset as opposed to the price to be paid for the asset or received to transfer the liability further it defines fair value as a market specific valuation as opposed to an entity specific valuation though the statement does recognize that there may be instances when the low amount of market activity for a particular item or liability may challenge an entity’s ability to establish a market amount in the instances that the item is restricted this pronouncement states that the owner of the asset or liability should take into consideration what affects the restriction would have if viewed from the perspective of the buyer or assumer of the liability this statement is effective for all assets valued in financial statements for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 157 to our financial position and result of operations 

  

in september of 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employer’s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” “sfas no 158” sfas no 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in the statement of financial position as well as to list in other comprehensive income net of tax the gains and losses and prior service costs or credit that were accrued during the financial period but were not recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost under sfas no 87 “employer’s accounting for pension” or sfas no 106 “employer’s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” it also requires all benefit plans postretirement or otherwise to be valued at the end of each fiscal year companies must disclose in the notes to financial statements any delayed gain or loss related to net periodic benefit cost sfas no 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 and has been adopted by the company in our financial statements at december 31 2006 see note 13 “employee benefit plans” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for the impact of our adoption of sfas no 158 

  

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” “sab 108” sab 108 specifies how the carryover or reversal of prioryear unrecorded financial statement misstatements should be considered in quantifying a currentyear misstatement sab 108 requires an approach that considers the amount by which the currentyear consolidated statement of income is misstated “rollover approach” and an approach that considers the cumulative amount by which the currentyear consolidated statement of financial condition is misstated “ironcurtain approach” prior to the issuance of sab 108 either the rollover or ironcurtain approach was acceptable for assessing the materiality of financial statement misstatements 

  

sab 108 became effective for our fiscal year ended december 31 2006 upon adoption sab 108 allowed a cumulativeeffect adjustment to opening retained earnings at january 1 2006 for prioryear misstatements that were not material under a prior approach but that were material under the sab 108 approach our adoption of sab no 108 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in november 2006 the fasb ratified eitf issue no 0606 “debtor’s accounting for a modification or exchange of convertible debt instruments” “issue no 0606” under issue no 0606 modifications and exchanges of debt instruments that a either add or eliminate an embedded conversion option or b affect the fair value of an existing embedded conversion option and how the issuer accounted for the modification issue no 0606 does not address modifications or exchanges of debt instruments in circumstances in which the embedded conversion option is separately accounted for as a derivative under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” prior to the modification subsequent to the modification or both prior to and subsequent to the modification issue no 0606 is effective for debt instruments subject to the above arrangements above that are entered into or modified subsequent to the ratification of issue no 0606 in november 2006 our adoption of eitf no 0606 is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

  

at december 31 2006 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 11760 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 9225 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 2535 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt however from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure as of december 31 2006 we had interest rate swaps covering 210 million of our variable interest rate debt a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately 02 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents as a result of the higher rates 

  

on january 9 2003 we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility becomes less than 25 million 

  

a majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however as a multinational business we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments this strategy reduces but does not eliminate the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements for example changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure

we currently have major design operations in arizona rhode island texas china the czech republic korea and france and we currently operate manufacturing facilities in arizona china the czech republic japan malaysia the philippines and slovakia we ceased manufacturing operations at our rhode island 

  

manufacturing facility in the second quarter of 2005 and exited the facility in the fourth quarter of 2005 the rhode island manufacturing facility is currently being marketed for sale in the second quarter of 2005 we announced the transfer of wafer fabrication manufacturing operations from our front end fabrication facility in malaysia to arizona we plan to complete this transfer by the fourth quarter of 2006 and to maintain the fabrication facility in malaysia for other manufacturing processes the transfer from malaysia to arizona did not impact our assembly and test operations in malaysia we also plan to sell certain unused portions of our property at our corporate headquarters in arizona and use some of the proceeds from the sale to upgrade portions of our corporate headquarters we will maintain our headquarters offices and existing manufacturing facilities on the portions of the property that are not for sale 

  

company history and capital structure 

  

formerly known as the semiconductor components group of the semiconductor products sector of motorola inc we were a whollyowned subsidiary of motorola prior to august 4 1999 we continue to hold through direct and indirect subsidiaries substantially all the assets and operations of the semiconductor components group of motorola’s semiconductor products sector on august 4 1999 we were recapitalized the “recapitalization” and certain related transactions were effected pursuant to an agreement among us our principal domestic operating subsidiary semiconductor components industries llc motorola and affiliates of texas pacific group “tpg” at the time of the recapitalization motorola agreed to provide us with transition and manufacturing services in order to facilitate our transition to a standalone company independent of motorola as of december 31 2003 all transition and manufacturing services related to the recapitalization agreement had been fulfilled 

  

on april 3 2000 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of cherry semiconductor corporation for 2532 million in cash including acquisition related costs which we financed with cash on hand and borrowings of 2200 million under our senior bank facilities cherry semiconductor corporation which we have renamed semiconductor components industries of rhode island inc designs and manufactures analog and mixed signal integrated circuits for the power management and automotive markets 

  

on may 3 2000 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock selling 345 million shares with an issue price of 16 per share net proceeds from the initial public offering after deducting issuance costs were approximately 5148 million the net proceeds were used to redeem all outstanding preferred stock including accrued dividends redeem a portion of the senior subordinated notes and prepay a portion of the loans outstanding under the senior bank facilities 

  

on september 7 2001 we obtained 1000 million 992 million net of issuance costs through an equity investment by an affiliate of texas pacific group our principal shareholder in this transaction we issued 10000 shares of mandatorily redeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock this investment was required because we were not in compliance with certain minimum interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants under our senior bank facilities in november 2005 we entered into a conversion and termination agreement with tpg to convert our redeemable convertible preferred stock into approximately 494 million shares of our common stock to induce the conversion we issued approximately 39 million additional shares of our common stock to tpg following the conversion none of the authorized shares of our preferred stock remained outstanding see note 9 “redeemable preferred stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in each case included elsewhere in this report 

  

debt refinancings and cost savings initiatives 

  

since our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors since the second half of 2003 we have engaged in several debt refinancing transactions which extended a portion of our debt maturities some of the transactions that extended our debt maturities also resulted in an increase in our overall interest expense and others lowered our overall interest expense in connection with these transactions we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things make our financial covenants less restrictive on the whole 

  

since 2003 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt and related interest costs we reduced both our total debt and interest expense as a result of our public offerings of common stock in september 2003 and february 2004 a portion of the proceeds from which we applied to prepay and redeem a portion of our outstanding debt prior to scheduled maturity we also lowered our interest expense further as a result of the issuance of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes in 2004 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes in 2005 and the refinancing of our senior bank facilities in 2004 and 2005 the proceeds from which were used to repay higher interest notes 

  

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 7 “longterm debt” and note 10 “common stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details on these financing activities 

  

since the fourth quarter of 2000 we have been implementing profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and as a result we expect to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure 

  

our 2004 profitability enhancement program included the phase out of our manufacturing operations in east greenwich rhode island which was announced in december 2003 and our assembly and test operations in the czech republic which was announced in november 2003 we began to realize savings from this program during the fourth quarter of 2004 with the full benefit beginning to be realized by the end of the fourth quarter of 2005 despite delays of approximately two quarters due to increased demand for bridge inventory the closure of our operations in east greenwich was completed in the third quarter of 2005 with all manufacturing equipment decommissioned and removed during the fourth quarter of 2005 we successfully completed the work related to the decommissioning of the manufacturing building which is currently being marketed for sale we expect to incur marginal operating expenses in 2006 to maintain the building until the sale is completed overall we expect the full cost savings from these activities will produce at least 20 million to 25 million of annual cost savings beginning in the first quarter of 2006 

  

in the first quarter of 2004 we entered into a fiveyear agreement with respect to the outsourcing of information technology infrastructure as part of the agreement we sold certain system software modules resulting in a loss on disposal of assets of 120 million as a result of these actions starting in the second quarter of 2004 we began to realize approximately 10 million per quarter of cost savings 

  

in the second quarter of 2004 we evaluated our operations in the czech republic and determined certain overhead functions were no longer necessary as a result of our previously announced transfer of our backend manufacturing lines in roznov to malaysia and the philippines following the reduction of such overhead functions we realized approximately 77 million of actual cost savings in 2005 

  

in the second quarter of 2005 we announced our plan to transfer wafer fabrication operations from our facility in malaysia to our facility in arizona by the end of 2006 which will eliminate approximately 80 jobs as a result of this action we expect to realize costs savings of approximately 250 million to 300 million over the next five years beginning in the third quarter of 2006 savings during 2006 are expected to be insignificant due to transition and other costs however savings during 2007 are expected to be approximately 7 million 

  

although we have production at several locations we have initiated process improvements and selective low cost capital acquisitions that we expect will increase our overall capacity our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on 

  

   

   

   

   

   

return to profitability 

  

in the third quarter of 2004 we returned to profitability after 14 consecutive quarters of net losses we were also profitable during all four quarters of 2005 our net income for the year ended december 31 2005 was 1006 million and was the highest annual net income since we began as a company after the recapitalization in 1999 this return to profitability was the result of increased demand for our products and cost savings from profitability enhancement programs and restructuring programs as well as debt refinancing opportunities that have reduced our interest costs

customers 

  

we have been doing business with 46 of our 50 largest customers for more than five years sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but do not require minimum purchase commitments most of our original equipment manufacturer customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the 

  

calendar year while our other customers including electronic manufacturer service providers generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of end markets computing automotive electronics consumer electronics industrial electronics wireless communications and networking sales to our largest customers arrow avnet and motorola accounted for approximately 9 13 and 10 respectively of our revenue during 2005 as compared to 9 12 and 8 during 2004 and 9 13 and 7 in 2003 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of 1 three years from the date of shipment or 2 the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog” below 

  

the following table sets forth our principal enduser markets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our revenues generated from each enduser market during 2005 sample applications for our products and representative original equipment manufacturer customers and end users 

  

end markets for our products 

  

   

   

original equipment manufacturers direct sales to original equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately 41 of our revenues in 2005 42 in 2004 and 42 in 2003 these customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as intel motorola nokia philips siemens and sony and in the automotive industry such as daimlerchrysler delphi trw and visteon we focus on three types of original equipment manufacturers multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core original equipment manufacturer customers the target market customers in the communications power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are original equipment manufacturers that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

  

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 48 of our revenues in 2005 47 in 2004 and approximately 47 in 2003 our distributors which include arrow avnet ebv elektronik future solomon enterprise and world peace resell to midsized and smaller original equipment manufacturers and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book or that is more than four years older than the manufacturing code date in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations 

  

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 11 of our revenues in each of 2005 2004 and 2003 our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are flextronics jabil and solectron these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many original equipment manufacturers now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace 

  

manufacturing operations 

  

we operate our manufacturing facilities either directly or through a joint venture five of these are frontend wafer sites located in japan slovakia the czech republic malaysia and the united states three are assembly and test sites located in china malaysia and the philippines in addition to these manufacturing and assembly operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 

  

during 2001 we decided to shut down our integrated facility in guadalajara mexico and transfer the frontend and assembly and test operations to other owned and contracted locations accordingly the guadalajara mexico facility ceased operations in the second quarter of 2002 and was sold in the third quarter of 2003  in november 2003 we announced our decision to discontinue our assembly and test operations at our site in roznov czech republic and move these operations to our facility in seremban malaysia and to contract manufacturers the transfer of assembly and test operations from our site in roznov czech republic was completed in 2004 in december 2003 we announced our decision to phase out manufacturing operations at our facility in east greenwich rhode island this closure was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 we transferred all of the production from this facility to our lower cost manufacturing facilities the east greenwich rhode island facility is currently on the market for sale 

  

during 2005 we announced a plan to close our frontend wafer manufacturing operations in seremban malaysia site2 and transfer production to our larger manufacturing facility in phoenix arizona our plan is to complete this transfer by the end of 2006 we plan to use the vacated manufacturing space in seremban malaysia site2 for future expansion of our assembly and test manufacturing in conjunction with our other manufacturing facility in seremban malaysia site1 also in 2005 we announced plans to sell unused portions of the phoenix arizona location 

  

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the products produced at these facilities the sizes of the locations represent the approximate gross square feet of each site’s building and include among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

  

   

we operate an assembly and test operations facility in leshan china we own this facility through a joint venture company leshanphoenix semiconductor company limited “leshan” of which we owned a majority 

  

of the outstanding equity interests as of december 31 2005 our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is a formerly stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 85 86 and 82 of leshan’s production capacity in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively and are currently committed to purchase approximately 85 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2006 in 2005 2004 and 2003 we incurred 02 million 05 million and 05 million in underutilization charges respectively as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan we supply die used in the production process 

  

the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations and we anticipate that any future expansion of our manufacturing capacity would involve this facility in june 2002 we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to 231 million in semiconductor operations which is in addition to the 278 million originally approved in 2004 we committed to make capital contributions of approximately 25 million to this joint venture by 2012 subject to market conditions we have the ability to time these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including ait ase kec magnachip phenitec and psi accounted for approximately 25 28 and 26 of our manufacturing costs in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

we entered into an agreement with motorola to continue to provide manufacturing services to each other for limited periods following our 1999 recapitalization we negotiated fixed prices with motorola for the services covered by these agreements to approximate each party’s cost of providing the services for 2003 motorola purchased 34 million of manufacturing services from us with no minimum purchase commitments going forward at this time these purchases are classified as revenues in our financial statements we purchased 89 million of manufacturing services from motorola in 2003 fulfilling our minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from motorola during such periods we currently have no minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from motorola related to the recapitalization agreement mentioned above

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

  

we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and operating losses in the future 

  

our historical financial results have been and our future financial results are anticipated to be subject to substantial fluctuations our revenues for 2005 were 12606 million compared to 12669 million for 2004 and 10691 million for 2003 we reported net income of 1006 million in 2005 and incurred net losses of 1237 million in 2004 and 1667 million in 2003 reduced enduser demand price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business and we may experience declines in revenue and operating losses in the future in order to remain profitable we must continue to successfully implement our business plan including our cost reduction initiatives however we also currently face an environment of uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our recent profitability 

  

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

  

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience such downturns in the future the most recent downturn which began in the fourth quarter of 2000 was severe and prolonged and it is uncertain whether recent improvements in semiconductor industry performance will continue or whether such improvements will benefit us to the same extent as they benefit other industry participants future downturns in the semiconductor industry may also be severe and prolonged future downturns in the semiconductor industry or any failure of the industry to fully recover from its recent downturn could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

during the 1990s and continuing into 2000 the semiconductor industry enjoyed unprecedented growth benefiting from the rapid expansion of the internet and other computing and communications technologies during 2001 we — like many of our customers and competitors — were adversely affected by a general economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the enduser products that incorporate our integrated circuits and standard semiconductors the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 also further depressed economic activity and demand for enduser products the impact of slowing endcustomer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of equipment and component inventories among our original equipment manufacturer subcontractor and distributor customers resulting in increasing pricing pressure we expect that factors including but not limited to economic uncertainty and downturns relating to the threat or actual occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks reduced demand for enduser products underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and changes in our revenue mix could adversely impact our operating results in the near term 

  

our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization 

  

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits as a percentage of revenues gross profit was 332 for 2005 compared to 324 for 2004 and 281 for 2003 gross profit improved in 2004 and 2005 in each case as a result of increased sales volume and cost savings from our profitability enhancement programs increased competition and other factors may lead to further price erosion lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

  

the failure to implement as well as the completion and impact of our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 

  

between 2000 and the end of 2005 we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in response to the significant downturn in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead however we cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will in and of themselves help us sustain our profitability 

  

we recorded restructuring charges of 33 million in 2005 196 million in 2004 and 612 million in 2003 to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments the impact of these restructuring actions on our ability to compete effectively is subject to risks and uncertainties because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 

  

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

  

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 continue to aggresively manage maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 expand further our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 reduce further the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 rationalize our manufacturing operations 7 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 8 reduce selling and administrative expenses 9 manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands 10 actively manage working capital 11 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 12 focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

  

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other things to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

  

we may require additional capital in the future and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 

  

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with the cash that we expect to generate from our operations and sales of assets in the ordinary course of business will be sufficient to meet our planned 

  

capital needs for the next 12 months however it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to fund our future activities or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses products or technologies as of february 10 2006 we had 136 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility subject to the restrictions contained in our senior bank facilities we may be able to raise these funds by selling securities to the public or selected investors or by borrowing money we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available we may be required to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development make selective dispositions of our assets or obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets or otherwise impair our ability to remain competitive 

  

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

  

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 

  

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

  

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty we routinely purchase inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

  

during various periods in 2003 2004 and 2005 short customer lead times prevailed given the overcapacity in the industry these and other factors adversely affected our revenues during these periods 

  

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

  

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for semiconductor components is highly competitive as a result of the recent economic downturn competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness 

  

many of our competitors may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories and presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

  

because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 

  

we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends 

  

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

  

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

  

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other things capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

  

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing and information technology and equipment to remain competitive the failure inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

  

our capital expenditures were 461 million in 2005 818 million in 2004 and 598 million in 2003 we may be required to increase our future capital expenditures to meet increased demand 

  

semiconductor manufacturing has historically required and in the future is likely to continue to require a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices we maintain certain of our own manufacturing assembly and test facilities which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 

  

we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency any such implementation however can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or in some instances to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned in the case of abandonment we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

  

we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing or information technology and equipment in addition our principal credit agreement limits the amount of our capital expenditures 

  

if we were to lose one of our large customers or if the existing downturn in the automotive market persists or deepens our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

  

product sales to our ten largest customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 55 54 and 54 of our total revenues in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

in 2005 approximately 19 of our total revenues were attributable to our various automotive customers certain of these automotive customers have been experiencing a downturn in their business in part due to labor difficulties on october 8 2005 delphi corporation one of our automotive customers and certain of its us subsidiaries commenced reorganization proceedings under chapter 11 of the us federal bankruptcy code in 2005 our sales to delphi accounted for less than 3 of our total annual revenues and approximately 54 million of our receivables due from delphi are subject to collection pending resolution of the reorganization proceedings there can be no assurance that other automotive customers will not also enter into reorganization proceedings or declare bankruptcy we may have to change our revenue recognition practices from an accrual basis to a cash basis for these customers if the collection of accounts receivable from them is not reasonably assured which would have an adverse impact on our profitability 

  

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

  

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including silicon wafers copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

in addition for some of our products such as our silicon germanium sige technology we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods these contract manufacturers including ait ase kec magnachip phenitec and psi accounted for approximately 25 28 and 26 of our manufacturing costs in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations could be adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 

  

acquisitions and strategic alliances may harm our operating results or cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities or dilute our stockholders 

  

we may in the future acquire and form strategic alliances relating to other businesses products and technologies successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts the difficulties of integration and alignment may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations the complexity of the technologies being integrated and aligned and the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures the integration and alignment of operations following an acquisition or alliance requires the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the daytoday business and may disrupt key research and development marketing or sales efforts in addition we may issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results without strategic acquisitions and alliances we may have difficulty meeting future customer product and service requirements 

  

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

  

approximately 24 60 and 16 of our revenues in 2005 approximately 28 56 and 16 of our revenues in 2004 and approximately 30 52 and 18 of our revenues in 2003 were derived from the americas the asiapacific region and europe including the middle east respectively we maintain significant operations in seremban malaysia carmona the philippines aizu japan leshan china roznov the czech republic and piestany the slovak republic in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

  

if we fail to attract and retain highlyskilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive for example analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel as employee incentives we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting at times our stock price has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely impact our results of operations prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 

  

technology companies like ours have a history of using broadbased employee stock option programs to hire incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” allowed companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options which would result in expense recognition for all options granted or using an intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion “apb” no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value recognition method we have elected to apply apb 25 and accordingly we generally do not recognize any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which replaces sfas no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 under sfas no 123r companies are required to measure the compensation costs of sharebased compensation arrangements based on the grantdate fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services the guidance provides that employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares are included within the term “sharebased compensation arrangements” public companies will be required to apply sfas no 123r as of the first annual reporting period beginning after june 15 2005 the cumulative effect of initially applying sfas no 123r if any is recognized as of the required effective date we plan to adopt sfas no 123r using the modified prospective application method as defined by sfas no 123r and accordingly will begin recognizing compensation expense in the first quarter of 2006 in light of our anticipated adoption of fas 123r we and our compensation committee are reevaluating our current incentive compensation strategies based on this reevaluation we may make changes to our policies and procedures regarding equitybased 

  

compensation the adoption of sfas no 123r beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 will have an adverse impact on our results of operations as we will be required to expense the fair value of our sharebased compensation arrangements rather than disclosing the impact on results of operations within our footnotes in accordance with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 123 this could negatively impact our future common stock price in addition this could impact our ability to utilize broadbased employee stock plans to reward employees and could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace 

  

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

  

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty patents or other intellectual property rights if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

  

we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 

  

we are party to securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

  

in july 2001 three stockholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us certain of our former officers current and former directors and various investment banking firms who acted as underwriters in connection with our initial public offering in may 2000 in april 2002 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint that supercedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint generally alleges that our offering documents failed to disclose certain underwriting fees and commissions and underwriter tieins and other arrangements with certain customers of the underwriters that impacted the price of our common stock in the aftermarket the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages on july 15 2002 together with other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the class action lawsuit on february 19 2003 the court dismissed claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws with prejudice however the court denied the motion to dismiss claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws in addition the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of claims brought against the current and former directors and officers who were named as individual defendants in the litigation in june 2003 upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation 

  

consummation of the proposed settlement is conditioned upon obtaining approval by the court on september 1 2005 the court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement directed that notice of the terms of the proposed settlement be provided to class members and scheduled a fairness hearing at which objections to the proposed settlement will be heard thereafter the court will determine whether to grant final approval to the proposed settlement if this proposed settlement is ultimately approved by the court it would result in a dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elect to participate in the proposed settlement together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants 

  

we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this securities litigation any conclusion of this litigation in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition the cost to us of defending the litigation even if resolved in our favor could be substantial such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of this litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future 

  

we are subject to litigation risks 

  

all industries including the semiconductor industry are subject to legal claims with and without merit we are involved in a variety of routine legal matters that arise in the normal course of business these matters typically fall into the following broad categories those involving suppliers and customers employment and labor and intellectual property we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a 

  

material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however defense and settlement costs can be substantial even with respect to claims that have no merit due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act 

  

we are spending a significant amount of management time and external resources to comply with changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which requires management’s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm we have completed this section 404 process for 2005 and in doing so we were required to hire additional personnel and use outside advisory services and as a result we incurred additional accounting and legal expenses we believe that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2005 however if in the future our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as specified by applicable sec rules and regulations andor other applicable standards our ability to publish accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be jeopardized and our common stock price and our business could be affected in a material adverse manner 

  

we do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting and more broadly our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent andor detect all errors and all fraud nevertheless our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives that being said a control procedure no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that objectives of the control procedure are met because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods has risks and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control because of its inherent limitations disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements further these sorts of controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within a company have been detected 

  

see part ii item 9a “controls and procedures” of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 

  

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other things regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such 

  

indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 

  

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

  

   

   

   

   

terrorist attacks such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington dc on september 11 2001 or threats or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades the markets in which we operate and our profitability 

  

on september 11 2001 the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope the threat or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades the market in which we operate and our profitability the terrorist attacks have caused instability in the global financial markets and future or threatened terrorist attacks or occurrences of international armed conflict could result in greater economic instability 

  

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

  

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

  

we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations as of december 31 2005 we had total longterm indebtedness of 10670 million including current maturities but excluding unused commitments and interest expense of 615 million for the year ended december 31 2005 also we may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments 

  

the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to you including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may incur more debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

  

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness but do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ current debt levels the related risks that we and they now face could intensify some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness 

  

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

  

our debt agreements contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our senior bank facilities require that we maintain or achieve a minimum consolidated ebitda as defined therein any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

  

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

  

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness as of february 10 2006 we had 136 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility on january 9 2003 we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than 25 million we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock 

  

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has ranged from a high of 2775 on the nasdaq national market on may 1 2000 to a low of 089 on october 4 2002 the last reported price of our common stock on february 10 2006 was 672 per share 

  

tpg as our principal stockholder controls our company which will limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters submitted for a vote of the stockholders 

  

on november 10 2005 tpg on holdings llc an affiliate of texas pacific group our largest shareholder converted its series a cumulative preferred stock into approximately 49 million shares of common stock we agreed to issue to tpg on holdings llc inducement shares upon conversion representing an 8 share premium of approximately 4 million shares of our common stock after the conversion of the preferred stock into common stock and the payment of the inducement shares texas pacific group and its affiliates’ beneficial ownership of the company’s common stock equaled approximately 1652 million shares as of february 10 2006 these shares represented 529 of the total voting power of our common stock as a result texas pacific group through its affiliates is able to 

  

   

   

   

in addition our certificate of incorporation provides that the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which relate to business combinations with interested stockholders do not apply to us 

  

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

 item 2 properties 

  

in the united states our corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing design center and research and development operations are located in approximately 15 million square feet of building space on property that we own in phoenix arizona we also lease properties around the world for use as sales offices design centers research and development labs warehouses logistic centers and trading offices the size andor location of these properties change from time to time based on business requirements we operate distribution centers which are leased or contracted through a third party in locations throughout asia europe and the americas we own our manufacturing facilities in the united states japan malaysia the philippines slovakia and the czech republic these facilities are primarily manufacturing operations but also include office utility laboratory facilities warehouse and unused space our joint venture in leshan china also owns manufacturing warehouse laboratory office and unused space 

  

in november 2003 we announced our decision to discontinue our assembly and test operations at our site in roznov czech republic and move these operations to our facility in seremban malaysia and to contract manufacturers the transfer of manufacturing was completed in 2004 in december 2003 we announced our decision to phase out manufacturing operations at our facility in east greenwich rhode island we completed 

  

this closure during the fourth quarter of 2005 we transferred the production from this facility to our lower cost manufacturing facilities this former manufacturing facility is currently being marketed for sale we still own and occupy an approximately 58000 square foot design center in east greenwich rhode island 

  

as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola conveyed to us the surface rights to a portion of the land located at our phoenix facility excluding the subsurface rights and conveyed buildings located at the phoenix facility these buildings do not include any treatment facilities relating to motorola’s environmental cleanup operations at the phoenix facility we executed a declaration of covenants easements and restrictions with motorola providing access easements for the parties and granting to us options to purchase or to lease the subsurface rights of the land in 2005 we announced plans to sell unused portions of the phoenix arizona location we plan to sell approximately 42 acres of land and three buildings located on this land the property and buildings are currently being marketed for sale the remainder of the phoenix site will continue as our corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing design center and research and development facility 

  

we believe that our facilities around the world whether owned or leased are well maintained we believe that we have sufficient access to productive capacity to meet our needs for the majority of the products in our business lines for the foreseeable future 

  

we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and similar assets of each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries but no more than 65 of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries held by them to secure our senior bank facilities 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on information currently available management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters including the matters described in the next paragraphs will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  

securities class action litigation 

  

during the period july 5 2001 through july 27 2001 we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our former officers current and former directors and the underwriters for our initial public offering the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york as abrams v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv6114 breuer v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv6287 and cohen v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv 6942 on april 19 2002 the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint alleges among other things that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters’ excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately 300 other publiclytraded companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city which have all been transferred along with the case against us to a single federal district judge for purposes of coordinated case management we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended and intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously the litigation process is inherently uncertain however and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us 

  

on july 15 2002 together with the other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them in addition the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual former officers and current and former directors who were named as defendants in our litigation and they are no longer parties to the litigation on february 19 2003 the court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants in that ruling the court granted in part and denied in part those motions as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws the court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to replead these claims as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded the court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well the court also denied the underwriter defendants’ motion to dismiss in all respects 

  

in june 2003 upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation if ultimately approved by the court this proposed settlement would result in the dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elect to participate in the proposed settlement together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants the proposed settlement does not provide for the resolution of any claims against the underwriter defendants and the litigation against those defendants is continuing the proposed settlement provides that the class members in the class action cases brought against the participating issuer defendants will be guaranteed a recovery of 1 billion by the participating issuer defendants if recoveries totaling less than 1 billion are obtained by the class members from the underwriter defendants the class members will be entitled to recover the difference between 1 billion and the aggregate amount of those recoveries from the participating issuer defendants if recoveries totaling 1 billion or more are obtained by the class members from the underwriter defendants however the monetary obligations to the class members under the proposed settlement will be satisfied in addition we and any other participating issuer defendants will be required to assign to the class members certain claims that we may have against the underwriters of our initial public offerings 

  

the proposed settlement contemplates that any amounts necessary to fund the settlement or settlementrelated expenses would come from participating issuers’ directors and officers’ liability insurance policy proceeds as opposed to funds of the participating issuer defendants themselves a participating issuer defendant could be required to contribute to the costs of the settlement if that issuer’s insurance coverage were insufficient to pay that issuer’s allocable share of the settlement costs we expect that our insurance proceeds will be sufficient for these purposes and that we will not otherwise be required to contribute to the proposed settlement 

  

consummation of the proposed settlement is conditioned upon obtaining approval by the court on september 1 2005 the court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement directed that notice of the terms of the proposed settlement be provided to class members and scheduled a fairness hearing for april 24 2006 at which objections to the proposed settlement will be heard thereafter the court will determine whether to grant final approval to the proposed settlement 

  

if the proposed settlement described above is not consummated we intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously while we can make no promises or guarantees as to the outcome of these proceedings we believe that the final result of these actions will have no material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

ams matter 

  

on march 22 2005 we entered into a settlement agreement with austriamicrosystems ag “ams” regarding a pending lawsuit under the settlement agreement we paid ams 24 million in cash upon the signing of the agreement we had previously reserved 25 million as a reasonable loss estimate of the loss exposure for 

  

this matter the settlement agreement includes among other things a full and complete mutual release of any and all claims except for any claims arising out of the arbitration described below it also provides that the pending litigation will be dismissed with prejudice and each party will bear its own costs and fees incurred in connection with the litigation this dismissal occurred shortly after the signing of the agreement the settlement agreement requires that we and ams enter into final binding and nonappealable arbitration limited to one unresolved issue associated with the pending litigation the arbitration is currently anticipated to be held during the second quarter of 2006 if the arbitrator rules in favor of ams we will pay an additional 22 million within fifteen days of the ruling by the arbitrator if the arbitrator rules in favor of us ams will not be entitled to any additional amounts of money from us each party shall bear its own costs and fees incurred in connection with the arbitration and the parties will each pay fifty percent of the costs and fees of the arbitrator 

  

the matter originated out of an action filed in october 2003 in arizona superior court by ams against us the complaint i alleged that we breached a foundry agreement entered into in 2000 under which ams was to provide services to us and ii claimed tortious interference with contract the complaint sought approximately 58 million in contract damages plus interest costs attorneys’ fees and exemplary damages 

  

we plan to vigorously defend ourselves at the arbitration and believe that we will prevail at the proceeding although there can be no assurances that this will in fact occur we believe that the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operation or cash flows 

  

other matters 

  

on september 30 2005 we entered into a settlement agreement with one of our customers and one of that customer’s customers resolving a potential claim against us for costs incurred in remedying certain alleged failures of products purchased directly or indirectly from us the potential claim which was estimated by our customer to aggregate approximately 312 million under the settlement agreement we agreed to pay our customer’s customer 25 million in cash and each party agreed to bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the claim at the same time we entered into separate agreements with our customer in part as a result of the claim and in part in an effort to increase our business with the customer pursuant to which we agreed to i provide certain rebates to the customer for products and services purchased from us by them for a period of five years beginning october 1 2005 and ii rebate not less than 25 million in cash regardless of actual purchases no later than september 25 2006 the amounts were considered to be warranty claims resulting in a warranty expense of 50 million during the year ended december 31 2005

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this form 10k management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains statements that are forwardlooking these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk uncertainties and other factors actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this form 10k 

  

executive overview 

  

this section presents summary information regarding our industry markets and operating trends only for further information regarding the events summarized herein you should read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in its entirety 

  

industry overview 

  

worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 2275 billion in 2005 an increase of 68 from 2130 billion in 2004 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by the world semiconductor trade statistics group to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market since 2001 

  

     

following the unprecedented semiconductor industry revenue declines of 2001 the semiconductor industry began to show signs of stability in 2002 and grew more robust in both 2003 and 2004 worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by 183 in 2003 280 in 2004 and 68 in 2005 sales in our total addressable market grew by 142 in 2004 and 144 in 2003 reflecting increases in volume and slowing rates of price declines sales in our total addressable market remained stable in 2005 reflecting increases in volume that were offset by price declines the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately 6 during 2004 through 2008 these are projections and may not be indicative of actual results 

  

business overview 

  

we classify our products broadly as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components we design manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products our power management semiconductor components control convert protect and monitor the supply of power to the 

  

different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our data management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all electronic devices these various products fall into the logic analog and discrete categories used by wsts 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand has reached levels above capacity production capabilities shortages have begun to occur which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

  

during the first half of 2005 we experienced an increase in the end market unit demand sufficient to offset price decreases we also enjoyed growth in bookings during the second quarter with the book to bill ratio above one for the first quarter since the second quarter of 2004 during the second half of 2005 we also experienced an increase in the end market unit demand sufficient to grow revenues despite price decreases we expect price declines during 2006 to be moderate and we will continue to monitor the supply and demand picture to determine if pricing could be held or increased 

  

cost savings and restructuring activities 

  

since the fourth quarter of 2000 we have been implementing profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and as a result we expect to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure 

  

our 2004 profitability enhancement program includes the phase out of our manufacturing operations in east greenwich rhode island which was announced in december 2003 and our assembly and test operations in the czech republic which was announced in november 2003 we began to realize savings from this program during the fourth quarter of 2004 with the full benefit beginning by the end of the fourth quarter of 2005 despite delays of approximately two quarters due to increased demand the closure of our operations in east greenwich was completed in the third quarter of 2005 with all manufacturing equipment decommissioned and removed during the fourth quarter of 2005 we successfully completed the work related to the decommissioning of the manufacturing building which is currently being marketed for sale we expect to incur marginal operating expenses in 2006 to maintain the building until the sale is completed overall we expect the full cost savings from these activities will produce at least 20 million to 25 million of annual cost savings beginning in the first quarter of 2006 

  

in the second quarter of 2004 we evaluated our operations in the czech republic and determined certain overhead functions were no longer necessary as a result of our previously announced transfer of our backend manufacturing lines in roznov to malaysia and the philippines following the reduction of such overhead functions we realized approximately 77 million of actual cost savings in 2005 

  

we expect the total estimated annualized cost savings from the 2004 profitability enhancement program including the transfer of our backend manufacturing lines from roznov to malaysia to reduce our cost of revenues due to reduced employee costs reduced depreciation and other cost savings by 183 million to 209 million 30 million to 38 million and 64 million to 80 million respectively 

  

in the first quarter of 2004 we entered into a fiveyear agreement with respect to the outsourcing of information technology infrastructure as part of the agreement we sold certain system software modules resulting in a loss on disposal of assets of 120 million as a result of these actions starting in the second 

  

quarter of 2004 we began to realize approximately 40 million of annualized cost savings that reduces our general and administrative expenses due to reduced depreciation expense 

  

in the second quarter of 2005 we announced our plan to transfer wafer fabrication operations from our facility in malaysia to our facility in arizona by the end of 2006 which will eliminate approximately 80 jobs as a result of this action we expect to realize costs savings of approximately 250 million to 300 million over the next five years beginning in the third quarter of 2006 savings during 2006 are expected to be insignificant due to transition and other costs however savings during 2007 are expected to be approximately 7 million 

  

although we have production at several locations we have initiated process improvements and selective low cost capital acquisitions that we expect will increase our overall capacity our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on 

  

   

   

   

   

   

new product innovation 

  

as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives excluding the introduction of leadfree products we introduced 133 new products in 2005 119 new products in 2004 and 260 new products in 2003 our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications it is our practice to regularly reevaluate our research and development spending to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position us for continued growth as a result we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity analog standard component mos power and clock and data management products we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 

  

debt reduction and financing activities 

  

since our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors during 2002 and 2003 we engaged in several debt refinancing transactions which extended a portion of our debt maturities some of the transactions that extended our debt maturities also resulted in an increase in our overall interest expense and others lowered our overall interest expense in connection with these transactions we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things make our financial covenants less restrictive on the whole 

  

in the second half of 2003 and continuing into 2004 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt and related interest costs we reduced both our total debt and interest expense as a result of our public offerings of common stock in september 2003 and february 2004 a portion of the proceeds from which we applied to prepay and redeem a portion of our outstanding debt prior to scheduled maturity we also lowered our interest expense further as a result of the issuance of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of our senior bank facilities the proceeds from which were used to repay higher interest notes 

  

in the second half of 2005 we continued these measures to reduce our interest costs by issuing 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes and using the proceeds from the issuance along with cash on hand to repay our junior subordinated note which carried a significantly higher interest rate than the convertible senior subordinated notes in november 2005 our outstanding series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock beneficially owned by an affiliate of the texas pacific group “tpg” was converted into common stock which eliminated the accrual of preferred stock dividends additionally in december 2005 and also in january 2006 we refinanced the term loans under our senior bank facilities to reduce the interest rate on the senior bank facilities 

  

as a result of these debt prepayments and refinancings we reduced our total longterm debt balance including the current portion from 13029 million as of december 31 2003 to 10670 million as of december 31 2005 we also reduced our interest expense from 1511 million for the year ended december 31 2003 to 615 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

the details of each of these financing events are outlined in the following sections also see “liquidity and capital resources” elsewhere in this report and note 7 “longterm debt” note 9 “redeemable preferred stock” and note 10 “common stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

outlook 

  

based upon booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we anticipate that revenues will be approximately 3300 million in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to revenues of 3024 million in the first quarter of 2005 and revenues of 3418 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of 2006 were up from backlog levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2005 and represented over 90 percent of our anticipated first quarter 2006 revenues we expect average selling prices will be down approximately one percent in the first quarter of 2006 we also expect that cost reductions will offset the decline in average selling prices and that gross profit will be flat at approximately 35 in the first quarter of 2006 beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we are required to expense stock based compensation in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “share based payment” we currently expect this expense to be approximately 20 million in the first quarter of 2006 due to the volatility of the price of our common stock and the uncertainty of future option grants to employees we are unable to estimate this expense for periods subsequent to the first quarter of 2006 

  

on november 16 2005 we accelerated the vesting of certain unvested and “outofthemoney” stock options outstanding under our stock plans the acceleration of vesting applied to all unvested options that had an exercise price per share of 700 or higher with the exception of options granted to directors certain officers and employees with options granted under the french provisions in our 2000 stock incentive plan as a result of the acceleration options to purchase approximately 25 million shares of our common stock became exercisable immediately the weighted average exercise price of the affected options was 704 per share in making the decision to accelerate these options the board of directors believed it was in the best interest of the stockholders to reduce the future earnings impact resulting from the planned adoption of sfas 123r in the first quarter of 2006 and the resulting impact that this may have on our market value this acceleration of these options that were outstanding on november 16 2005 is expected to reduce future expenses on a pretax basis by approximately 36 million in 2006 

  

for the first quarter of 2006 we expect selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses at approximately 12 of revenues and research and development expenses at approximately 7 of revenues we anticipate that net interest expense will be approximately 125 million for the first quarter of 2006 for the year ended december 31 2006 we anticipate cash capital expenditures will be approximately 110 million 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 the amounts in the following table are in millions 

  

   

revenues 

  

revenues were 12606 million 12669 million and 10691 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the slight decrease from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 6 partially offset by increased sales volume the increase from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to increased sales volume which was partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 3 average selling prices dropped in each quarter of 2003 due to industry competition however as capacity utilization began to exceed 85 on an industrywide basis during the third quarter of 2003 prices began to stabilize the revenues by product line in each of these three years were as follows dollars in millions 

  

     

revenues from our power management and standard analog product line declined from 2004 to 2005 and increased from 2003 to 2004 in 2005 the decrease can be attributed to a decrease in revenues from the automotive electronics and wireless communications end markets partially offset by an increase in revenues from the computing end market in 2004 revenues increased as increases in demand for consumer electronics and portable wireless devices were slightly offset by further decreases in automotive electronic product revenue 

  

revenues from mos power devices decreased from 2004 to 2005 and increased from 2003 to 2004 the decrease from 2004 to 2005 can be primarily attributed to a decrease in revenue from the computing end market and to the discontinuance of select products sold into the automotive electronics end markets partially offset by an increase in revenues from the wireless communications end markets the growth in revenue from 2003 to 2004 can be attributed to increased demand across all markets with primary growth in revenue attributed to the ongoing introduction of new devices for specific end markets such as computing portable and consumer electronics as well as modest increases in the automotive electronics end market 

  

revenues from high frequency clock and data management products decreased from 2004 to 2005 and increased from 2003 to 2004 the decrease in 2005 can be attributed to decreased demand across all markets which has been most pronounced in the industrial electronics and networking end markets the growth in this sector in 2004 was primarily driven by an increase in the industrial electronics end markets which was attributable to increased revenue from automated test equipment partially offset by decreases in the networking end market 

  

revenues from standard components increased steadily from 2003 to 2005 this product line consists of many products that are available from numerous competitors in the marketplace and is thus heavily influenced by pricing pressures and general market conditions the increase in revenue from 2004 to 2005 can be primarily attributed to an increase in revenues from the wireless communications end market partially offset by a decrease in revenue from the industrial electronics and consumer end markets the increase in revenue from 2003 to 2004 was attributed to increased demand across all markets with significant increases in demand for end products used in wireless communications and handheld applications and consumer electronics 

  

revenues by geographic area as a percentage of revenues were as follows 

  

   

a majority of our end customers served directly or through distribution channels are manufacturers of electronic devices in recent years there has been a trend toward moving such manufacturing activities to lower cost regions particularly in asia our shift in revenues by geographic area reflects this trend 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 4185 million 4099 million and 3007 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively as a percentage of revenues our gross profit was 332 324 and 281 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively gross profit increased during 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to cost savings from our profitability enhancement programs and increased sales volume which were partially offset by declines in average selling prices gross profit increased during 2004 as compared to 2003 due to increased sales volume and cost savings from our profitability enhancement programs which were partially offset by a decline in average selling prices 

  

since the fourth quarter of 2000 we have been implementing profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and as a result we expect to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure in 2004 we realized approximately 73 million of cost savings as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2003 and in 2005 we realized approximately 79 million of cost savings as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2004 these savings are as a result of our manufacturing rationalization plan reductions in nonmanufacturing personnel and other cost controls 

  

operating expenses 

  

research and development expenses were 937 million 944 million and 855 million representing 74 75 and 80 of revenues in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the decrease from 2004 to 2005 was primarily attributable to the absence of software application costs associated with the implementation of cost management technology which occurred in 2004 partially offset by increased employee salaries and wages and increased headcount as well as an increase in performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals the increase from 2003 to 2004 was attributable to increased employee salaries and wages and an increase in performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals as well as software application costs associated with the implementation of the cost management technology discussed above 

  

selling and marketing expenses were 793 million 738 million and 630 million representing 63 58 and 59 of revenues in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increases from 2003 to 2005 were attributable to increased employee salaries and wages and increased headcount of our internal sales and marketing personnel which include management positions and field application engineers as well as an increase in employee performance bonuses as a result of our achievement of certain financial goals and increased commissions we plan to make investments in our sales and marketing systems to identify new customers as well as to expand our penetration of existing customers in selected product areas 

  

general and administrative expenses were 746 million 722 million and 692 million representing 59 57 and 65 of revenues in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase from 2004 to 2005 was attributable to increased costs for external services including audit and consulting services and an increase in 

  

employee performance bonuses associated with our achievement of certain financial results partially offset by savings from personnel reductions functional relocations and lower depreciation the increase from 2003 to 2004 was attributable to increased costs for external services including audit and consulting services and an increase in employee performance bonuses associated with our achievement of certain financial results partially offset by lower depreciation as a result of our saleleaseback transaction in the first quarter of 2004 and cost savings from the relocation of functions to lower cost regions 

  

amortization of other intangibles was 0 0 and 59 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively as a result of the adoption of sfas no 142 effective january 1 2002 we eliminated the amortization of goodwill see note 3 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report as discussed in further detail below amortization of our developed technology intangible asset ceased following the second quarter of 2003 when we wroteoff the remaining balance acquired in connection with our acquisition of cherry semiconductor in april 2000 

  

other operating expenses — restructuring asset impairments and other 

  

restructuring asset impairments and other charges were 33 million 196 million and 612 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively our individual quarterly restructuring charges are summarized below for more information see note 5 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 615 million 1012 million and 1511 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the decrease in interest expense from 2003 to 2004 was primarily a result of interest savings from the prepayment of our firstlien senior secured notes secondlien senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes which occurred throughout 2004 the decrease in interest expense from 2004 to 2005 was primarily a result of interest savings during the entire year of 2005 that resulted from the refinancings that had occurred during 2004 our weightedaverage interest rate on longterm debt including current maturities was 54 86 and 108 per annum in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively see “liquidity and capital resources — key financing events” for a description of our refinancing activities 

  

loss on debt prepayment 

  

loss on debt prepayment totaled 1597 million and 77 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively the loss on debt prepayment of 1597 million in 2004 includes approximately 1136 million incurred for call and consent fees tender offer fees dealer manager fees and arrangement fees as well as approximately 457 million of debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts that were written off and 04 million of certain thirdparty costs incurred these costs were incurred in 2004 in connection with the repayment of the firstlien senior secured notes secondlien senior secured notes the senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of the senior bank facilities the loss on debt prepayment of 77 million in 2003 represents the writeoff of debt issuance costs and certain thirdparty costs incurred with respect to debt refinancings that occurred during 2003 see “liquidity and capital resources — key financing events” for a description of our refinancing activities 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

provision for income taxes was 15 million 74 million and 77 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

the 2005 provision included 61 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and 76 million of new reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions partially offset by the reversal of 95 million of previously accrued income taxes for anticipated audit issues and the reversal of a 27 million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for one of our japanese subsidiaries that returned to profitability 

  

the 2004 provision related primarily to income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and also included the reversal of 112 million of previously accrued income taxes after the completion of an examination of our income tax returns for the years 2001 2000 and 1999 by the internal revenue service which resulted in no material change in our tax liability for those years partially offset by a new reserve of 99 million against certain foreign income tax receivables that we determined may not be collectible creating additional tax expense for the year 

  

the 2003 provision related primarily to income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations 

  

cumulative effect of accounting change 

  

cumulative effect of accounting change net of income taxes was 29 million in 2005 and 215 million in 2003 

  

in 2005 we recorded a 29 million charge net of taxes of 03 million upon adoption of fin 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” “fin 47” which requires recognition of liabilities for legal obligations to perform asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity see “accounting changes” for further discussion of fin 47 

  

in 2003 we changed our method of accounting for net unrecognized actuarial gains or losses relating to our defined benefit pension obligations the impact of this change for periods prior to january 1 2003 was a charge of 215 million both before and after income taxes and was reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 2003 see “accounting changes” for further discussion 

  

reportable segments 

  

as previously discussed our reportable segments are aligned internally as the integrated power group and the analog products group these segments represent our view of the company and inform how we evaluate the progress of its major components information about our reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 are as follows in millions corresponding information for the year ended december 31 2003 is not included because it would be impractical to do so as operating expenses were not allocated in the same manner or detail that would allow for comparable disclosures 

  

   

revenues from external customers for the integrated power group and for the analog products group for the year ended december 31 2003 were 5753 million and 4938 million respectively 

  

depreciation and amortization expense is included in segment operating income 

  

reconciliations of segment information to consolidated financial statements in millions 

  

   

the increase in other unallocated manufacturing costs from 115 million in 2004 to 518 million in 2005 was due primarily to manufacturing costs we continued to incur at our east greenwich rhode island manufacturing facility in 2005 beyond the original anticipated closure date of that facility which we did not allocate to the reportable segments as discussed previously the closure of the east greenwich facility was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 and all of the production from this facility was transferred to our lower cost manufacturing facilities 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements our sources and uses of cash our debt and debt covenants and our management of cash 

  

cash requirements 

  

commercial commitments contractual obligations and indemnities 

  

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our longterm debt operating leases pension obligations and purchase obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future in millions 

  

     

our longterm debt includes 6391 million under senior bank facilities 2600 million of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 950 million under our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 154 million under a note payable to a japanese bank 140 million under a loan facility with a chinese bank 344 million under a loan facility with another chinese bank and 91 million of capital lease obligations see note 7 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

in the normal course of our business we enter into various operating leases for equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

  

our other longterm contractual obligations consist of estimated payments to fund liabilities that have been accrued in our consolidated balance sheet for our us and foreign pension plans see note 12 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report the us pension plan named the on semiconductor grandfathered pension plan “grandfathered plan” has been terminated effective december 31 2004 as approved by the pension benefit guaranty corporation in 2005 and such termination was determined by the internal revenue service not to adversely affect its qualification for federal tax purposes in connection with the termination of our grandfathered plan all cash funding requirements 

  

for the liability have been settled and the related plan assets have been distributed as of december 31 2005 the remaining obligation in the table above includes estimated funding requirements for liabilities related to our foreign pension plans 

  

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 2333 million at december 31 2005 we believe that our cash flows from operations coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs over the next 12 months our senior bank facilities include a 250 million revolving facility letters of credit totaling 117 million were outstanding under the revolving facility at december 31 2005 we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than 25 million 

  

contingencies 

  

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to intellectual property infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

  

we are a party to various agreements with motorola a former affiliate which were entered into in connection with our separation from motorola pursuant to these agreements we have agreed to indemnify motorola for losses due to for example breach of representations and warranties and covenants damages arising from assumed liabilities or relating to allocated assets and for specified environmental matters our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and payment by us is conditioned on motorola making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract which procedures typically allow us to challenge motorola’s claims 

  

we provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

  

in addition to the above from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 

  

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report for possible contingencies related to legal matters and see part i item 1 “business — government regulation” of this report for information on certain environmental matters 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand and targeted asset sales additionally as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 

  

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

  

   

   

our ability to service our longterm debt to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may beyond our control 

  

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through december 31 2006 to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

  

operations 

  

our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash and our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities each of these components is discussed herein 

  

ebitda 

  

earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” is a key indicator that management uses to evaluate our operating performance and cash flows while ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity we believe this measure is useful to investors to assess our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditure and working capital requirements this calculation may differ in method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies the following table sets forth our ebitda for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 with a reconciliation to cash flows from operations the most directly comparable financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles in millions 

  

   

as a result of the improved operating performance we generated positive ebitda for 2003 2004 and 2005 ebitda for 2003 was 1179 million primarily as a result of the restructuring asset impairment and other net charges in 2003 that were 335 million higher than those in 2002 and a cumulative effect of accounting change of 215 million in 2003 ebitda for 2004 declined to 848 million primarily as a result of the charges associated with our previously described debt refinancings partially offset by improved operating performance ebitda for 2005 increased to 2571 million largely due to the generation of net income of 1006 million for the year 

  

as discussed in note 7 “longterm debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report our debt covenants require us to maintain a trailing 12month minimum adjusted ebitda of 1400 million adjusted ebitda as defined under the documents for our senior bank facilities totaled approximately 2787 million for the 12 months ended december 31 2005 this adjusted ebitda computation excludes certain restructuring and other charges and contains other differences from the ebitda as defined above therefore ebitda in the above table is not representative of the adjusted ebitda used to determine our debt covenant compliance 

  

if we were not in compliance with the covenants contained in our senior secured credit agreement including the adjusted ebitda maintenance covenant the holders of our senior secured indebtedness could cause all outstanding amounts to be due and payable immediately if we were unable to repay refinance or restructure that indebtedness the holders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any such event of default or declaration of acceleration could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

working capital 

  

working capital fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs our working capital including cash was 2020 million at december 31 2005 and has fluctuated between 2020 million and 3003 million over the last eight quarterends 

  

the components of our working capital at december 31 2005 and 2004 are set forth below in millions followed by explanations for changes between 2004 and 2005 for cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and any other changes greater than 5 million 

  

   

the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 476 million in 2005 was attributable to cash flow from operations of approximately 1925 million partially offset by cash used in investing activities excluding shortterm investment activity of 456 million and cash used in financing activities of 996 million which was attributable to debt repayments see “key financing events” below 

  

the increase of 287 million in accounts receivable is the result of increased sales in the last two months of the fourth quarter of 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004 

  

the decrease of 239 million in inventory is attributable to sales levels exceeding production levels for the year inventory levels were a record low as of december 31 2005 based on the outlook for the first quarter of 2006 we anticipate relatively flat inventory levels at the end of the first quarter of 2006 

  

the increase of 63 million in other current assets is a result of a 30 million reclassification of the net book value of certain assets heldforsale which includes buildings located in phoenix arizona and east greenwich rhode island that are currently being marketed for sale and an increase of 26 million in cash flow hedges partially offset by a decrease of 27 million in deferred compensation the balance of the increase is related to miscellaneous prepaid expenses for it projects in the united states 

  

the increase of 329 million in accounts payable was mainly a result of the timing of payments at the respective year ends and an increase in fixed asset additions during the fourth quarter of 2005 of 339 million of which approximately 223 million remained unpaid as of december 31 2005 as compared to fixed asset additions of 167 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 

  

the decrease in accrued expenses of 165 million was primarily attributable to the settlement of the us pension liability of 205 million attributable to our pension plan for us employees and a decrease in the restructuring accrual of 66 million which was partially offset by an increase in the employee bonus accrual in the amount of 104 million 

  

the increase in the current portion of longterm debt relates to the timing of payments under our debt instruments including 260 million related to required payments under the free cash flow provision of our senior bank facilities see note 7 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

longterm assets and liabilities 

  

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets foreign tax receivables and capitalized debt issuance costs 

  

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently accordingly we reduced our capital expenditures during 2005 we do not expect that our capital expenditure reductions will have a negative impact on our ability to service our customers as we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties capital expenditures were 461 million 818 million and 598 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively during 2003 there was an excess supply of used semiconductor production equipment in the marketplace and we were able to purchase additional equipment at discounted prices we will continue to look for opportunities to make similar strategic purchases in the future as we plan to invest approximately 110 million in 2006 for additional capacity although our debt covenants contain certain restrictions that limit our amount of future capital expenditures we do not believe that these restrictions will have a significant impact on our future operating performance 

  

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and tax reserves in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans generally our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the 

  

plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions see note 12 “employee benefit plans” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our tax reserves see note 8 “income taxes” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

key financing events 

  

overview 

  

set forth below is a summary of the key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years 

  

since we became an independent company as a result of our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors our longterm debt includes significant amounts under our senior bank facilities which contain an ebitda as defined for such facilities covenant with which we were in compliance as of december 31 2005 

  

during the second half of 2003 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt reduce related interest costs and in some cases extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility in september 2003 we issued approximately 370 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 450 per share the net proceeds of which were used to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities in connection with this offering we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things extend the average maturity of the term loans under these facilities through a refinancing of 100 million of such loans and replacement of our 625 million revolving facility with a new 250 million revolving facility 

  

in november 2003 we further amended our senior bank facilities to among other things reduce the interest rate on our outstanding term loans by 075 also in november 2003 we exercised our option to extend the maturity of our 200 million loan facility with a chinese bank for an additional three years under the same terms and conditions in december 2003 we prepaid approximately 480 million of loans under our senior bank facilities with the proceeds from a new loan facility with a separate chinese bank that bears interest at the london interbank offered rate or libor plus 15 

  

in the first quarter of 2004 we used a portion of the net proceeds of the sale of approximately 344 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 698 per share to redeem 70 million principal amount of our firstlien senior secured notes due 2010 and 105 million principal amount of our secondlien senior secured notes due 2008 at a redemption price of 112 of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date in connection with these prepayments we incurred 210 million of premium payments the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of indebtedness in connection with the offering we further amended our senior bank facilities to permit us to use the proceeds of such offering within 270 days of completion to purchase redeem or retire a portion of our senior subordinated notes due 2009 and our firstlien senior secured notes and secondlien senior secured notes 

  

in april 2004 we issued 2600 million of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes and used the proceeds and cash and cash equivalents to repay 2600 million of our senior subordinated notes during the second and third quarters of 2004 we also further amended our senior bank facilities see “april 2004 offer to repurchase senior subordinated notes and issuance of zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes” below 

  

in december 2004 we refinanced the term loan portion of our senior bank facilities and increased our total term borrowings to 6455 million proceeds from the refinancing were used to prepay the remaining 1300 million principal outstanding of the firstlien senior secured notes due 2010 and the entire 1950 million principal outstanding of the secondlien senior secured notes due 2008 in connection with these prepayments we incurred 672 million of premium payments 

  

in november 2005 we repaid 664 million of the principal amount outstanding under our junior subordinated note with cash on hand and repaid the remaining principal balance of the note in december 2005 with the proceeds of the issuance of 950 million of 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 

  

also in november 2005 we entered into a conversion and termination agreement with an affiliate of tpg to convert its preferred stock into approximately 494 million shares of our common stock to induce the conversion we issued approximately 39 million additional shares of our common stock to such affiliate of tpg following the conversion none of the authorized shares of preferred stock remained outstanding see part ii item 9b “other information” of this report for the status of the certificate of designations for the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock 

  

as a result of these debt prepayments and refinancings we reduced our total longterm debt balance including the current portion from 13029 million as of december 31 2003 to 10670 million as of december 31 2005 we also reduced our interest expense from 1511 million for the year ended december 31 2003 to 615 million for the year ended december 31 2005 we also eliminated an 8 dividend on our preferred stock that totaled 92 million in 2005 

  

the details of each of these financing events are outlined below 

  

march 2003 issuance of firstlien senior secured notes and amendment to senior bank facilities 

  

on march 3 2003 we issued 2000 million aggregate principal amount of firstlien senior secured notes due 2010 the firstlien senior secured notes were issued at a price of 95467 of par bore interest at a rate of 12 per annum payable semiannually in cash and had a maturity date of march 15 2010 

  

in connection with the offering of the firstlien senior secured notes we further amended our senior bank facilities to among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we used 1809 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of the notes to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities 250 million of which was used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and permanently reduce the commitments thereunder to such amount in connection with this refinancing we wrote off 35 million of debt issuance costs 

  

september 2003 public offering of common stock and amendment to senior bank facilities 

  

on september 23 2003 we issued approximately 370 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 450 per share the net proceeds of the offering were 1568 million after deducting the underwriters’ discount of 82 million and offering expenses of 14 million after further evaluation we reversed

as part of the recapitalization semiconductor components industries llc our primary domestic operating subsidiary issued a 910 million junior subordinated note due 2011 during periods it was outstanding the note bore interest at an annual rate of 100 compounded semiannually and payable at maturity the note was junior in right of payment to all senior debt in november 2005 we repaid 664 million of the junior subordinated note with cash on hand which reduced the outstanding principal amount to approximately 910 million 

  

in order to finance the repayment of the remaining principal amount of the junior subordinated note in december 2005 we issued 950 million of 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 we received 

  

net proceeds of approximately 910 million from the sale of the notes after deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses of 40 million which were capitalized as debt issuance costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method through the first put date of december 15 2012 the notes bear interest at the rate of 1875 per year from the date of issuance interest on the notes is payable on june 15 and december 15 of each year beginning on june 15 2006 the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries

january 2006 amendment to senior bank facilities 

  

in january 2006 we refinanced the term loans under our senior bank facilities to reduce the interest rate from libor plus 275 to libor plus 250 the amended and restated credit agreement also provides for a step down provision that would further reduce the interest rate to libor plus 225 if we maintain a specified credit rating and meet a specified leverage ratio test that would first apply based on the 2005 results 

  

debt instruments guarantees and related covenants 

  

the following table presents the components of longterm debt as of december 31 2005 and 2004 dollars in millions 

  

   

we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and similar assets of each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries but no more than 65 of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries held by them to secure our senior bank facilities 

  

semiconductor components industries llc the primary domestic operating subsidiary of on semiconductor corporation is the borrower under our senior bank facilities on semiconductor corporation and our other domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee on a joint and several basis the obligations of the borrower under such facilities on semiconductor corporation is the issuer and sci llc is a guarantor of our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 and our 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 our other domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee on a joint and several basis the obligations of the issuers of such notes none of our nonus subsidiaries guarantee the senior bank facilities or the notes 

  

as of december 31 2005 we were in compliance with the various covenants and other requirements contained in the credit agreement relating to our senior bank facilities and the indentures relating to our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024 and 1875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2025 we believe that we will be able to comply with the various covenants and other requirements contained in such credit agreement and the indentures through december 31 2006 

  

the credit agreement relating to our senior bank facilities includes a provision requiring an annual calculation of cash flow as defined and the application of a portion of that cash flow as a prepayment of loans outstanding under the agreement included in the current portion of longterm debt as of december 31 2005 was approximately 260 million which is the amount expected to be payable during the first quarter of 2006 under 

  

this provision we are currently discussing with our lenders an amendment of this provision that would require prepayment only at the election of individual lenders depending on the outcome of those discussions the amount we pay to our lenders during 2006 under this provision may be reduced 

  

our debt agreements contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our senior bank facilities require that we maintain or achieve a minimum consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined therein any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

cash management 

  

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

  

accounting changes 

  

effective december 31 2005 we adopted fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” “fin 47” fin 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” “statement 143” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity fin 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a result of the adoption of fin 47 we recorded a 29 net charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change in 2005 and we recorded a 40 million liability for asset retirement obligations included in other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

during the second quarter of 2003 we changed our method of accounting for net unrecognized actuarial gains or losses relating to our defined benefit pension obligations historically we amortized our net 

  

unrecognized actuarial gains or losses over the average remaining service lives of active plan participants to the extent that such net gains or losses exceeded the greater of 10 of the related projected benefit obligation or plan assets effective january 1 2003 we no longer defer any actuarial gains or losses but recognize such gains and losses during the fourth quarter of each year which is the period our annual pension plan actuarial valuations are prepared we believe that this change is to a preferable accounting method as actuarial gains or losses will be recognized currently in income rather than being deferred 

  

the impact of this change for periods prior to january 1 2003 was a charge of 215 million or 011 per share both before and after income taxes and has been reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations for 2003 the effect of the change in 2003 was to decrease the loss before cumulative effect of accounting change by 73 million or 004 per share both before and after income taxes and to increase the net loss by 142 million or 008 per share both before and after income taxes absent the accounting change the 215 million of net unrecognized actuarial losses at december 31 2002 would have been recognized as an operating expense in future periods 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america note 3 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contains a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

revenue we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers when title passes to the customer net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that they have resold the products to the end user although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

  

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products our actual returns and allowances do not fluctuate significantly from period to period and our returns and allowances provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 

  

freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense during the period in which they are incurred 

  

inventories  we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand projected end user demand is generally based on sales during the prior 12 months these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been 

  

written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2001 a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets additionally throughout 2003 2004 and 2005 no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized as of december 31 2005 and 2004 gross deferred tax assets were 6754 million and 6951 million respectively and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was 6692 million and 6946 million respectively our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 

  

impairment of longlived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value when material these gains are recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

  

goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary to date our goodwill has not been considered to be impaired based on the results of this first step 

  

defined benefit plans we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees all of these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans for example as of december 31 2005 a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately 28 million 

  

convertible redeemable preferred stock during the periods the convertible redeemable preferred stock was outstanding we accounted for the difference between the carrying amount of the convertible redeemable preferred stock and the redemption value by increasing the carrying amount for periodic accretion so that the 

  

carrying amount would equal the redemption value at the earliest available redemption date the periodic accretion amount changed as our stock price changed and as additional dividends accrued based on the average closing price of our common stock over the last 30 trading days preceding december 31 2003 of 619 the accretion charge in respect to the redemption feature for 2003 was 05 million we also recognized an additional accretion charge of 18 million during the first quarter of 2004 however due to declines in our stock price after the first quarter of 2004 the average closing price used in the accretion calculation at the end of each quarter was below the level that would result in accretion the average closing price of our common stock over the last 30 trading days preceding december 31 2004 was 4215 therefore the previously recognized accretion charges began to be reversed on a straightline basis through september 7 2009 unless future increases to our stock price required further accretion during 2004 previously recognized accretion charges of 03 million were reversed resulting in net accretion charges of 15 million during 2004 on november 10 2005 we entered into a conversion and termination agreement with tpg to convert the preferred stock into 49364080 shares of our common stock during 2005 previously recognized accretion charges of 10 million were reversed 

  

asset retirement obligations we recognize asset retirement obligations “aros” when incurred with the initial measurement at fair value these liabilities are accreted to full value over time through charges to income in addition asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset’s respective useful life our aros consist primarily of estimated decontamination costs associated with manufacturing equipment and buildings 

  

contingencies we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and estimable 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs — an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” sfas no 151 amends the guidance in arb no 43 chapter 4 “inventory pricing” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage paragraph 5 of arb 43 chapter 4 previously stated that “   under some circumstances items such as idle facility expense excessive spoilage double freight and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges    ” sfas no 151 requires that those items be recognized as currentperiod charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal” in addition this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the provisions of sfas no 151 are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 and shall be applied prospectively we adopted the provisions of sfas no 151 during the quarter ended september 30 2005 our early adoption of sfas no 151 resulted in no impact to our financial condition or results of operations 

  

in march 2005 the fasb issued fin 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations — an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” fin 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” “statement 143” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement thus the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event accordingly an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred — generally upon acquisition construction or development and or through the normal operation of the asset uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a 

  

conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists statement 143 acknowledges that in some cases sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation fin 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation fin 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 based on our evaluation of fin 47 we recorded a 29 net charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change upon adoption of fin 47 in 2005 and recorded a 40 million liability for asset retirement obligations included in other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet see note 4 accounting changes for further discussion 

  

in april 2005 the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that amends the compliance dates for fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” under the new rule sfas no 123r will become applicable to us beginning january 1 2006 we plan to adopt sfas no 123r using the modified prospective application method as defined by sfas no 123r and accordingly will begin recognizing compensation expense in the first quarter of 2006 in 2005 we began using a lattice model to calculate the fair value of options granted which will be used to determine stock compensation expense upon adoption of sfas no 123r see note 3 significant accounting policies for further discussion the adoption of sfas no 123r’s fair value method will have an estimated impact of a 20 million reduction to net income in the first quarter of 2006 and will have no impact on our overall financial position see note 11 stock options for further discussion due to the volatility of the price of our common stock and the uncertainty of future option grants to employees we are unable to estimate this expense for periods subsequent to the first quarter of 2006 

  

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections — a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” “sfas no 154” the guidance in opinion no 20 required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle this statement requires the retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so sfas no 154 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2005 our adoption of the provisions of sfas no 154 is not expected to impact our financial condition or results of operations 

  

in june 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position no 1431 “accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations” “fsp 1431” fsp 1431 addresses the accounting for obligations associated with directive 200296ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment “the directive” which was adopted by the european union under fsp 1431 any waste management obligation associated with the disposal of an asset will remain with the user until the waste equipment is replaced in the event that this occurs the waste management obligation for that asset may be transferred to the producer of the replacement equipment depending upon laws of the applicable european union member country the guidance in fsp 1431 shall be applied the later of the first reporting period ending after june 8 2005 or the date of the adoption of the law by the applicable eumember country our adoption of the provisions of fsp 1431 is not expected to impact our financial condition or results of operations 

  

in september 2005 the emerging issues task force reached consensus on eitf issue no 0413 “accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty” “issue no 0413” in certain situations a company may enter into nonmonetary transactions to sell inventory to another company in the same line of business from which it also purchases inventory under issue no 0413 in general an entity is required to treat sales and purchases of inventory between the entity and the same counterparty as one transaction for purposes of applying apb opinion no 29 “accounting for nonmonetary transactions” when such transactions are entered into in contemplation of each other when such transactions are legally contingent on each other they are considered to have been entered into in contemplation of each other the eitf also agreed on other factors that should be considered in determining whether transactions have been entered into in contemplation of each 

  

other issue no 0413 will be effective for all new arrangements entered into in reporting periods beginning after march 15 2006 our adoption of the provisions of issue no 0413 are not expected to impact our financial condition or results of operations 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

  

at december 31 2005 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 10670 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 3795 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 6875 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt however from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure as of december 31 2005 we had interest rate swaps covering 320 million of our variable interest rate debt a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately 18 million however some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents as a result of the higher rates 

  

on january 9 2003 we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility becomes less than 25 million 

  

a majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however as a multinational business we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments this strategy reduces but does not eliminate the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements for example changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules 13a15e and 15d15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded 

  

processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

change in internal control over financial reporting there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2005 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting  our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control — integrated framework  based on our assessment using those criteria we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2005 

  

our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” of this report 

  




 item 9b other information 

  

on november 10 2005 we entered into a conversion and termination agreement with tpg on holdings llc a delaware limited liability company “tpg on” an affiliate of tpg our largest stockholder to convert the preferred stock owned by tpg as provided for under the certificate of designations of series a cumulative convertible preferred stock as amended on june 15 2004 “certificate of designations” following such early conversion of tpg on’s preferred stock into our common stock none of the authorized shares of our preferred stock remained outstanding on february 17 2006 our board of directors resolved pursuant to delaware general corporation law section 151g that no series or class of the preferred stock will be issued under the certificate of designation and authorized the filing of a certificate of elimination for the certificate of designation with the secretary of state of the state of delaware upon the filing of this certificate of elimination the former tpg on shares of preferred stock became authorized but unissued and may be reissued as part of another series

we have four main product lines power management and standard analog devices metal oxide semiconductor mos power devices high frequency clock and data management devices and standard components our extensive portfolio of devices enables us to offer advanced integrated circuits and the “building block” components that deliver system level functionality and design solutions our product portfolio currently comprises approximately 17000 products and we shipped approximately 254 billion units in 2003 we specialize in micro packages which offer increased performance characteristics while reducing the critical board space inside today’s ever shrinking electronic devices we believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products provides our customers with single source purchasing on a costeffective and timely basis 

  

we have approximately 200 direct customers worldwide and we also service approximately 300 significant original equipment manufacturers indirectly through our distributor and electronic manufacturing service provider customers our direct and indirect customers include 1 leading original equipment manufacturers in a broad variety of industries such as alcatel intel motorola nokia philips siemens and sony 2 electronic manufacturing service providers such as flextronics jabil and solectron and 3 global distributors such as arrow avnet ebv elektronik future solomon enterprise and world peace 

  

we currently have design operations in arizona rhode island texas china the czech republic and france and we currently operate manufacturing facilities in arizona rhode island china the czech republic japan malaysia the philippines and slovakia 

  

immediately prior to our august 4 1999 recapitalization we were a whollyowned subsidiary of motorola inc we held and continue to hold through direct and indirect subsidiaries substantially all of the assets and operations of the semiconductor components group of motorola’s semiconductor products sector as a result of the recapitalization an affiliate of texas pacific group owned approximately 91 and motorola owned approximately 9 of our outstanding common stock in addition as part of the recapitalization texas pacific group received 1500 shares and motorola received 590 shares of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation value of 2090 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends motorola also received a 910 million junior subordinated note due 2011 issued by semiconductor components industries llc our primary domestic operating subsidiary cash payments to motorola in connection with the recapitalization were financed through equity investments by affiliates of texas pacific group totaling 3375 million borrowings totaling 7405 million under our 8750 million senior bank facilities and the issuance of 4000 million of 12 senior subordinated notes due august 2009 because texas pacific group’s affiliate did not acquire substantially all of 

  

our common stock the recapitalization did not impact the basis of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes at the time of the recapitalization motorola agreed to provide us with transition and manufacturing services in order to facilitate our transition to a standalone company independent of motorola 

  

on april 3 2000 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of cherry semiconductor corporation for 2532 million in cash including acquisition related costs which we financed with cash on hand and borrowings of 2200 million under our senior bank facilities cherry semiconductor corporation which we have renamed semiconductor components industries of rhode island inc designs and manufactures analog and mixed signal integrated circuits for the power management and automotive markets 

  

on may 3 2000 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock selling 345 million shares with an issue price of 16 per share net proceeds from the initial public offering after deducting issuance costs were approximately 5148 million the net proceeds were used to redeem all outstanding preferred stock including accrued dividends redeem a portion of the senior subordinated notes and prepay a portion of the loans outstanding under the senior bank facilities see note 11 “common stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report 

  

on september 7 2001 we obtained 1000 million 992 million net of issuance costs through an equity investment by an affiliate of texas pacific group our principal shareholder in this transaction we issued 10000 shares of mandatorily redeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock this investment was required because we were not in compliance with certain minimum interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants under our senior bank facilities see note 7 “longterm debt” and note 10 “redeemable preferred stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in each case included elsewhere in this report 

  

since our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors we reduced our total debt and interest expense as a result of two recent public offerings of common stock in september 2003 and february 2004 a portion of the proceeds from which we applied to prepay and redeem a portion of our outstanding debt prior to scheduled maturity during 2002 and 2003 we engaged in several debt refinancing transactions which extended a portion of our debt maturities some of the transactions that extended our debt maturities also resulted in an increase in our overall interest expense and others lowered our overall interest expense in connection with these transactions we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things make our financial covenants less restrictive on the whole see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 7 “longterm debt” and note 11 “common stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details on these financing activities 

  

since the fourth quarter of 2000 we have been implementing a profitability enhancement program to improve our cost structure and as a result we expect to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure as a result of the elements of this program that we started in june 2001 and completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 the 2000 plan we achieved approximately 365 million of annualized cost savings based on a comparison of our cost structure during the first quarter of 2001 to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002 as a result of additional cost cutting commenced in the fourth quarter of 2002 which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2003 the 2002 plan we believe that we achieved an estimated 114 million of cost savings in 2003 as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002 and we expect to achieve an estimated 151 million of annual costs savings beginning in 2004 from the 2002 plan these savings are as a result of our manufacturing rationalization plan reductions in nonmanufacturing personnel and other cost controls our manufacturing rationalization plan included movement of our manufacturing operations from high cost regions in north america to lower cost regions in asia and central europe as a result approximately 79 of our cost of goods sold in 2003 related to our manufacturing operations outside of north america more recently we announced that we intend to phase out our manufacturing operations in east greenwich ri and our assembly and test operations in the czech republic we estimate these activities will be complete by the end of 2004

customers 

  

we have been doing business with 46 of our 50 largest customers for more than five years sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply but do not require minimum purchase commitments most of our original equipment manufacturer customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year while our other customers generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of end markets computing automotive electronics consumer electronics industrial electronics wireless communications and networking sales to our largest customers arrow avnet and motorola accounted for approximately 9 13 and 7 respectively of our total revenue during 2003 as compared to 10 10 and 8 during 2002 

  

we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of 1 three years from the date of shipment or 2 the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge warranty expense to date has been minimal generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog” below 

  

the following table sets forth our principal enduser markets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our total revenues generated from each enduser market during 2003 sample applications for our products and representative original equipment manufacturer customers and end users 

  

end markets for our products 

  

   

original equipment manufacturers direct sales to original equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately 42 of our revenues in 2003 approximately 48 in 2002 and approximately 47 in 2001 these customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as alcatel intel motorola nokia philips siemens and sony and in the automotive industry such as daimlerchrysler delphi trw and visteon we focus on three types of original equipment manufacturers multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core original equipment manufacturer customers the target market customers in the communications power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are original equipment manufacturers that are on the leading edge of specific technologies 

  

and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

  

distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 47 of our revenues in 2003 approximately 41 in 2002 and approximately 43 in 2001 our distributors which include arrow avnet ebv elektronik future solomon enterprise and world peace resell to midsized and smaller original equipment manufacturers and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book or that is more than four years older than the manufacturing code date in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product sales returns have minimal impact on our profits 

  

electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 11 of our revenues in 2003 approximately 11 in 2002 and approximately 10 in 2001 our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are flextronics jabil and solectron these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many original equipment manufacturers now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace 

  

manufacturing operations 

  

we operate our manufacturing facilities either directly or through a joint venture five of these are frontend wafer facilities located in japan slovakia malaysia and the united states three are backend assembly and test facilities located in china malaysia and the philippines and one is an integrated frontend and backend facility located in the czech republic in addition to these manufacturing and assembly operations our facility in roznov czech republic manufactures raw wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 

  

during 2001 we decided to shut down our integrated facility in guadalajara mexico and transfer the frontend and backend manufacturing to other owned and contracted locations accordingly the guadalajara mexico facility ceased operations in the second quarter of 2002 and was sold in the third quarter of 2003 in november 2003 we announced our decision to discontinue our assembly and test operations at our site in roznov czech republic and move these operations to our facility in seremban malaysia and to contract manufacturers in december 2003 we announced our decision to phase out manufacturing operations at our facility in east greenwich ri we estimate this closure will be complete by the end of 2004 we plan to transfer most of the production of this facility to our lower cost manufacturing facilities outside of north america and the balance to lower cost contract manufacturers 

  

the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the products produced at these facilities the sizes of the locations represent the approximate gross square feet of each site’s building and include among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 

  

   

our operations in the czech republic are held through a publicly traded czech company of which we owned approximately 90 of the outstanding equity interests as of december 31 2003 we purchased 100 95 and 88 of the raw wafer output in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively and purchased the entire output of the integrated facility for all three years in 2001 we entered into a new sevenyear agreement with this subsidiary pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase minimum amounts of product based on our forecasted quarterly requirements 

  

we operate a backend manufacturing facility in leshan china we own this facility through a joint venture company leshanphoenix semiconductor company ltd of which we owned a majority of the outstanding equity interests as of december 31 2003 our joint venture partner leshan radio company ltd is a formerly stateowned enterprise pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment we committed to purchase 82 85 and 81 of leshan’s production capacity in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively and are currently committed to purchase 86 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2004 in 2003 2002 and 2001 we incurred 05 million 15 million and 64 million in underutilization charges respectively as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan we supply die used in the production process 

  

the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations and we anticipate that any future expansion of our manufacturing capacity would involve this facility including the previously announced start of construction in august 2002 of a 6inch wafer fabrication facility in june 2002 we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to 231 million in semiconductor operations which is in addition to the 278 million originally approved we have the ability to pace these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand and therefore expect these investments to occur gradually over time 

  

our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we have no material agreements with any of our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in come cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship these contract manufacturers including amkor psi ait ase kec hynix liteon chartered and phenitec accounted for approximately 26 30 and 31 of our cost of sales in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the reductions in the use of thirdparty contractors reflect our efforts to improve internal capacity utilization under our manufacturing rationalization plan 

  

we entered into an agreement with motorola to continue to provide manufacturing services to each other for limited periods of time following our 1999 recapitalization we negotiated fixed prices with motorola for the services covered by these agreements to approximate each party’s cost of providing the services for 2003 2002 and 2001 motorola purchased 34 million 14 million and 82 million respectively of manufacturing services from us with no minimum purchase commitments going forward at this time these purchases are classified as revenues in our financial statements we purchased 89 million 143 million and 874 million of manufacturing services from motorola in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively fulfilling our minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from motorola during such periods we currently have no minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from motorola 

  

sales marketing and distribution 

  

as of december 31 2003 our global sales and marketing organization consists of approximately 406 professionals operating out of approximately 45 offices and serving customers in 37 countries we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective internetbased applications support from our laboratories in the czech republic china and the united states through online connectivity applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions pursuant to our restructuring programs we have downsized our sales force by approximately 230 employees closed approximately 20 of our sales offices and in some regions converted sales personnel to sales representatives in addition we have centralized and relocated our order entry functions to low cost locations motorola agreed to provide us with worldwide shipping and freight services for a period of up to three years following our 1999 recapitalization this resulted in better prices than we could obtain from third parties cost increases resulting from the termination of the shipping and freight service agreement in july 2002 were estimated to be approximately 11 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 we have negotiated improved freight agreements and changed some logistic flows to offset some of the increase in our 2003 total freight costs 

  










 item 2 properties 

  

in the united states our corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing research and development and warehouse operations are located in approximately 18 million square feet of space in properties that we own in phoenix arizona and east greenwich rhode island we also lease properties around the world for use as sales offices research and development labs warehouses logistic centers and trading offices the size andor location of these properties change from time to time based on business requirements we operate distribution centers which are leased or contracted through a third party in locations throughout asia europe and the americas we own our manufacturing facilities in the united states japan malaysia the philippines slovakia and the czech republic these facilities are primarily manufacturing operations but also include office utility laboratory facilities warehouse and unused space our joint venture in leshan china also owns manufacturing warehouse laboratory office and unused space 

  

in november 2003 we announced our decision to discontinue our assembly and test operations at our site in roznov czech republic and move these operations to our facility in seremban malaysia and to contract manufacturers in december 2003 we announced our decision to phase out manufacturing operations at our facility in east greenwich ri we estimate this closure will be complete by the end of 2004 we plan to transfer most of the production of this facility to our lower cost manufacturing facilities outside of north america and the balance to lower cost contract manufacturers resulting in an expected reduction of 330 jobs 

  

as part of our 1999 recapitalization motorola conveyed to us the surface rights to a portion of the land located at our phoenix facility excluding the subsurface rights and conveyed buildings located at the phoenix facility these buildings do not include any treatment facilities relating to motorola’s environmental cleanup operations at the phoenix facility we executed a declaration of covenants easements and restrictions with motorola providing access easements for the parties and granting to us options to purchase or to lease the subsurface rights of the land motorola leased approximately 70000 square feet of space at our phoenix facility pursuant to an agreement that expired in june 2003 motorola ceased manufacturing at our phoenix facility during 2002 and substantially removed their equipment material and personnel from the site as of december 31 2002 

  

we believe that our facilities around the world whether owned or leased are well maintained we believe that we have sufficient access to productive capacity to meet our needs for the majority of the products in our business lines for the foreseeable future 

  

we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and similar assets of each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries but no more than 65 of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries held by them to secure our senior bank facilities first lien secured notes and second lien secured notes 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on information currently available management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters including the matters described in the next paragraphs will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

during the period july 5 2001 through july 27 2001 we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our former 

  

officers current and former directors and the underwriters for our initial public offering the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york as abrams v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv6114 breuer v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv6287 and cohen v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv6942 on april 19 2002 the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint alleges among other things that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately 300 other publicly traded companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city which have all been transferred along with the case against us to a single federal district judge for purposes of coordinated case management we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended and intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously the litigation process is inherently uncertain however and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us 

  

on july 15 2002 together with the other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them in addition the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual former officers and current and former directors who were named as defendants in our litigation and they are no longer parties to the litigation on february 19 2003 the court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants in that ruling the court granted in part and denied in part those motions as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws the court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to replead these claims as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded the court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well the court also denied the underwriter defendants’ motion to dismiss in all respects 

  

in june 2003 upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation if ultimately approved by the court this proposed settlement would result in a dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elect to participate in the proposed settlement together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants the proposed settlement does not provide for the resolution of any claims against the underwriter defendants and the litigation against those defendants is continuing the proposed settlement provides that the class members in the class action cases brought against the participating issuer defendants will be guaranteed a recovery of 1 billion by the participating issuer defendants if recoveries totaling less than 1 billion are obtained by the class members from the underwriter defendants the class members will be entitled to recover the difference between 1 billion and the aggregate amount of those recoveries from the participating issuer defendants if recoveries totaling 1 billion or more are obtained by the class members from the underwriter defendants however the monetary obligations to the class members under the proposed settlement will be satisfied in addition we and any other participating issuer defendants will be required to assign to the class members certain claims that we may have against the underwriters of our initial public offerings 

  

the proposed settlement contemplates that any amounts necessary to fund the settlement or settlementrelated expenses would come from participating issuers’ directors and officers’ liability insurance policy proceeds as opposed to funds of the participating issuer defendants themselves a participating issuer defendant could be required to contribute to the costs of the settlement if that issuer’s insurance coverage were insufficient 

  

to pay that issuer’s allocable share of the settlement costs we expect that our insurance proceeds will be sufficient for these purposes and that we will not otherwise be required to contribute to the proposed settlement consummation of the proposed settlement is conditioned upon among other things negotiating executing and filing with the court final settlement documents and final approval by the court formal settlement documents for submission to the court are currently being drafted if the proposed settlement described above is not consummated however we intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously while we can make no promises or guarantees as to the outcome of these proceedings we believe that the final result of these actions will have no material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

executive overview 

  

this section presents summary information regarding our industry markets and operating trends only for further information regarding the events summarized herein you should read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in its entirety 

  

industry overview 

  

worldwide semiconductor industry sales were 1664 billion in 2003 an increase of 183 from 2002 we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by the world semiconductor trade statistics group to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market since 2000 

  

     

following the unprecedented semiconductor industry revenue declines of 2001 the semiconductor industry began to show signs of stability in 2002 and grew more robust in 2003 worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by 12 in 2002 and 183 in 2003 sales in our total addressable market grew by 25 in 2002 and 144 in 2003 reflecting increases in volume and slowing rates of price declines during the latter part of the 2003 

  

the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately 15 during 2002 through 2005 these are projections and may not be indicative of actual results other industry data also indicate that the market for our products has begun to expand after the recent and prolonged downturn 

  

business overview 

  

we classify our products broadly as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components we design manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products our power management semiconductor components control convert protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices our data management semiconductor components provide highperformance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all electronic devices these various products fall into the logic analog and discrete categories used by wsts 

  

historically the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical during a down cycle unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem resulting in revenue declines in response to such declines manufacturers have shut down production capacity when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again as market unit demand has reached levels above capacity production capabilities shortages have begun to occur which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers thus prompting further capacity expansion such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand which has triggered another similar cycle 

  

we believe we have entered into a cycle of rising volume and prices as our manufacturing capacity utilization has increased to over 85 our booktobill ratio has exceeded 1 in each quarter of 2003 and we have been able to selectively increase prices on some products where there are market shortages 

  

these recent trends are in sharp contrast to the last three years during which we had to consistently reduce our costs in order to generate sufficient cash flow to fund investments in new products and expand production capabilities in lower cost areas of the world 

  

cost savings and restructuring activities 

  

since the fourth quarter of 2000 we have been implementing profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and as a result we expect to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure as a result of the elements of a program that we started in june 2001 and completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 the 2000 plan we achieved approximately 365 million of annualized cost savings based on a comparison of our cost structure during the first quarter of 2001 to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002 as a result of additional cost cutting commenced in the fourth quarter of 2002 which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2003 the 2002 plan we believe that we achieved an estimated 114 million of cost savings in 2003 as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002 and we expect to achieve an estimated 151 million of annual costs savings beginning in 2004 from the 2002 plan these savings are as a result of our manufacturing rationalization plan reductions in nonmanufacturing personnel and other cost controls our manufacturing rationalization plan included movement of our manufacturing operations from high cost regions in north america to lower cost regions in asia and central europe as a result approximately 79 of our cost of goods sold in 2003 related to our manufacturing operations outside of north america more recently we announced that we intend to phase out our manufacturing operations in east greenwich ri and our assembly and test operations in the czech republic by the end of 2004 

  

new product innovation 

  

as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives we introduced 176 new products in 2002 and 260 new products in 2003 the primary emphasis of our new product development efforts is on power management and high frequency clock and data management solutions which we expect to be among the highest 

  

margin product families within our portfolio the portion of our revenue attributable to new products has increased over the last three years even though our overall revenue has declined during this period we define new product revenue as revenue from the sale of products that we have introduced in the three years prior to and during the period measured 

  

debt reduction and financing activities 

  

since we became an independent company as a result of our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors our longterm debt includes significant amounts under our senior bank facilities which contained minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio covenants with which we were not in compliance as of june 29 2001 we obtained a waiver in respect of such noncompliance and any future noncompliance through 2002 and amended our senior bank facilities to make these covenants less restrictive through 2005 however in connection with such waiver and amendment we added minimum cash and ebitda covenants and agreed to pay additional supplemental interest and obtain a 100 million equity investment from our principal stockholder 

  

during 2002 and the first half of 2003 we completed two debt refinancing transactions and further amended our senior bank facilities in connection therewith to extend a portion of our debt maturities reduce the supplemental interest associated with our 2001 bank amendment and make the related financial covenants less restrictive on the whole we issued 300 million principal amount of second lien senior secured notes due 2008 and 200 million principal amount of first lien senior secured notes due 2010 the net proceeds of which were used to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities we incurred 227 million of offering expenses and increased our weighted average cost of borrowing as a result in addition as part of the related amendments to our senior bank facilities we converted 625 million of our 125 million revolving facility into a new term loan facility 

  

during the second half of 2003 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt reduce the related interest costs and in some cases extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility in september 2003 we issued approximately 370 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 450 per share the net proceeds of which were used to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities in connection with this offering we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things extend the average maturity of the term loans through a refinancing of 100 million of such loans and replace our 625 million revolving facility with a new 250 million revolving facility 

  

in november 2003 we further amended our senior bank facilities to among other things reduce the interest rate on our outstanding term loans by 075 in november 2003 we extended the maturity of our 200 million loan facility with a chinese bank for an additional three years under the same terms and conditions in december 2003 we prepaid approximately 480 million of loans under our senior bank facilities with the proceeds from a new loan facility with a chinese bank that bears interest at libor plus 15 as compared to libor plus 325 under our senior bank facilities 

  

in february 2004 we further reduced our longterm debt as result of our sale of approximately 344 million shares at a public offering price of 698 per share the net proceeds of which were used to redeem 70 million principal amount of our first lien senior secured notes due 2010 and 105 million principal amount of our second lien senior secured notes due 2008 at a redemption price of 112 of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes in connection with the offering we further amended our senior bank facilities to permit us to use the proceeds of this offering within 270 days of completion to purchase redeem or retire a portion of our senior subordinated notes due 2009 and our first lien senior secured notes and second lien senior secured notes 

  

the details of each of these financing events are outlined in the following sections also see note 7 “longterm debt” note 10 “redeemable preferred stock” and note 11 “common stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

outlook 

  

based upon booking trends backlog levels and estimated turns levels we anticipate that revenues for the first quarter of 2004 will increase by 5 to 6 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of 2004 were higher than backlog levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2003 and represented greater than 90 of our anticipated revenues for the first quarter of 2004 we expect that average selling prices for the first quarter of 2004 will increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 and that our gross margin for the first quarter of 2004 will increase to between 29 and 30 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 the amounts in the following table are in millions except for percentage changes

revenues 

  

revenues were 10691 million 10937 million and 12232 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decline from 2001 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2003 were primarily due to declines in average selling prices of approximately 10 and 14 respectively in each case partially offset by volume and mix changes as previously described during 2001 and continuing through the first part of 2003 the decline in average selling prices was due to overcapacity and lower demand in the semiconductor industry the revenues by product line are as follows dollars in millions 

  

    

although revenues from our power management and standard analog product line declined from 2001 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2003 revenues in this product line as a percentage of total revenues increased from 2001 to 2002 as a result of our strategic focus of research and development and marketing efforts on the power management market in 2003 weakness in the automotive sector has contributed to the absolute dollar and percentage declines in this product line 

  

revenues from mos power devices declined from 2001 to 2002 but increased in 2003 to exceed 2001 levels as a percentage of revenues this product line grew in each of 2002 and 2003 as compared to the previous year primarily as a result of revenues from successful new product designs and strength in the computing sector 

  

revenues from high frequency clock and data management products declined substantially between 2001 and 2002 due to weakness in the networking sector driven by an excessive supply of routing and networking equipment in 2003 this sector started to grow again primarily in the automated test equipment market causing an increase in revenues both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 

  

revenue from standard components declined steadily from 2001 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2003 this product line consists of many products that are available from numerous competitors in the marketplace and is thus heavily influenced by pricing pressures and general market conditions in addition we took steps in 2002 to exit nonprofitable portions of this business accounting for a portion of the revenue decline between 2002 and 2003 the revenue declines from 2001 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2003 are also partially attributable to our focus on other product lines during these periods 

  

revenues by geographic area as a percentage of revenues were as follows 

  

   

a majority of our end customers served directly or through distribution channels are manufacturers of electronic devices in recent years there has been a trend toward moving such manufacturing activities to lower cost regions particularly in asia our shift in revenues by geographic area reflects this trend 

  

gross profit 

  

our gross profit was 3010 million 2981 million and 2255 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively as a percentage of revenues our gross margin was 282 273 and 184 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively although declines in average selling prices had a detrimental impact on our gross margin during 2002 and 2003 and reduced the need for inventory reserves in 2002 and 2003 we were able to offset these effects through cost savings from our restructuring programs and the reduced need for inventory reserves in 2002 and 2003 

  

since the fourth quarter of 2000 we have been implementing profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and as a result we expect to rank as compared to our primary competitors among the lowest in terms of cost structure as a result of the elements of a program that we started in june 2001 and completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 the 2000 plan we achieved approximately 365 million of annualized cost savings of which 255 million related to cost of sales based on a comparison of our cost structure during the first quarter of 2001 to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002 as a result of additional cost cutting commenced in the fourth quarter of 2002 which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2003 the 2002 plan we believe that we achieved an estimated 114 million of cost savings in 2003 as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002 and we expect to achieve an estimated 151 million of annual costs savings beginning in 2004 from the 2002 plan these savings are as a result of our manufacturing rationalization plan reductions in nonmanufacturing personnel and other cost controls our manufacturing rationalization plan included movement of our manufacturing operations from high cost regions in north america to lower cost regions in asia and central europe as a result approximately 79 of our cost of goods sold in 2003 related to our manufacturing operations outside of north america more recently we announced that we intend to phase out our manufacturing operations in east greenwich ri and our assembly and test operations in the czech republic by the end of 2004 as a result of these actions we expect to achieve modest savings in 2004 as operations transition to other manufacturing facilities during 2005 we expect cost savings related to these closures to be between 20 million and 25 million as compared to annualized costs in the third quarter of 2003 

  

the following table summarizes the annual cost savings from the 2000 plan by type and by the applicable caption contained in our consolidated statement of operations in millions 

  

   

the following table summarizes the estimated annual cost savings from the 2002 plan that we expect following 2003 by type of cost and by the applicable caption contained in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in millions 

  

   

the actions taken to achieve the cost savings described above were centered around the following key initiatives which we expect to continue to be a focus in 2004 

  

   

   

   

   

   

these plans have included among other actions phasing out manufacturing operations at our guadalajara mexico facility and transferring some of the manufacturing activities performed at our aizu japan and seremban malaysia facilities to some of our other facilities or to third party contractors more recently we announced that we intend to phase out our manufacturing operations in east greenwich ri and our assembly and test operations in the czech republic by the end of 2004 in many cases the volume from closed operations has been or is being shifted to our existing facilities in order to improve capacity utilization and take advantage of economies of scale facilities closures and production shifts have resulted in some reductions in our manufacturing capacity but we do not expect these reductions to affect our ability to meet our foreseeable production needs 

  

operating expenses 

  

research and development expenses were 855 million 815 million and 945 million representing 80 75 and 77 of revenues in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the primary emphasis of our new product development efforts has been and continues to be in the expected high growth market applications of power management and high frequency clock and data management solutions with over 70 of our overall research and development investments focused in these areas 

  

selling and marketing expenses were 630 million 612 million and 748 million representing 59 56 and 61 of revenues in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively restructuring efforts in selling and marketing including the downsizing of our sales force closing of sales offices as well as our regional sales headquarters and centralizing and relocating our order entry functions to lower cost regions were largely enacted by the middle of 2001 internal sales and marketing personnel and field application engineers as well as external sales representatives promote our products we plan to make investments in our sales and marketing systems to identify new customers as well as to expand our penetration of existing customers in selected product areas 

  

general and administrative expenses were 649 million 888 million and 1155 million representing 61 81 and 94 of revenues in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively personnel reductions of approximately 30 and the relocation of functions to lower cost regions accounted for the majority of the decrease between 2001 and 2002 savings from these efforts as well as continued personnel reductions and functional relocations accounted for the further decrease between 2002 and 2003 based on our revenue estimates for 2004 and the fact that most of our cost savings in this area have been realized we expect that any further decreases in general and administrative expenses would be modest and would be primarily attributable to our transition to new information technology platforms 

  

amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was 59 million 119 million and 226 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively as a result of the adoption of sfas no 142 effective january 1 2002 we eliminated the amortization of goodwill see note 3 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report as discussed in further detail below amortization of our developed technology intangible asset ceased following the second quarter of 2003 when we wroteoff the remaining balance acquired in connection with our acquisition of cherry semiconductor in april 2000 

  

other operating expenses — restructuring asset impairments and other 

  

restructuring asset impairments and other charges were 612 million 277 million and 1504 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively our individual quarterly restructuring charges are summarized below however for more information see note 5 “restructuring asset impairments and other net” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 1511 million 1525 million and 1436 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase between 2001 and 2002 was attributable to the increased supplemental interest charges resulting from our august 2001 amendments to our senior bank facilities and a full year of interest on the draw on our revolving credit facility that occurred in june 2001 this supplemental interest ceased to accrue at the end of march 2003 however the resulting interest savings was offset by our refinancing of portions of our senior bank facilities with higher interest rate bearing notes see “liquidity and capital resources — “financing” for a description of our refinancing activities our weightedaverage interest rate on longterm debt including current maturities was 108 105 and 103 per annum in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

loss on debt prepayment 

  

loss on debt prepayment totaled 77 million and 65 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively representing the writeoff of debt issuance costs and certain thirdparty costs incurred with respect to debt refinancings that occurred during those periods see “liquidity and capital resources — financing” for a description of our refinancing activities in the first quarter of 2004 we expect to incur an additional 330 million loss on debt prepayment associated with the repayment of a portion of our first lien senior secured notes due 2010 and second lien senior secured notes due 2008 in connection with our february 2004 equity offering

provision for income taxes was 77 million 95 million and 3458 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the 2003 and 2002 provisions related to income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations the 2001 amount was greatly influenced by our decision to reserve the deferred tax benefits relating to our domestic net operating losses to the amount that could be recovered via carryback this decision resulted in an increase of 3668 million in our valuation allowance that was partially offset by deferred tax benefits recognized for certain operating losses incurred outside the united states 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements our sources and uses of cash our debt and debt covenants and our management of cash 

  

cash requirements 

  

commercial commitments contractual obligations and indemnities 

  

our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our senior bank facilities other longterm debt operating leases purchase obligations pension obligations and our redeemable preferred stock the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future 

  

   

our longterm debt includes 3201 million under senior bank facilities 1916 million of senior secured notes net of unamortized discount due 2010 2926 million of senior secured notes net of unamortized discount due 2008 2600 million of senior subordinated notes due 2009 1399 million under the junior subordinated note 243 million under a note payable to a japanese bank 200 million under a loan facility with a chinese bank 480 million under a loan facility with another chinese bank and 64 million of capital lease obligations see note 7 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

in the normal course of our business we enter into various operating leases for equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment 

  

our other longterm commitments consist of estimated payments relating to our us and foreign pension plans see note 13 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report under our current assumptions we expect pension expense to be approximately 5 million over the remaining life of the us plan with a related cash funding requirement of 

  

approximately 30 million upon the termination of the us pension plan we are under an obligation to ensure that the plan has assets sufficient to pay accrued benefits the remaining obligation in the table above also includes approximately 10 million of estimated funding requirements for our foreign pension plans 

  

our series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock is redeemable at the holder’s option anytime after september 7 2009 the preferred stock has a cumulative dividend payable quarterly in cash at the rate of 80 per annum or if greater during the relevant quarterly period in an amount equal to the value of the dividends that would be paid on the common stock then issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock compounded to the extent not paid and subject to restrictions under the company’s senior bank facilities senior subordinated notes and other documents relating to the company’s indebtedness the amount shown in the table above assumes no conversion of the preferred stock or redemption until the earliest redemption date of september 7 2009 we are required to accrete the value of the preferred stock to its redemption value and any resulting noncash charge would reduce net income applicable to common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share as a result net income applicable to common stock may be reduced by any such noncash charges resulting from changes in the market price of our common stock for further information see note 10 “redeemable preferred stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 1866 million at december 31 2003 we believe we have sufficient cash to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months our senior bank facilities include a 250 million revolving facility letters of credit totaling 126 million were outstanding under the revolving facility at december 31 2003 we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than 25 million 

  

we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to intellectual property infringement property damage including environmental contamination personal injury failure to comply with applicable laws our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 

  

we are a party to various agreements with motorola a former affiliate which were entered into in connection with our separation from motorola pursuant to these agreements we have agreed to indemnify motorola for losses due to for example breach of representations and warranties and covenants damages arising from assumed liabilities or relating to allocated assets and for specified environmental matters our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time andor amount and payment by us is conditioned on motorola making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract which procedures typically allow us to challenge motorola’s claims 

  

we provide for indemnification of directors officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements certificates of incorporation bylaws articles of association or similar organizational documents as the case may be we maintain directors’ and officers’ insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 

  

in addition to the above from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provides indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 

  

while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to 

  

predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements including outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand and targeted asset sales additionally as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 

  

we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include 

  

   

   

our ability to service our longterm debt to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may beyond our control 

  

if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash balances will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through december 31 2004 to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted 

  

operations 

  

our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash and our management of our assets and liabilities including both working capital and longterm assets and liabilities each of these components is discussed herein 

  

ebitda 

  

earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” is a key indicator that management uses to evaluate our operating performance while ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow 

  

from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity it is included herein to provide additional information with respect to our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditure and working capital requirements this calculation may differ in method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies the following table sets forth our ebitda for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 with a reconciliation to cash flows from operations the most directly comparable financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles 

  

      

as a result of the industry downturn in 2001 ebitda for 2001 was negative 1689 million ebitda for 2002 improved to 1657 million primarily as a result of cost savings resulting from our restructuring initiatives and reduced restructuring asset impairment and other charges of 1227 million in 2002 compared to 2001 ebitda for 2003 declined to 1179 million primarily as a result of the restructuring asset impairment and other net charges in 2003 that were 335 million higher than those in 2002 and a cumulative effect of accounting change of 215 million in 2003 

  

as discussed in note 7 “longterm debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report our debt covenants require us to maintain minimum adjusted ebitda levels as defined by our credit agreement this adjusted ebitda computation excludes certain restructuring and other charges and contains other differences from the ebitda as defined above therefore ebitda in the above table is not representative of the adjusted ebitda used to determine our debt covenant compliance 

  

working capital 

  

working capital fluctuates depending on endmarket demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables inventory and payables in times of escalating demand our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs which may require us to use cash for severance payments asset transfers and contract termination costs our working capital including cash was 2125 million at december 31 2003 and has fluctuated within 10 percent of this balance at quarterend for each of the last eight quarters 

  

the components of our working capital at december 31 2003 and 2002 are set forth below followed by explanations for changes between 2002 and 2003 that are greater than 5 million 

  

   

the increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributable to an increase in sales during the last two months of 2003 as compared to the last two months of 2002 revenue growth could cause further growth in our receivable portfolio unless such growth can be offset by reduced credit terms or improved collection rates 

  

the increase in inventory is attributable to an increase in production at the end of 2003 necessitated by increased backlog improved demand could cause a further increase in inventory if we expand production in response 

  

the decrease in other current assets in 2003 is primarily due to the accelerated settlement of certain value added tax vat amounts in europe and other claims as well as a reduction in prepaid items due to favorable vendor contract negotiations 

  

the increase in accounts payable in 2003 relates to our efforts to extend payment terms with our significant suppliers as well as an increase in production at the end of 2003 continued growth in the semiconductor market could cause a reversal in this trend of extended payment terms as we compete with other semiconductor manufacturers for access to production materials 

  

the decrease in accrued expenses is attributable to a decrease in restructuring related reserves as we continue to make severance and contract termination payments and the accelerated settlement of certain vat payables in europe described above 

  

the decrease in accrued interest is attributable to the payment of supplemental interest of 269 million in the first quarter of 2003 of which a majority was outstanding at december 31 2002 partially offset by accruals associated with our first lien senior secured notes interest payable semiannually in march and september and prepayment of loans under of our senior bank facilities with the proceeds thereof the effect of this refinancing activity is further described in the “financing activities” below 

  

the decrease in current portion of longterm debt relates to the effects of our 2003 refinancing activities as described in “financing activities” below 

  

longterm assets and liabilities 

  

our longterm assets consist primarily of property plant and equipment intangible assets and capitalized debt issuance costs 

  

our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to efficiently utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently accordingly we have reduced our capital expenditures during 2002 and 2003 we do not expect that our capital expenditure reductions will have a negative impact on our ability to service our customers as we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties capital expenditures were 598 million 405 million and 1490 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively during 2003 there was an excess supply of used semiconductor production equipment in the marketplace and we were able to purchase additional equipment at discounted prices we will continue to look for opportunities to make similar strategic purchases in the future as we plan to invest approximately 80 million in 2004 for additional capacity although our debt covenants contain certain restrictions that limit our amount of future capital expenditures we do not believe that these restrictions will have a significant impact on our future operating performance 

  

our longterm liabilities excluding longterm debt consist primarily of liabilities under our foreign and domestic defined benefit pension plans our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum legal required amount in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate this annual amount is dependent upon many actuarial assumptions — see note 13 “employee benefit plans” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

key financing events 

  

overview 

  

set forth below is a summary of the key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years 

  

since we became an independent company as a result of our 1999 recapitalization we have had relatively high levels of longterm debt as compared to our principal competitors our longterm debt includes significant amounts under our senior bank facilities which contained minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio covenants with which we were not in compliance as of june 29 2001 we obtained a waiver in respect of such noncompliance and any future noncompliance through 2002 and amended our senior bank facilities to make these covenants less restrictive through 2005 however in connection with such waiver and amendment we added minimum cash and ebitda covenants and agreed to pay additional supplemental interest and obtain a 100 million equity investment from our principal stockholder 

  

during 2002 and the first half of 2003 we completed two debt refinancing transactions and further amended our senior bank facilities in connection therewith to extend a portion of our debt maturities reduce the supplemental interest associated with our 2001 bank amendment and make the related financial covenants less restrictive on the whole we issued 300 million principal amount of second lien senior secured notes due 2008 and 200 million principal amount of first lien senior secured notes due 2010 the net proceeds of which were used to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities we incurred 227 million of offering expenses and increased our weighted average cost of borrowing as a result in addition as part of the related amendments to our senior bank facilities we converted 625 million of our 125 million revolving facility into a new term loan facility 

  

during the second half of 2003 we began undertaking measures to reduce our longterm debt reduce related interest costs and in some cases extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility in september 2003 we issued approximately 370 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 450 per share the net proceeds of which were used to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities in connection with this offering we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things extend the average maturity of the term loans through a refinancing of 100 million of such loans and replace our 625 million revolving facility with a new 250 million revolving facility 

  

in november 2003 we further amended our senior bank facilities to among other things reduce the interest rate on our outstanding term loans by 075 in november 2003 we extended the maturity of our 200 million loan facility with a chinese bank for an additional three years under the same terms and conditions in december 2003 we prepaid approximately 480 million of loans under our senior bank facilities with the proceeds from a new loan facility with a chinese bank that bears interest at libor plus 15 as compared to libor plus 325 under our senior bank facilities 

  

in the first quarter of 2004 we expect to further reduce our longterm debt as a result of the sale of approximately 344 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 698 per share the net proceeds are expected to be used to redeem 70 million principal amount of our first lien senior secured notes due 2010 and 105 million principal amount of our second lien senior secured notes due 2008 at a redemption price of 112 of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes in connection with the offering we further amended our senior bank facilities to permit us to use the proceeds of this offering within 270 days of completion to purchase redeem or retire a portion of our senior subordinated notes due 2009 and our first lien senior secured notes and second lien senior secured notes 

  

the details of each of these financing events are outlined in the following sections also see note 7 “longterm debt” note 10 “redeemable preferred stock” and note 11 “common stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

september 2001 waiver under senior credit facilities and issuance of convertible preferred stock to texas pacific group 

  

at june 29 2001 we were not in compliance with minimum interest expense coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio covenants under our senior bank facilities on august 13 2001 we received a waiver in respect of this noncompliance at june 29 2001 and in respect of any future noncompliance with these covenants through december 31 2002 in connection with this waiver we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things reduce the minimum interest expense coverage requirement and increase the maximum leverage ratio requirement through december 31 2005 add minimum cash and ebitda requirements through december 31 2002 increase the required interest rate spreads applicable to outstanding borrowings referred to below as “supplemental interest” and change certain mandatory prepayment requirements 

  

as a condition to the waiver and amendment we were required to obtain 1000 million through an equity investment from an affiliate of texas pacific group our principal stockholder we satisfied this requirement on 

  

september 7 2001 when we issued 10000 shares of series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock to an affiliate of texas pacific group in exchange for 100 million 992 million net of issuance costs in this transaction we issued 10000 shares of mandatorily redeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock 

  

may 2002 issuance of second lien senior secured notes and amendment to senior bank facilities 

  

on may 6 2002 we issued 3000 million principal amount of second lien senior secured notes due 2008 the second lien senior secured notes were issued at a price of 96902 of par and will mature on may 15 2008 the second lien senior secured notes initially accrued interest at a rate of 12 per annum commencing february 6 2003 the second lien senior secured notes began accruing interest at a rate of 13 per annum this increased rate will remain in effect until maturity interest on the second lien senior secured notes is payable semiannually in cash the obligations under the second lien senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the domestic subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation other than semiconductor components industries llc which is a coissuer the second lien senior secured notes and the guarantees thereof are secured on a secondpriority basis by the assets that secure our senior bank facilities and they rank equal in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness and senior to our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness and effectively junior to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that have not guaranteed such second lien senior secured notes in connection with the offering of second lien senior secured notes we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things permit the issuance of the second lien senior secured notes make certain of the financial ratio maintenance requirements thereunder less restrictive and impose minimum ebitda and cash requirements see note 7 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report we used 2786 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of the second lien senior secured notes to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities 

  

because the remaining principal amount of loans outstanding under our senior bank facilities was reduced below 7500 million as a result of this refinancing the supplemental interest charges thereon described in note 7 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report were reduced from 30 to 10 in connection with this refinancing we wrote off 65 million of debt issuance costs

on march 3 2003 we issued 2000 million aggregate principal amount of first lien senior secured notes due 2010 the first lien senior secured notes were issued at a price of 95467 of par bear interest at a rate of 12 per annum payable semiannually in cash and will mature on march 15 2010 the obligations under the first lien senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the domestic subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation other than semiconductor components industries llc which is a coissuer the first lien senior secured notes and the guarantees thereof are secured on a firstpriority basis by the assets that secure our senior bank facilities and they rank equal in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness and senior to our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness and effectively junior to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that have not guaranteed such notes 

  

in connection with the offering of the first lien senior secured notes we further amended our senior bank facilities to among other things

see note 7 “longterm debt” note 10 “redeemable preferred stock” and note 11 “common stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

  

debt instruments guarantees and related covenants 

  

the following table presents the components of longterm debt as of december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

   

we have pledged substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and similar assets of each of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries but no more than 65 of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries held by them to secure our senior bank facilities first lien secured notes and second lien secured notes 

  

semiconductor components industries llc the primary domestic operating subsidiary of on semiconductor corporation is the borrower under our senior bank facilities on semiconductor corporation and our other domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee on a joint and several basis the obligations of the borrower under such facilities on semiconductor corporation and semiconductor components industries llc are coissuers of our first lien senior secured notes due 2010 our second lien senior secured notes due 2008 and senior subordinated notes due 2009 our other domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee on a joint and several basis the obligations of the issuers of such notes none of our nonus subsidiaries guarantees the senior bank facilities or the notes 

  

as of december 31 2003 we were in compliance with the various covenants and other requirements contained in the credit agreement relating to our senior bank facilities and the indentures relating to our first lien senior secured notes due 2010 second lien senior secured notes due 2008 and our senior subordinated notes due 2009 we believe that we will be able to comply with the various covenants and other requirements contained in such credit agreement and indentures through december 31 2004 

  

our debt agreements contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our senior bank facilities require that we maintain or achieve a minimum consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined and a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

cash management 

  

our ability to manage cash is limited as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements contractual obligations debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases we must invest in capital on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products 

  

accounting changes 

  

during the second quarter of 2003 we changed our method of accounting for net unrecognized actuarial gains or losses relating to our defined benefit pension obligations historically we amortized our net unrecognized actuarial gains or losses over the average remaining service lives of active plan participants to the extent that such net gains or losses exceeded the greater of 10 of the related projected benefit obligation or plan assets effective january 1 2003 we will no longer defer any actuarial gains or losses but will recognize such gains and losses during the fourth quarter of each year which is the period our annual pension plan actuarial valuations are prepared we believe that this change is to a preferable accounting method as actuarial gains or losses will be recognized currently in income rather than being deferred 

  

the impact of this change for periods prior to january 1 2003 was a charge of 215 million or 011 per share both before and after income taxes and has been reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations for 2003 the effect of the change in 2003 was to decrease the loss before cumulative effect of accounting change by 64 million or 003 per share both before and after income taxes and to increase the net loss by 160 million or 009 per share both before and after income taxes absent the accounting change the 215 million of net unrecognized actuarial losses at december 31 2002 would have been recognized as an operating expense in future periods 

  

effective january 1 2002 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the provisions of sfas no 141 require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized sfas no 141 also requires that upon adoption of sfas no 142 we reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill based on certain criteria sfas no 142 primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition the provisions of sfas no 142 prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and require that such assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill andor indefinitelived intangible assets may be impaired require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and remove the fortyyear limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives goodwill amortization expense totaled 106 million in 2001 

  

sfas no 142 requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with the related carrying amount including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary if the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value the second step test must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss if any the second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination with the carrying amount of such goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

  

our goodwill at january 1 2002 totaled 773 million and relates to the april 2000 acquisition of cherry semiconductor corporation “cherry” as a result of the adoption of sfas no 142 we discontinued amortization of the cherry goodwill at the beginning of 2002 

  

during the first quarter of 2002 we identified our various reporting units which correspond with our four product lines and allocated our assets and liabilities to such reporting units the goodwill relating to the cherry acquisition was specifically identified with and included in our power management and standard analog reporting unit during the second quarter of 2002 we completed the first step of its transitional goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of the power management and standard analog reporting unit as of january 1 2002 exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying amount by a substantial amount as a result an impairment of the cherry goodwill as of that date was not indicated and completion of the second step test was not required we updated our goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2002 and 2003 and determined that a related impairment did not exist 

  

as mentioned below in “critical accounting policies and estimates” effective january 1 2001 we changed our accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales to distributors recognition of revenue and related gross profit on sales to distributors is now deferred until the distributor resells the product we believe that this change better aligns reported results with focuses us on and allows investors to better understand end user demand for 

  

the products that we sell through distributors our new revenue recognition policy is commonly used in the semiconductor industry the cumulative effect of the accounting change for periods prior to january 1 2001 was a charge of 1552 million 1164 million or 067 per share net of income taxes the accounting change resulted in an increase in revenues of 1166 million and a decrease in our net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change of 531 million or 030 per share for the year ended december 31 2001 

  

also effective january 1 2001 we adopted sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended which establishes standards for the accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities our interest rate swaps in effect at january 1 2001 were designated as cash flow hedges were measured at fair value and recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet upon adoption of sfas no 133 we recorded a charge of 57 million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of january 1 2001 this charge consisted of a 22 million adjustment to record our interest rate swaps in the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values as well as the writeoff of an approximate 35 million pretax deferred charge included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2000 relating to the payment made in december 2000 for the early termination of an interest rate protection agreement relating to a portion of the amounts outstanding under our senior bank facilities 

  

in addition to hedging a portion of our interest rate exposure we use forward foreign currency contracts to reduce our overall exposure to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities with gains and losses offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying assets or liabilities the adoption of sfas no 133 did not impact our accounting and reporting for these derivative instruments 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america note 3 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contain a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

revenue we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers when title passes to the customer net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances 

  

effective january 1 2001 we changed our revenue recognition policy for distributor sales so that the related revenues are now deferred until the distributor resells the product to the end user this change eliminated the need to provide for estimated sales returns from distributors title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet we recognize the related revenue and margin when the distributor sells the products to the end user although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days 

  

sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products our actual returns and allowances do not fluctuate significantly from period to period and our returns and allowances provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 

  

inventories we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand projected end user demand is generally based on sales during the prior twelve months these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved impacting our cost of sales and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the vast majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2001 a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets additionally throughout 2002 and 2003 no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 

  

impairment of longlived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests in recent years most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in some instances these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value when material these gains are recorded in the restructuring asset impairment and other net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 

  

goodwill we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary to date our goodwill has not been considered to be impaired based on the results of this first step 

  

defined benefit plans we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees all of these assumptions are based upon management’s judgment considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact the future expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans 

  

convertible redeemable preferred stock we account for the difference between the carrying amount of our convertible redeemable preferred stock and the redemption value by increasing the carrying amount for periodic accretion so that the carrying amount equals the redemption value at the earliest available redemption date the periodic accretion amount changes as our stock price changes and as additional dividends accrue based on the average closing price of our common stock over the last 30 trading days preceding december 31 2003 of 619 the accretion charge in respect to the redemption feature for the fourth quarter of 2003 was 05 million for every one dollar increase in the average closing price used in the accretion calculation the accretion charge we would record in the first quarter of 2004 will increase by approximately 09 million 

  

contingencies we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on the available information we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and estimable 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 149 amends and clarifies the accounting guidance on derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities that fall within the scope of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 with certain exceptions and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 the adoption of sfas no 149 did not impact our financial condition or results of operations 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” sfas no 150 specifies that freestanding financial instruments within its scope constitute obligations of the issuer that must be classified as liabilities and carried at liquidation value such freestanding financial instruments include mandatorily redeemable financial instruments obligations to repurchase the issuer’s equity shares by transferring assets and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares equity securities of consolidated entities that meet the definition of a mandatorily redeemable security by virtue of having a finite life “mandatorily redeemable minority interests” are included in the scope of sfas no 150 the minority interest associated with our investment in leshan is a mandatorily redeemable minority interest within the scope of sfas no 150 by virtue of leshan’s finite life of 50 years as specified in its organizational documents in november 2003 the fasb issued staff position no 1503 which deferred the measurement and classification provisions of sfas no 150 relating to leshan pending further action by the fasb we are required to disclose the liquidation value of the leshan minority interest which we believe approximates the related carrying value of 260 million at december 31 2003 our adoption of the other provisions of sfas no 150 in 2003 did not impact our financial condition or results of operations 

  

in december 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 132 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits revised 2003” “sfas no 132” sfas no 132 requires additional disclosures to those in the original sfas no 132 with respect to the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans sfas no 132 which also requires new disclosures for interim periods beginning after december 15 2003 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 except for certain disclosures associated with foreign plans which are required for years ended after june 15 2004 we adopted this statement for the year ended december 31 2003 and included the required disclosures in note 13 “employee benefit plans” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

trends risks and uncertainties related to our business 

  

we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and operating losses in the future 

  

our historical financial results have been and our future financial results are anticipated to be subject to substantial fluctuations our revenues for 2003 were 10691 million compared to 10937 million for 2002 and 12232 million in 2001 this decline was due primarily to declines in the average selling prices for our products we incurred net losses of 1667 million 1419 million and 8314 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the most recent downturn in our business has been most pronounced with respect to our high frequency clock and data management products revenues from high frequency clock and data management products represented  805 million 720 million and 1185 million or 75 66 and 98 of the total revenues in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

reduced enduser demand continued price declines excess inventory underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business in the near term and we may experience additional declines in revenue and operating losses in the future in order to return to profitability we must successfully implement our business plan including our cost reduction initiatives however we also currently face an environment of uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address we cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that we will be able to sustain our profitability if achieved 

  

we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns 

  

the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience such downturns in the future the most recent downturn which began in the fourth quarter of 2000 was severe and prolonged and it is uncertain whether recent improvements in semiconductor industry performance will continue or whether such improvements will benefit us to the same extent as they benefit other industry participants future downturns in the semiconductor industry may also be severe and prolonged future downturns in the semiconductor industry or any failure of the industry to fully recover from its recent downturn could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

during the 1990s and continuing into 2000 the semiconductor industry enjoyed unprecedented growth benefiting from the rapid expansion of the internet and other computing and communications technologies during 2001 we — like many of our customers and competitors — were adversely affected by a general economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the enduser products that incorporate our integrated circuits and standard semiconductors the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 also further depressed economic activity and demand for enduser products the impact of slowing endcustomer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of equipment and component inventories among our original equipment manufacturer subcontractor and distributor customers resulting in increasing pricing pressure we expect that factors including but not limited to economic uncertainty and downturns relating to the threat or actual occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks reduced demand for enduser products underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and changes in our revenue mix could adversely impact our operating results in the near term 

  

our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization 

  

semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins the decline in product orders and shipments in 2001 resulted in reduced capacity utilization of our facilities as we have attempted to match production with anticipated customer demand as a percentage of revenues gross margin was 282 for 2003 compared to 273 for 2002 and 184 in 2001 although our gross margin as a percent of revenues improved between 2001 and 2002 gross margin declined sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2002 the first quarter of 2003 and the third quarter of 2003 in each case as a result of pricing pressure increased competition and other factors may lead to further price erosion lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

  

the failure to implement as well as the completion and impact of our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 

  

between 2000 and the end of 2003 we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in response to the significant downturn in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead however we cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will in and of themselves return us to profitability 

  

we recorded restructuring charges of 1504 million in 2001 277 million in 2002 and 612 million in 2003 to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments the impact of these restructuring actions on our ability to 

  

compete effectively is subject to risks and uncertainties because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 

  

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 

  

our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 expand further our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 reduce further the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 continue to manage our existing portfolio of products aggressively 7 rationalize our manufacturing operations 8 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 9 reduce selling and administrative expenses 10 reduce capital expenditures 11 actively manage working capital 12 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 13 focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 

  

our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other things to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

  

we may require additional capital in the future and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 

  

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with the cash that we expect to generate from our operations and sales of assets in the ordinary course of business will be sufficient to meet our planned capital needs for the next twelve months however it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to fund our future activities or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses products or technologies as of march 1 2004 we have 123 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility subject to the restrictions contained in our senior bank facilities and the indentures governing our first lien senior secured notes due 2010 our second lien senior secured notes due 2008 and our senior subordinated notes due 2009 we may be able to raise these funds by selling securities to the public or selected investors or by borrowing money we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available we may be required to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development make selective dispositions of our assets or obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets or otherwise impair our ability to remain competitive 

  

we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 

  

the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive the primary emphasis of our new product development is in the power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management solutions with over 70 of our overall research and development investment targeted in these areas 

  

uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business 

  

our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant penalty we routinely purchase inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 

  

during 2001 the markets in which our customers operate were characterized by a dramatic decline in enduser demand and continued high levels of channel inventories which reduced visibility of future demand for our products and in some cases led to delays or defaults in payments for our products in 2002 and the first half of 2003 short customer lead times prevailed given the overcapacity in the industry these and other factors adversely affected our revenues during this period 

  

an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 

  

rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 

  

the semiconductor industry particularly the market for semiconductor components is highly competitive as a result of the recent economic downturn competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production 

  

overcapacity and high inventory levels although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness 

  

many of our competitors may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories and presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition 

  

because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 

  

we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends 

  

unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected 

  

manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 

  

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other things capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 

  

we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing technology and equipment to remain competitive 

  

in view of industry conditions in recent years we reduced our capital expenditures from 1490 million in 2001 to 405 million in 2002 in 2003 however our capital expenditures totaled 598 million we may be required to increase our future capital expenditures to meet increased demand 

  

semiconductor manufacturing has historically required and in the future is likely to continue to require a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes 

  

are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices we maintain certain of our own manufacturing assembly and test facilities which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 

  

we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment in addition our principal credit agreement limits the amount of our capital expenditures 

  

if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

  

product sales to our ten largest customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 54 52 and 46 of our total revenues in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 

  

the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity 

  

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including silicon wafers copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

  

in addition for some of our products such as our new silicon germanium sige technology we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 

  

we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods these contract manufacturers including amkor psi ait ase kec hynix liteon chartered and phenitec accounted for approximately 26 30 and 31 of our cost of sales in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations could be adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 

  

in the case of motorola we agreed to continue providing manufacturing services to each other including motorola’s manufacturing of our emittercoupled logic products for limited periods of time following our 1999 

  

recapitalization under our agreements with motorola the prices of these services are fixed at levels that are intended to approximate each party’s cost of providing the services we fulfilled our minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from motorola in 2002 we could be adversely affected if we are unable to relocate these manufacturing operations to our own facilities or to other thirdparty manufacturers on costeffective terms or make other satisfactory arrangements prior to the time when these agreements expire 

  

acquisitions and strategic alliances may harm our operating results or cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities or dilute our stockholders 

  

we may in the future acquire and form strategic alliances relating to other businesses products and technologies successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts the difficulties of integration and alignment may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations the complexity of the technologies being integrated and aligned and the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures the integration and alignment of operations following an acquisition or alliance requires the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the daytoday business and may disrupt key research and development marketing or sales efforts in addition we may issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results without strategic acquisitions and alliances we may have difficulty meeting future customer product and service requirements 

  

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 

  

approximately 37 44 and 19 of our total revenues in 2002 and 30 52 and 18 of our total revenues in 2003 were derived from the americas the asiapacific region and europe including the middle east respectively we maintain significant operations in seremban malaysia carmona the philippines aizu japan leshan china roznov the czech republic and piestany the slovak republic in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asiapacific region 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange while our sales are 

  

primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 

  

if we fail to attract and retain highlyskilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 

  

our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive for example analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel as employee incentives we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting at times our stock price has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 

  

also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty patents or other intellectual property rights motorola has agreed to indemnify us for a limited period of time with respect to some claims that our activities infringe on the intellectual property rights of others if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or 

  

technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 

  

we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 

  

we are party to securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

  

in july 2001 three stockholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us certain of our former officers current and former directors and various investment banking firms who acted as underwriters in connection with our initial public offering in may 2000 in april 2002 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint that supercedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint generally alleges that our offering documents failed to disclose certain underwriting fees and commissions and underwriter tieins and other arrangements with certain customers of the underwriters that impacted the price of our common stock in the aftermarket the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages on july 15 2002 together with other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the class action lawsuit on february 19 2003 as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws the court dismissed these claims with prejudice as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws the court denied the motion to dismiss these claims in addition the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the current and former directors and officers who were named as individual defendants in the litigation in june 2003 upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation formal settlement documents for submission to the court are currently being drafted if this proposed settlement is ultimately finalized and then submitted to and approved by the court it would result in a dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elect to participate in the proposed settlement together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants 

  

we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this securities litigation any conclusion of this litigation in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition the cost to us of defending the litigation even if resolved in our favor could be substantial such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of this litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future 

  

environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other things regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our 1999 recapitalization we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 

  

based on information currently available to us we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict 

  

   

   

   

   

terrorist attacks such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington dc on september 11 2001 or threats or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades the markets in which we operate and our profitability 

  

on september 11 2001 the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope the threat or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades the market in which we operate and our profitability the terrorist attacks have caused instability in the global financial markets and future or threatened terrorist attacks or occurrences of international armed conflict could result in greater economic instability 

  

warranty claims product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both in addition if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in their recall as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established 

  

reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall would have adverse effects that could be material on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness 

  

our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 

  

we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations as of december 31 2003 we had total longterm indebtedness of 13029 million including current maturities but excluding unused commitments and interest expense of 1511 million for the year ended december 31 2003 also we may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments 

  

the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to you including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may incur more debt which could exacerbate the risks described above 

  

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness but do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ current debt levels the related risks that we and they now face could intensify some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness 

  

the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 

  

our debt agreements contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our senior bank facilities require that we maintain or achieve a minimum consolidated ebitda and a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

  

our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness including as a result of events beyond our control could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 

  

if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments including the notes 

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 

  

our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness as of march 1 2004 we have 123 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility as of january 9 2003 we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than 25 million we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

  

trends risks and uncertainties related to our common stock 

  

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 

  

given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

holders of our common stock may experience dilution and the price of our common stock may decline as a result of the issuance of stock in the future 

  

in september 2001 we sold 10000 shares of our series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock to tpg on holdings llc an affiliate of the texas pacific group each share of preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder into approximately 3546 shares of our common stock as of the issue date excluding shares into which the preferred stock is convertible due to accumulated and unpaid dividends and subject to customary antidilution adjustments under the antidilution provisions the conversion price is subject to downward adjustment in the event we issue common stock or derivative securities entitling the holder to subscribe for or acquire common stock at a price below the thencurrent conversion price or market price holders of preferred stock are entitled to cumulative dividends payable quarterly in cash at a rate of 8 per annum or if greater during the relevant quarterly period in an amount equal to the value of the dividends that would be paid on our common stock then issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock subject to applicable restrictions imposed by our principal credit facility in the event dividends are not paid the dividends will accumulate on a compounded basis and the number of shares of common stock into which the preferred stock is convertible will increase proportionately 

  

there is a possibility that the preferred stock will be converted at a price per share that is less than the then current market price of our common stock if this were to occur it may cause substantial dilution to our existing common stockholders additionally we registered the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 

  

preferred stock under the securities act for public resale therefore in the event that the preferred stock is converted a substantial number of shares of our common stock may be sold into the market which could decrease the trading price of our common stock and encourage short sales by the selling shareholder or others short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock in addition to the preferred stock we may issue more stock in the future which may cause dilution and a decline in the price of our common stock 

  

our stock price may be volatile which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 

  

the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

  

the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors some of which are beyond our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

as of march 1 2004 the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has ranged from a high of 2775 on may 1 2000 to a low of 089 on october 4 2002 

  

tpg as our principal stockholder controls our company which will limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters submitted for a vote of the stockholders 

  

affiliates of texas pacific group own 111858369 shares of our common stock and 10000 shares of series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock as of march 1 2004 these shares represented over 51 of the total voting power of our capital stock as a result texas pacific group through its affiliates will be able to 

  

   

   

   

in addition our certificate of incorporation provides that the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which relate to business combinations with interested stockholders do not apply to us 

  

provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company which could decrease the value of our stock 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

  

at december 31 2003 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 13029 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 9148 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 3881 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt however from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap to reduce this exposure as of december 31 2003 we had an interest rate swap covering 100 million of our variable interest rate debt a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would not materially change our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months 

  

a majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however as a multinational business we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments this strategy reduces but does not eliminate the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements for example changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

none 

  




 item 9a disclosure controls and procedures 

  

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to exchange act rule 13a15b based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered in this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

communications consumer electronics automotive and industrial electronics and computing and networking applications for our products in these markets include portable electronics computers game stations servers automotive and industrial automation control systems routers switches storagearea networks and automated test equipment   we have four main product lines power management and standard analog devices metal oxide semiconductor mos power devices high frequency clock and data management devices and standard components our extensive portfolio of devices enables us to offer advanced integrated circuits and “building block” components that deliver system level functionality and design solutions our product portfolio currently comprises approximately 15000 products and we shipped approximately 211 billion units in 2002 we specialize in micro packages which offer increased performance characteristics while reducing the critical board space inside today’s ever shrinking electronic devices we believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products provides our customers with single source purchasing on a costeffective and timely basis   we have approximately 200 direct customers worldwide and we also service approximately 300 significant original equipment manufacturers indirectly through our distributor and electronic manufacturing service provider customers our direct and indirect customers include 1 leading original equipment manufacturers in a broad variety of industries such as alcatel daimlerchrysler delphi delta electronics intel motorola nokia siemens sony and visteon 2 electronic manufacturing service providers such as flextronics sanminasci and solectron and 3 global distributors such as arrow avnet and future electronics   we have design operations in arizona rhode island china hong kong the czech republic and france and we operate manufacturing facilities independently and through joint ventures in arizona rhode island china the czech republic japan malaysia the philippines and slovakia   immediately prior to our august 4 1999 recapitalization we were a whollyowned subsidiary of motorola inc we held and continue to hold through direct and indirect subsidiaries and a joint venture substantially all of the assets and operations of the semiconductor components group of motorola’s semiconductor products sector as a result of the recapitalization an affiliate of texas pacific group owned approximately 91 and motorola owned approximately 9 of our outstanding common stock in addition as part of the recapitalization texas pacific group received 1500 shares and motorola received 590 shares of the company’s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation value of 2090 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends motorola also received a 91 million junior subordinated note due 2011 issued by semiconductor components industries llc our primary domestic operating subsidiary cash payments to motorola in connection with the recapitalization were financed through equity investments by affiliates of texas pacific group totaling 3375 million borrowings totaling 7405 million under our 8750 million senior bank facilities and the issuance of 4000 million of 12 senior subordinated notes due august 2009 because texas pacific group’s affiliate did not acquire substantially all of our common stock the recapitalization did not impact the basis of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes at the time of the recapitalization motorola agreed to provide us with transition and manufacturing services in order to facilitate our transition to a standalone company independent of motorola 1   on april 3 2000 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of cherry semiconductor corporation for 2532 million in cash including acquisition related costs which we financed with cash on hand and borrowings of 2200 million under our senior bank facilities cherry semiconductor corporation which we have renamed semiconductor components industries of rhode island inc designs and manufactures analog and mixed signal integrated circuits for the power management and automotive markets see note 6 “acquisition” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in each case included elsewhere in this report   on may 3 2000 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock selling 345 million shares with an issue price of 16 per share net proceeds from the initial public offering after deducting issuance costs were approximately 5148 million the net proceeds were used to redeem all outstanding preferred stock including accrued dividends redeem a portion of the senior subordinated notes and prepay a portion of the loans outstanding under the senior bank facilities see note 12 “common stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report   on september 7 2001 we obtained 1000 million 992 million net of issuance costs through an equity investment by an affiliate of texas pacific group our principal shareholder in this transaction we issued 10000 shares of mandatorily redeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock this investment was required because we were not in compliance with certain minimum interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants under our senior bank facilities see note 9 “longterm debt” and note 11 “redeemable preferred stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in each case included elsewhere in this report   on may 6 2002 we issued 3000 million principal amount of second lien senior secured notes due 2008 the second lien senior secured notes were issued at a price of 96902 of par and will mature on may 15 2008 the second lien senior secured notes initially accrued interest at a rate of 12 per annum commencing february 6 2003 the second lien senior secured notes began accruing interest at a rate of 13 per annum this increased rate will remain in effect unless on or prior to august 6 2003 we have issued common stock or certain convertible preferred stock to financial sponsors generating at least 1000 million in gross cash proceeds to prepay indebtedness under our senior bank facilities or under any other senior credit facility secured by a firstpriority lien and have permanently reduced the related loan commitments equal to the amount prepaid interest on the second lien senior secured notes is payable semi annually in cash the obligations under the second lien senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the domestic subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation other than semiconductor components industries llc which is a coissuer the second lien senior secured notes and the guarantees thereof are secured on a secondpriority basis by the assets that secure our senior bank facilities and they rank equal in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness and senior to our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness and effectively junior to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that have not guaranteed such second lien senior secured notes in connection with the offering of second lien senior secured notes we amended our senior bank facilities to among other things permit the issuance of the second lien senior secured notes make certain of the financial ratio maintenance requirements thereunder less restrictive and impose minimum ebitda and cash requirements see note 9 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in each case included elsewhere in this report we used 2786 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of the second lien senior secured notes to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities because the remaining principal amount of loans outstanding under our senior bank facilities was reduced below 7500 million as a result of this refinancing the supplemental interest charges thereon described in note 9 “longterm debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report were reduced from 30 to 10 in connection with this refinancing we wrote off 65 million of debt issuance costs 2   on march 3 2003 we issued 2000 million principal amount of first lien senior secured notes due 2010 the first lien senior secured notes were issued at a price of 95467 of par value bear interest at a rate of 12 per annum payable semiannually in cash and will mature on march 15 2010 the obligations under the first lien senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the domestic subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation other than semiconductor components industries llc which is a coissuer the first lien senior secured notes and the guarantees thereof are secured on a firstpriority basis by the assets that secure our senior bank facilities and they rank equal in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness and senior to our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness and effectively junior to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that have not guaranteed such notes in connection with the offering of the first lien senior secured notes we further amended our senior bank facilities to among other things permit the issuance of the first lien senior secured notes remove certain of the financial ratio maintenance requirements thereunder make the minimum ebitda requirement thereunder less restrictive and make the maximum capital expenditure covenant more restrictive we used 1809 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of the first lien senior secured notes to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities including 250 million of which proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and permanently reduce the commitments thereunder by such amount in connection with this refinancing we wroteoff 35 million of debt issuance costs   the amendment to our senior bank facilities described in the paragraph above also resulted in the conversion of 625 million of the outstanding loans under our revolving credit facility into a new tranche of term loans that matures on the date our revolving credit facility matures as of march 7 2003 86 million of our 625 million revolving credit facility was available reflecting outstanding loans of 375 million and outstanding letters of credit of 164 million as of january 9 2003 we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than 25 million   as a response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry in the fourth quarter of 2000 and in the fourth quarter of 2002 we initiated worldwide profitability enhancement programs to better align our cost structure with our revenues the principal elements of these programs are 1 implementing a manufacturing rationalization plan that involved among other things plant closures and the efficient reallocation of capacity among other facilities the relocation or outsourcing of related operations to take advantage of lower cost labor markets and the rationalization of our product portfolio 2 reducing nonmanufacturing personnel and implementing other cost controls in connection with which we have relocated certain of our order entry finance quality assurance and information technology functions to lower cost locations and simplified our overall corporate structure and our regional infrastructure and 3 improving our liquidity by reducing capital expenditures managing our working capital actively and reducing our cost structure through various measures including reducing some employee compensation and spending on information technology and outside consultants certain elements of these programs that we commenced in june 2001 were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 and resulted in 3650 million of annualized cost savings based on a comparison of our cost structure during the first quarter of 2001 to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002 in addition as a result of additional cost cutting commenced in the fourth quarter of 2002 which is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2003 we expect to achieve an estimated 800 million of cost savings in 2003 and an estimated 1250 million of cost savings in each year thereafter in both cases as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002 as a result of these efforts we incurred restructuring and other charges of 277 million in 2002 and 1504 million in 2001 see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included elsewhere in this report   effective january 1 2001 we changed our accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales to distributors recognition of revenue and related gross profit on sales to distributors is now deferred until the distributor resells the product we believe that this change better aligns reported results with focuses us on and allows investors to better understand end user demand for the products that we sell through distributors this revenue recognition policy is commonly used in the semiconductor industry see note 4 “accounting changes” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in each case included elsewhere in this report 3 products and technology   the following table provides information regarding our primary product lines     power

customers   we have been doing business with 19 of our 20 largest customers for more than five years and have entered into purchase agreements with 15 of such customers these agreements normally are renewable every twelve months and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment delivery warranty and supply these agreements do not require minimum purchase commitments our customers include original equipment manufacturers electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors our products are ultimately purchased by end users for use in a variety of markets including networking and computing wireless communications consumer electronics automotive electronics and industrial electronics sales to arrow avnet and motorola accounted for approximately 10 10 and 8 respectively of our total revenue during 2002 compared to 7 8 and 8 respectively during 2001 and 12 11 and 10 respectively for 2000   we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications subject to certain exceptions our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of 1 three years from the date of shipment or 2 the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge warranty expense to date has been minimal generally our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty for additional information regarding agreements with our customers see “backlog” below   the following table sets forth our principal enduser markets the estimated percentage based in part on information provided by our distributors and electronic manufacturing service providers of our total revenues 5 generated from each enduser market during 2002 sample applications for our products and representative original equipment manufacturer customers and end users 

end markets for our products    original equipment manufacturers direct sales to original equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately 48 of our total revenues in 2002 approximately 47 in 2001 and approximately 44 in 2000 these customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as alcatel hewlettpackard 6 intel motorola nokia philips siemens and sony and in the automotive industry such as daimlerchrysler delphi trw and visteon we focus on three types of original equipment manufacturers multinationals selected regional accounts and target market customers large multinationals and selected regional accounts which are significant in specific markets are our core original equipment manufacturer customers the target market customers in the communications power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are original equipment manufacturers that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development generally our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 

  distributors sales to distributors accounted for approximately 41 of our total revenues in 2002 approximately 43 in 2001 and approximately 44 in 2000 our distributors which include arrow avnet all american eliteron and future resell to midsized and smaller original equipment manufacturers and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slowmoving products under certain agreements distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book or that is more than four years older than the manufacturing code date in addition agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns however since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product sales returns have minimal impact on our profits   electronic manufacturing service providers direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 11 of our total revenues in 2002 approximately 10 in 2001 and approximately 12 in 2000 our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are flextronics sanminasci and solectron these customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers originally these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards but they now typically provide design supply management and manufacturing solutions as well many original equipment manufacturers now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies we are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace 

manufacturing operations   we operate our manufacturing facilities either directly or through a joint venture four of these are frontend wafer facilities located in japan slovakia and the united states two are backend assembly and test facilities located in china and the philippines and two are integrated frontend and backend facilities located in malaysia and the czech republic in addition to these manufacturing and assembly operations our terosil facility in roznov czech republic manufactures raw wafers that are used by a number of our facilities during 2001 we made the decision to shutdown our integrated facility in guadalajara mexico and transfer the frontend and backend manufacturing to other owned and contracted locations accordingly the guadalajara mexico facility ceased operations in the second quarter of 2002 also during 2001 the backend only manufacturing operation that was part of the integrated manufacturing operation at site2 in seremban malaysia was shutdown and the related production transferred to our joint venture in leshan china frontend manufacturing remains unchanged at site2 and the existing backend manufacturing remains unchanged at site1 also in seremban malaysia we also use thirdparty contract manufacturers our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts in some cases longerterm commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship   the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture as well as the products produced at these facilities the sizes of the locations represent the approximate gross square feet of each site’s building and include among other things manufacturing laboratory warehousing office utility support and unused areas 7    we entered into an agreement with motorola to continue to provide manufacturing services to each other for limited periods of time following our recapitalization we negotiated fixed prices with motorola for the services covered by these agreements to approximate each party’s cost of providing the services for 2002 2001 and 2000 motorola purchased 14 million 82 million and 617 million respectively of manufacturing services from us with no minimum purchase commitments going forward at this time these purchases are classified as revenues in our financial statements we purchased 138 million 861 million and 1623 million of manufacturing services from motorola in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively fulfilling our minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from motorola during such periods pursuant to a new agreement with motorola we have committed to purchase approximately 10 million of manufacturing services from motorola in 2003   in the czech republic we operate two majorityowned subsidiaries tesla and terosil these subsidiaries are publicly traded czech companies in which we directly own 816 and 756 equity interests as of december 31 2002 respectively tesla operates an integrated frontend manufacturing and backend assembly facility while terosil manufactures raw wafers that are used by a number of our facilities we purchased 95 88 and 77 of the total output of terosil in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively and purchased the entire output of tesla for all three years in 2001 we entered into new sevenyear agreements with terosil and tesla where we provide both subsidiaries with forecasted needs on a quarterly basis with minimum commitments limited to our forecasted demand within thirty days from the start of production   in leshan china we operate a joint venture leshanphoenix semiconductor company ltd “leshan” which operates a backend manufacturing facility we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests of the leshan joint venture the other shareholder is a chinese state owned enterprise named leshan radio company ltd due to certain rights held by this minority shareholder we do not exercise control over this entity normally commensurate with majority ownership and therefore account for it using the equity method pursuant to the joint venture agreement requests for production capacity are made to the board of 8 directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture these requests represent a purchase commitment by the respective shareholders of the leshan joint venture provided however that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of the commitment we committed to purchase 85 81 and 86 of leshan’s production capacity in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively and are currently committed to purchase 82 of leshan’s expected production capacity in 2003 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively we purchased 76 43 and 91 of leshan’s production because we purchased less than our committed amounts in 2002 and 2001 we incurred 15 million and 64 million in underutilization charges respectively 

  we provide forecasted needs to leshan on a periodic basis an approximate sixmonth cycle which are used to establish pricing over the forecasted period and as described above we are responsible for underutilized capacity cost due to variations from our forecasted needs as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan we supply them with die used in the production process sales of die to leshan are not recorded as revenue due to the related party nature of the transactions as of december 31 2002 we had accounts receivable and accounts payable of 96 million and 102 million respectively related to manufacturing activity with leshan   the leshan joint venture is one of our lowest cost providers and we anticipate any future expansion plans will include this facility including the previously announced start of construction in august 2002 of a 6inch wafer fabrication facility at leshan in june 2002 we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to 231 million for semiconductor operations which is in addition to the 278 million originally approved at december 31 2002 our total investment in and advances to this joint venture was 993 million including loans of 633 million   our manufacturing processes use many raw materials including silicon wafers copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases we have no material agreements with any of our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry   we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods these contract manufacturers including asat amkor psi ait ase hynix liteon chartered and phenitec accounted for approximately 30 31 and 40 of our cost of sales in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively these reductions in the use of thirdparty contractors were part of our efforts to improve internal capacity utilization under our manufacturing rationalization plan 

sales marketing and distribution   as of december 31 2002 our global sales and marketing organization consists of approximately 410 professionals operating out of approximately 50 offices and serving customers in 39 countries we support our customers through logistics organizations and justintime warehouses global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service we offer efficient costeffective internetbased applications support from our laboratories in the czech republic china and the united states through online connectivity applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions pursuant to our restructuring programs we have downsized our sales force by approximately 230 employees closed approximately 20 of our sales offices and in some regions converted sales personnel to sales representatives in addition we have centralized and relocated our order entry functions to low cost locations as a result of additional cost cutting measures announced in the fourth quarter of 2002 we expect further downsizing see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 5 “restructuring and other charges” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in each case as included elsewhere in this report   motorola agreed to provide us with worldwide shipping and freight services for a period of up to three years following our 1999 recapitalization this resulted in better prices than we could obtain from third parties 9 cost increases resulting from the termination of the shipping and freight service agreement in july 2002 were estimated to be approximately 11 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 

patents trademarks copyrights and other intellectual property rights   we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor® and our on logo we own rights to a number of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property directly related to and important to our business in connection with our recapitalization motorola assigned licensed or sublicensed as the case may be to us certain intellectual property to support and continue the operation of our business as of february 10 2003 we had approximately 450 us and foreign patents and approximately 160 patent applications pending worldwide our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2003 to 2021 none of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business additionally we hold more than 215 us and foreign trademarks and applications our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate   under an intellectual property agreement that we entered into with motorola as part of our recapitalization motorola assigned approximately 295 us patents and patent applications approximately 292 foreign patents and patent applications rights to over 50 trademarks not including the motorola name previously used in connection with our products rights in knowhow relating to at least 39 semiconductor fabrication processes and rights in specified copyrightable materials in addition motorola licensed on a nonexclusive royaltyfree basis other patent trademark copyright and knowhow rights used in connection with our then existing products and products contemplated in our longrange plans we have perpetual royaltyfree worldwide rights under motorola’s patent portfolio and other intellectual property existing as of the date of our recapitalization or created in the five years thereafter the fiveyear period existing only with respect to patents as necessary to manufacture market and sell our then existing and long range plan product lines additionally motorola provided us with a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from certain infringement claims by third parties who had granted motorola licenses as of the date of our recapitalization which will assist us in developing our own patent position and licensing program we believe that we have the right to use all motorolaowned technology used in connection with the products we currently offer seasonality   historically our revenues have been affected by the seasonal trends of the semiconductor and related industries as a result of these trends we typically experienced sales increases in the first two quarters of the year and relatively flat sales levels in the third and fourth quarters however over the past three years various events have disrupted this pattern in the fourth quarter of 2000 and throughout 2001 revenues declined due to slowing demand in the semiconductor market and the general economic decline in 2002 revenues were relatively flat and at this time it is unclear when the semiconductor industry is going to return to its seasonal trends backlog   our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders that are booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery generally prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and our estimates of orders based on customer forecasts in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13week period following such date backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times during 2002 our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 74 and 87 of actual revenues during such quarter our backlog has increased from 199 million as of december 31 2001 to 211 million as of december 31 2002   in the semiconductor industry backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or as a matter of industry practice are often not enforced therefore a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable for these reasons the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 10   we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that are typically annual fixedprice agreements subject in some cases to quarterly negotiations these contracts allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with justintime principles while shortening the cycle times required to produce ordered product however these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 

competition   the semiconductor industry particularly the market for generalpurpose semiconductor products like ours is highly competitive although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products see “risk factors — competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs” elsewhere in this report   we compete with respect to power management and standard analog products standard components mos power devices and high frequency clock and data management products in the following manner

research and development   companysponsored research and development costs in 2002 2001 and 2000 were 679 million 63 of total revenues 809 million 67 of total revenues and 692 million 33 of total revenues respectively the increase between 2000 and 2001 resulted primarily from increased spending on new product development the primary emphasis of our new product development efforts is on power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management solutions the highest margin product lines within our portfolio with 80 of our overall research and development investments currently targeted in these areas since our ipo in may 2000 we have introduced over 850 new products and the portion of our revenue attributable to new products has increased over the last three years our target for research and development expenditures is 6 of revenues in 2003 

government regulation   our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination   our manufacturing facility in phoenix arizona is located on property that is a “superfund” site a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to cleanup activities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of onsite solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and offsite contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona as part of our recapitalization motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter   manufacturing facilities in slovakia and those of our majorityowned subsidiaries in the czech republic have ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that these facilities were operated by governmentowned entities in each case these remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located onsite and offsite with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded at each of the respective locations the governments of the czech republic and slovakia have agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries subject to specified limitations for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination based upon the information available we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material   our manufacturing facility in east greenwich rhode island has adjoining property that has localized soil contamination in connection with the purchase of the facility we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property based on the information available we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 12   we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and liability for currently known environmental conditions to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects it is possible however that future developments including changes in laws and regulations government policies customer specification personnel and physical property conditions including currently undiscovered contamination could lead to material costs 

employees   as of december 31 2002 we employed approximately 9570 worldwide consisting of approximately 7820 people employed directly and approximately 1750 people employed through our joint venture in leshan china most of whom are engaged in manufacturing services we do not currently have any collective bargaining arrangements with our employees except for those arrangements such as works councils that are obligatory for all employees or all employers in a particular industry under applicable foreign law of the total number of our employees including our joint venture in leshan china as of december 31 2002 approximately 8230 were engaged in manufacturing and information services approximately 410 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization and in customer service approximately 460 were engaged in administration and approximately 470 were engaged in research and development

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business based on information currently available management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters including the matters described in the next paragraphs will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows   during the period july 5 2001 through july 27 2001 we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our current and former officers current directors and the underwriters for our initial public offering the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york as abrams v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv6114 breuer v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv6287 and cohen v on semiconductor corp et al  ca no 01cv6942 on april 19 2002 the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint alleges among other things that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately 300 other publicly traded companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city which along with the cases against us have all been transferred to a single federal district judge for purposes of coordinated case management we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended and intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously the litigation process is inherently uncertain however and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us   accordingly on july 15 2002 together with the other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them in addition the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual current and former officers and directors who were named as defendants in our litigation and they are no longer parties to the lawsuit on february 19 2003 the court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants in that ruling the court granted in part and denied in part those motions as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws the court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to replead these claims as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded the court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well the court also denied the underwriter defendants’ motion to dismiss in all respects while we can make no promises or guarantees as to the outcome of these proceedings we believe 14 that the final result of these actions will have no material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this form 10k management’s discussion and analysis contain statements that are forwardlooking these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk uncertainties and other factors actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed in “trends risks and uncertainties” in this form 10k recent developments   the following section highlights significant recent developments in our marketplace our financial performance and our liquidity and capital structure however this section presents summary information only for further information regarding the events summarized herein you should read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in its entirety   semiconductor market performance   the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market for the last three years   17    worldwide semiconductor market sales were 1407 billion in 2002 including sales in our total addressable market of approximately 217 billion in 2002 industry sales and sales in our total addressable market increased 12 and 38 respectively as compared to 2001 the industry is cyclical and from 2000 to 2001 industry sales and sales in our total addressable market declined 320 from 2044 billion to 1390 billion and 296 from 297 billion to 209 billion respectively the foregoing information is based on information published by wsts the year 2001 was the worst single year downturn in industry history and was driven both by reduced volumes and lower average selling prices resulting from an inventory overbuild as well as excess semiconductor manufacturing capacity this is in contrast to 2000 when industry sales and sales in our total addressable market grew 37 and 31 respectively although semiconductor demand began to improve in 2002 it is uncertain when any meaningful recovery will occur current market conditions are characterized by excess capacity short lead times and significant pricing pressures particularly in a number of product lines in which we participate   on financial performance   revenues   the following table sets forth our total revenues for 2000 through 2002     our total revenues declined 380 in 2001 from 2000 while total sales in our total addressable market declined 296 during the same period during that period revenues from our high frequency clock and data management business declined 1774 million or 600 and foundry services provided to motorola decreased 535 million our total revenues declined 107 in 2002 from 2001 while total sales in our total addressable market increased by 38 during the same period during this period revenues from our high frequency clock and data management business declined further foundry services provided to motorola were reduced by 68 million production of certain products was discontinued and certain low margin opportunities were not pursued 18   profitability enhancement programs   in order to better align our cost structure with our revenues we initiated profitability enhancement programs in the fourth quarter of 2000 and in the fourth quarter of 2002 the principal elements of these programs are a manufacturing rationalization plan a reduction of nonmanufacturing personnel and other cost controls   the elements of the 2000 plan that we commenced in june 2001 were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 and resulted in 365 million of annualized cost savings based on a comparison of our cost structure during the first quarter of 2001 to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002 we expect the 2002 plan to be completed by the end of 2003 and to result in an estimated 80 million of cost savings in 2003 and an estimated 125 million of annual cost savings thereafter in both cases as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002 savings from these plans include reduced employee costs resulting from staff reductions reduced depreciation expense resulting from asset impairments and other cost savings resulting from the transfer of certain manufacturing and administrative functions to lower cost regions renegotiation of service and supply contracts and other actions taken to improve our manufacturing efficiency   the following table summarizes the annual cost savings from the 2000 plan by type and by the applicable caption contained in our consolidated statement of operations in millions    the following table summarizes the estimated annual cost savings from the 2002 plan that we expect annually following 2003 by type of cost and by the applicable caption contained in our consolidated statement of operations in millions    manufacturing rationalization plan to create operating leverage and efficiencies and to accelerate our ongoing transformation into a leading low cost producer we have implemented and continue to implement manufacturing cost saving initiatives such as the closure of some of our plants the relocation or outsourcing of operations to take advantage of lower cost labor markets the consolidation of other operations the transfer of some of our external supply to internal operations and the rationalization of our product portfolio this plan included among other actions phasing out manufacturing operations at our guadalajara mexico facility and transferring some of the manufacturing activities performed at our aizu japan and seremban malaysia facilities to some of our other facilities or to third party contractors   in many cases the volume from closed operations has been or is being shifted to our existing facilities in order to improve capacity utilization facility closures and production shifts have resulted in some reductions in our manufacturing capacity but we do not expect these reductions to affect our ability to meet our foreseeable production needs as part of our 2000 plan described above we completed manufacturing rationalization actions resulting in a reduction of our manufacturing workforce by 27 from approximately 8950 employees as of december 31 2000 to approximately 6500 employees as of december 31 2002 and 19 annualized cost savings of approximately 255 million as compared to our cost structure in the first quarter of 2001 as part of our 2002 plan described above we expect to complete further manufacturing rationalization actions by the fourth quarter of 2003 by december 31 2003 we expect to generate annualized cost savings of approximately 112 million as a result of these actions including approximately 67 million in respect of reduced wages and overhead for staff reductions and shifting manufacturing to lower cost regions 25 million of reductions in materials costs and 20 million in manufacturing process improvements as compared to our cost structure in the third quarter of 2002 

  reducing nonmanufacturing personnel and implementing other cost controls as part of our 2000 plan described above we reduced selling administrative and research and development personnel from approximately 1800 as of june 1 2001 to approximately 1340 as of december 31 2002 approximately 41 of the employees involved in this reduction were in sales or marketingrelated positions approximately 40 were salaried employees in administrative or managerial positions and 19 were employees in research and development positions as of september 27 2002 we had achieved annualized cost savings of approximately 110 million starting in the fourth quarter of 2002 as compared to our cost structure in the first quarter of 2001 as a result of these nonmanufacturing personnel reductions and other cost controls as part of our 2002 plan described above we expect to further reduce selling and administrative personnel by 180 employees by the fourth quarter of 2003 by december 31 2003 we expect to generate annualized cost savings of approximately 13 million as a result of these actions in connection with these reductions we have adopted a more efficient hybrid sales force structure that combines direct sales personnel with sales representatives   the employee figures above exclude employees of our joint venture in leshan china   outlook   we expect the near term market to continue to be challenging but beginning to recover in the latter half of 2003 resulting in a 4 to 5 increase in total revenues for the year to increase our market share in the markets we serve we have launched several initiatives to identify new customers and new opportunities within our existing customer base in selected product areas in addition we have plans to accelerate our new product design in programs worldwide we expect that our gross margins will exceed 30 per quarter by the end of the year assuming among other things the successful launch of new products and market share improvements our research and development expenses should be approximately 6 of total revenues in 2003 our sales and marketing expenses should be approximately 5 of total revenues in 2003 and our general and administrative expenses should sequentially decline until these expenses reach approximately 6 of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2003 we plan to record a tax provision of 3 million per quarter in 2003 given these and certain other expectations we continue to expect to have positive earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2003 see “trends risks and uncertainties” elsewhere in this report   liquidity and capital structure   cash position and capital expenditures   cash flows changed significantly in 2002 as compared to 2001 although our cash balance at december 31 2002 increased by only 26 million as compared to december 31 2001 cash flows provided by operating activities were 306 million in 2002 a 1679 million improvement from the net cash usage of 1373 million in 2001 this increase was primarily the result of reduced costs resulting from the restructuring programs and reduced restructuring payments in 2002 we have as part of a targeted effort to improve our liquidity also reduced our capital expenditures from 1988 million in 2000 to 1179 million in 2001 and 265 million in 2002 we do not expect that our capital expenditure reductions will have a negative impact on our ability to service our customers as we believe that nearterm access to additional manufacturing capacity should it be required could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately 5060 million in 2003   debt refinancing   during 2002 and the first quarter of 2003 we refinanced a portion of our senior bank facilities through the issuance of 3000 million principal amount of our second lien senior secured notes due 2008 and 200 million 20 principal amount of our first lien senior secured notes due 2010 the net proceeds from these two transactions were used to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities in connection with the issuance of the first lien senior secured notes we amended our senior bank facilities to provide us additional financial flexibility by removing the requirement that we maintain certain minimum interest expense coverage ratios and that we do not exceed certain maximum leverage ratios and by reducing to 1400 million our minimum ebitda requirement for any four consecutive fiscal quarters while we also reduced our permitted capital expenditures to 1000 million per year subject to certain increases for improved financial performance and carryovers from prior periods we do not expect this reduction to have a significant impact on our operating plans or financial performance as a result of these refinancings we have extended our debt maturities assuming the first lien senior secured notes had been issued as of december 31 2002 our total debt as of such date would amortize in the annual amounts shown below in millions 

    because the effective interest rates on the first lien and second lien senior secured notes which are fixed are considerably higher than those that currently apply to our senior bank facilities which are floating our interest expense will increase as a result of these refinancings at current rates that apply to our senior bank facilities we expect net interest expense to be approximately 150 million in 2003 other significant events 

 

   effective january 1 2002 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the provisions of sfas no 141 require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized sfas no 141 also requires that upon adoption of sfas no 142 we reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill based on certain criteria sfas no 142 primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition the provisions of sfas no 142 prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and require that such assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill andor indefinitelived intangible assets may be impaired require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and remove the fortyyear limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives goodwill amortization expense totaled 106 million in 2001 21   sfas no 142 requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with the related carrying amount including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary if the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value the second step test must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss if any the second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination with the carrying amount of such goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess   our goodwill at january 1 2002 totaled 773 million and relates to the april 2000 acquisition of cherry semiconductor corporation “cherry” as a result of the adoption of sfas no 142 we discontinued amortization of the cherry goodwill at the beginning of 2002   during the first quarter of 2002 we identified our various reporting units which correspond with our four product lines and allocated its assets and liabilities to such reporting units the goodwill relating to the cherry acquisition was specifically identified with and included in our power management and standard analog reporting unit during the second quarter of 2002 we completed the first step of its transitional goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of the power management and standard analog reporting unit as of january 1 2002 exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying amount by a substantial amount as a result an impairment of the cherry goodwill as of that date was not indicated and completion of the second step test was not required we updated our goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2002 and determined that a related impairment did not exist   as mentioned below in “critical accounting policies” effective january 1 2001 we changed our accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales to distributors recognition of revenue and related gross profit on sales to distributors is now deferred until the distributor resells the product we believe that this change better aligns reported results with focuses us on and allows investors to better understand end user demand for the products that we sell through distributors our new revenue recognition policy is commonly used in the semiconductor industry the cumulative effect of the accounting change for periods prior to january 1 2001 was a charge of 1552 million 1164 million or 067 per share net of income taxes the accounting change resulted in an increase in revenues of 1166 million and a decrease in our net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change of 531 million or 030 per share for the year ended december 31 2001   also effective january 1 2001 we adopted sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended which establishes standards for the accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities our interest rate swaps in effect at january 1 2001 were designated as cash flow hedges were measured at fair value and recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet upon adoption of sfas no 133 we recorded an aftertax charge of 34 million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of january 1 2001 this charge consisted of a 21 million adjustment to record our interest rate swaps in the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values as well as the writeoff of an approximate 35 million pretax deferred charge included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2000 relating to the payment made in december 2000 for the early termination of an interest rate protection agreement relating to a portion of the amounts outstanding under our senior bank facilities both before income taxes of approximately 22 million   in addition to hedging a portion of our interest rate exposure we use forward foreign currency contracts to reduce our overall exposure to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities with gains and losses offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying assets or liabilities the adoption of sfas no 133 did not impact our accounting and reporting for these derivative instruments 22 

 

   on april 3 2000 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of cherry semiconductor corporation “cherry” for approximately 2532 million in cash including acquisition related costs which was financed with cash on hand and borrowings of 2200 million under our senior bank facilities cherry which was renamed semiconductor components industries of rhode island inc designs and manufactures analog and mixed signal integrated circuits for the power management and automotive markets and had revenues for its fiscal year ended february 29 2000 of 1291 million   the cherry acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and as a result the purchase price and related costs were allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of the acquisition based on management estimates as follows in millions    developed technology is being amortized on a straightline basis over an estimated useful life of five years goodwill was being amortized on a straightline basis over an estimated useful life of ten years however as mentioned previously such amortization was discontinued upon the adoption of sfas no 142 additionally assembled workforce was being amortized over an estimated useful life of five years assembled workforce does not meet the sfas no 141 requirements as an intangible asset apart from goodwill accordingly upon adoption of sfas no 142 we reclassified the unamortized balance of assembled workforce to goodwill and the related amortization was discontinued   the fair value of the acquired inprocess research and development was determined using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value significant assumptions that had to be made in using this approach included revenue and operating margin projections and determination of the applicable discount rate the fair value of the acquired inprocess research and development was based on sales forecasts and cost assumptions projected to be achievable by cherry on a standalone basis operating margins were based on cost of goods sold and selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues all projected revenue and cost information was based on historical results and trends and did not include any synergies or cost savings that may result from the acquisition the rate used to discount future projected cash flows resulting from the acquired inprocess research and development was 20 which was derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle   at the date of acquisition the inprocess research and development consisted of sixtyfive projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and for which no alternative future uses had been identified accordingly these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date such projects were approximately 70 to 80 complete at the date of the acquisition the estimated cost to complete these projects at that date was approximately 41 million of the sixtyfive projects in process at the date of acquisition we completed thirtyone projects abandoned twentynine projects and are in the process of completing the remaining five projects which have an estimated completion cost of 05 million subsequent to the acquisition date we experienced an industry downturn that required us to scale back research and development activities due to the decline in product demand subsequent to the acquisition 2002 revenues associated with the completed projects were approximately 125 million or 30 of the amount originally forecasted for all acquired inprocess research and development projects at the date of acquisition critical accounting policies   the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america note 3 “significant accounting policies” of the 23 notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contain a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 

  revenue we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers when title passes to the customer net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances   prior to january 1 2001 we recognized revenue on distributor sales when title passed to the distributor provisions were recorded at that time for estimated sales returns as well as for other related sales costs and allowances effective january 1 2001 we changed our revenue recognition policy for distributor sales so that the related revenues are now deferred until the distributor resells the product to the end user this change eliminated the need to provide for estimated sales returns from distributors title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet we recognize the related revenue and margin when the distributor sells the products to the end user although payment terms vary most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days   we believe that this change better aligns our reported results with focuses us on and enables investors to better understand end user demand for the products we sell through distribution as our revenue is not influenced by our distributors’ stocking decisions   inventories we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand projected end user demand is generally based on sales during the prior twelve months these provisions can influence our results from operations for example when demand falls for a given part all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved impacting our cost of sales and gross profit if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin however the vast majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded although we do sell some products that have previously been written down such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material   deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in determining the amount of the valuation allowance we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense conversely if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2001 we established a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets and throughout 2002 we have not recognized any incremental deferred tax benefits we monitor our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance on an ongoing basis   impairment of longlived assets we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests 24   goodwill and other intangibles we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred sfas no 142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the reporting unit’s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary if the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value the second step test must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss if any the second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination with the carrying amount of such goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess   defined benefit plans we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees for financial reporting purposes net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees all of these assumptions are based upon management’s judgement considering all known trends and uncertainties actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact the future expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans results of operations   the following table summarizes certain

   total revenues total revenues decreased 1301 million or 107 to 10845 million in 2002 from 12146 million in 2001 due to declines in average selling prices of approximately 10 and a reduction of foundry revenues of approximately 7 million the percentage of billings related to new products defined as products introduced within the prior 36 months increased in 2002 as compared to 2001 the revenues by product line for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively are as follows dollars in millions     on a percentage basis the revenue decline has been the most pronounced in our high frequency clock and data management product line as unit demand from the networking and telecommunications end markets continued to decline for our other product lines we experienced an increase in unit demand in 2002 however this was more than offset by decreases in average selling prices resulting in total revenue declines in 2002   approximately 37 44 and 19 of our revenues during 2002 were derived from the americas asia pacific and europe including the middle east respectively compared to 40 38 and 22 respectively during 2001 the change from prior year reflects the continuing recovery of the asia pacific markets and our growth in the china market   cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2002 decreased 2010 million or 201 to 7990 million from 10000 million in 2001 this decrease is attributable to 1752 million of cost reduction activities and 349 million of lower provisions for excess inventories taken during 2002 as compared to 2001 as of the end of the third quarter of 2002 we completed actions to achieve an estimated 255 million of annual cost of sales savings as compared to our cost structure as of the first quarter of 2001 these cost savings were partially offset by an increase in freight expense of 11 million in the second half of 2002 as compared to the second half of 2001 due to the expiration of the freight sharing agreement with motorola during 2002   looking forward we anticipate additional cost savings from our restructuring programs see recent developments above although freight expense in 2003 is expected to increase as compared to 2002 since we benefited from the motorola freight sharing agreement during the first half of 2002 we do not expect our freight cost structure in 2003 to significantly change from that of the last two quarters of 2002   gross profit gross profit computed as total revenues less cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 709 million or 330 to 2855 million from 2146 million in 2001 as a percentage of total revenues gross margin increased to 263 during 2002 from 177 in 2001 to summarize the fluctuations described above the increase in gross margin was attributable to cost improvements from restructuring efforts and lower provisions for excess inventories offset by decreases in average selling prices and an increase in freight expense with the expiration of the freight sharing agreement with motorola 

 

   research and development research and development costs decreased 130 million or 161 to 679 million in 2002 compared with 809 million 2001 primarily as a result of aligning our operating costs with our revenues as a percentage of revenues research and development costs remained fairly consistent at 63 in 2002 as compared to 67 in 2001 our target for research and development costs in 2003 is 27 approximately 6 of total revenues as we continue to focus on new product development the primary emphasis of our new product development efforts is in the expected high growth market applications of high frequency clock and data management and power management and standard analog solutions with approximately 80 of our overall research and development investments focused in these areas during 2002 we introduced 176 new products 

  selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2002 decreased by 136 million or 182 to 612 million compared with 748 million in 2001 as a percentage of revenues selling and marketing expenses for 2002 were 56 compared with 62 in 2001 with the decline attributable to our worldwide restructuring programs restructuring efforts in selling and marketing including the downsizing of our sales force closing of sales offices as well as our regional sales headquarters and centralizing and relocating our order entry functions to lower cost regions were largely enacted during the second quarter of 2001 selling and marketing expenses are targeted at approximately 5 of total revenues in 2003   general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by 288 million or 220 to 1021 million from 1309 million in 2001 as a result of personnel reductions of approximately 30 as compared to 2001 and the relocation of functions to lower cost regions as a percentage of revenues these costs decreased to 94 in 2002 from 108 in 2001 we expect our general and administrative expenses to sequentially decline until these expenses reach approximately 6 of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2003   amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased 107 million to 119 million in 2002 from 226 million 2001 as a result of the adoption of sfas 142 effective january 1 2002 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill see note 3 “significant accounting policies” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report   restructuring and other restructuring and other activity decreased 1227 million to 277 million in 2002 from 1504 million in 2001 as most of our restructuring activities were initiated in 2001 we have 195 million accrued in relation to the 2001 and 2002 programs and expect this amount to be paid over the next year we expect that the savings from these programs will more than offset the expected payments in 2003   during 2002 we recorded charges of 352 million to cover costs associated with our worldwide profitability enhancement programs the charges primarily relate to the consolidation of manufacturing selling and administrative functions in the us and europe the charges included 212 million to cover employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 451 employees asset impairments of 94 million and 46 million of other costs primarily related to facility closures and contract terminations the asset impairments were charged directly against the related assets employee separation costs included 12 million of noncash charges associated primarily with the acceleration of vesting of stock options for terminated employees as of december 31 2002 the remaining liability relating to this restructuring was 166 million as of december 31 2002 approximately 100 employees have been terminated under this restructuring plan   during the second quarter of 2002 we reached a settlement of various contractual issues with motorola in exchange for a cash payment from motorola of 106 million resulting in a related gain of 124 million see note 18 “related party transactions” for further details of the motorola settlement   in december 2002 we recorded a 49 million charge to cover costs associated with the separation of two of our executive officers in connection with the separation we reserved 20 million related to the cash portion of the related separation agreements in addition we agreed to modify the vesting and exercise period for a portion of the executives’ stock options this modification resulted in a noncash stock compensation charge of 29 million with an offsetting credit to additional paidin capital   see note 5 “restructuring and other” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a further discussion of these charges   interest expense interest expense increased 117 million or 88 to 1452 million for 2002 from 1335 million in 2001 the higher interest expense was due to the increased supplemental interest charges of 49 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 resulting from the august 2001 amendments to our senior bank 28 facilities the higher interest expense in 2002 also reflects a full year of interest on the draw on our revolving credit facility that occurred in june 2001 our weightedaverage interest rate on longterm debt including current maturities was 109 per annum and 105 per annum in 2002 and 2001 respectively computed by dividing total interest expense by our average monthend debt balances at current rates that apply to our senior bank facilities we expect net interest expense to be approximately 1500 million in 2003 

  equity in earnings of joint ventures equity in earnings from our joint ventures remained relatively consistent decreasing 01 million to 39 million in 2002 from 40 million in 2001   gain on sale of investment in joint venture we had a 50 interest in smp as a part of the joint venture agreement our joint venture partner philips semiconductors international bv “philips” had the right to purchase our interest in smp between january 2001 and july 2002 in february 2001 philips exercised its purchase right acquiring our 50 interest in smp effective december 31 2000 this transaction resulted in proceeds of approximately 204 million and a pretax gain of approximately 31 million   income tax provision we recognized an income tax provision of 88 million in 2002 compared with 3457 in 2001 the 2002 provision related to income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations the 2001 amount was greatly influenced by our decision to limit the recognition of deferred tax benefits relating to our operating losses to the amount that could be recovered via carryback this decision resulted in an increase of 3668 million in our valuation allowance established for our us tax benefits this was partially offset by deferred tax benefits recognized for certain operating losses incurred outside the us   minority interests minority interests represent the portion of the net loss of our two majorityowned czech subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of each subsidiary we consolidate these subsidiaries in our financial statements losses experienced by these subsidiaries declined in 2002 as compared to 2001 as a result of improved capacity utilization therefore the elimination of minority interests were 0 in 2002 compared to 21 million in 2001   extraordinary loss on debt prepayment extraordinary loss of 65 million in 2002 represents the writeoff of debt issuance costs in connection with the debt refinancing that occurred in 2002 

 

   total revenues total revenues decreased 7441 million or 380 to 12146 million in 2001 from 19587 million in 2000 the decrease occurred in all of our major product lines approximately 10 of this decrease was due to reductions in selling prices with the remaining 28 decline due to reduced volume and changes in our product mix foundry revenues included in our standard components product line decreased by 535 million to 82 million in 2001 from 617 million in 2000 foundry revenues result from agreements made with motorola during our separation and we expect that these revenues will continue to decline in the future   the revenues by product line for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to the pro forma revenues by product line for the year ended december 31 2000 are as follows dollars in millions     as previously discussed beginning in the last quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2001 we experienced slowing demand and pricing pressures for our products as customers delayed or cancelled bookings in order to 29 manage their inventories in line with incoming business however during the third and fourth quarters of 2001 demand for our products began to show signs of stabilization as customer orders across all of our product lines were up from the second quarter of 2001 beginning in the third quarter of 2001 our booktobill ratio increased to higher than 10 and increased further in the fourth quarter of 2001 

  approximately 40 38 and 22 of our total revenues in 2001 were derived from the americas asia pacific and europe including the middle east respectively compared to 47 33 and 20 respectively in 2000 the increase in the asia pacific region reflects our customers’ shift in production into that region   cost of sales cost of sales decreased 2935 million or 227 to 10000 million in 2001 from 12935 million in 2000 as a result of decreased sales volume cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to 823 in 2001 from 660 in 2000 due to lower factory utilization coupled with increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory partially offset by cost savings resulting from our restructuring programs the restructuring programs include the implementation of ongoing costsaving initiatives to rationalize our product portfolio close plants and relocate or outsource related operations to take advantage of lowercost labor markets and make our manufacturing processes more efficient   gross profit gross profit computed as total revenues less cost of sales decreased 4506 million or 677 to 2146 million in 2001 from 6652 million in 2000 as a percentage of total revenues gross margin declined to 177 in 2001 from 340 in 2000 the decline in gross margin was primarily due to lower factory utilization resulting from lower customer demand lower selling prices and a change in mix towards lower margin devices partially offset by cost restructuring initiatives operating expenses   research and development research and development costs increased 117 million or 169 to 809 million in 2001 from 692 million in 2000 as a percentage of total revenues research and development costs increased to 67 in 2001 from 35 in 2000 because of decreased revenues accompanied by increased spending on new product development the primary emphasis of our new product development is on power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management solutions which are the highest margin and fastest potential growth product lines in our portfolio we have targeted 80 of our overall research and development investment on these products we are committed to increase our spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets during 2001 we introduced 344 new products   selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses decreased by 253 million or 253 to 748 million in 2001 from 1001 million in 2000 as a result of our restructuring program as a percentage of total revenues however these costs increased to 62 in 2001 from 51 in 2000 as a result of decreased total revenues that were only partially offset by cost savings resulting from our restructuring actions these actions included the downsizing of our sales force closing of sales offices as well as our regional sales headquarters and centralizing and relocating our order entry function to lower cost locations   general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by 1025 million or 439 to 1309 million in 2001 from 2334 million in 2000 as a result of cost reduction actions from our restructuring program the major reductions were associated with personnel reductions simplification of our overall corporate structure and regional infrastructure elimination of some of our employee bonuses and lower use of consultants as a percentage of total revenues these costs decreased to 108 in 2001 from 119 in 2000   writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development in 2000 we incurred a 269 million charge for the writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development resulting from the cherry acquisition no such charges were incurred in 2001   amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was 226 million in 2001 compared to 168 million in 2000 the amortization relates to the intangible assets that were acquired with cherry in the second quarter of 2000 including amounts related to developed technology assembled workforce and goodwill in 2001 we had a full year of related amortization expenses as compared to only nine months of amortization in 2000 30   restructuring and other during 2001 we recorded charges of 1466 million to cover costs associated with our worldwide profitability enhancement programs the charges relate to the consolidation of selling and administrative functions in the us and europe phasing out manufacturing operations at our guadalajara mexico facility transferring certain manufacturing activities performed at our aizu japan and seremban malaysia facilities to other facilities we own or to third party contractors and consolidation of other operations the charges included 804 million to cover employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 4350 employees asset impairments of 562 million and 100 million of other costs primarily related to facility closures and contract terminations the asset impairments were charged directly against the related assets employee separation costs included 13 million of noncash charges associated primarily with the acceleration of vesting of stock options for terminated employees and 74 million for additional pension charges related to terminated employees as of december 31 2001 the remaining liability relating to this restructuring was 198 million as of december 31 2001 approximately 3500 employees have been terminated under this restructuring plan   in march 2001 we recorded a 38 million charge to cover costs associated with the separation of one of our executive officers in connection with the separation we paid the former executive officer 19 million in addition we agreed to accelerate the vesting of his remaining stock options and to allow such options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their tenyear term we recorded a noncash charge of 19 million related to the modification of these options   during 2000 we recorded a 56 million charge to cover costs associated with a restructuring program at our manufacturing facility in guadalajara mexico the charge included 32 million to cover employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 500 employees and 24 million for asset impairments that were charged directly against the related assets in september 2000 we completed our evaluation of costs to be incurred and released 08 million of the reserve for employee separation costs to income as of december 31 2001 there was no remaining liability relating to the 2000 restructuring program   see note 5 “restructuring and other” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a further discussion of our restructuring activity   operating income loss operating income loss decreased 4590 million or 2145 to a 2450 million loss in 2001 from operating income of 2140 million in 2000 this decrease was due to decreased gross profits resulting from reduced product revenues lower factory utilization and inventory charges increased research and development costs increased amortization of goodwill and other intangibles and restructuring and other charges offset by reduced selling marketing and general and administrative costs resulting from our restructuring actions and the lack of the acquired inprocess research and development writeoff which occurred in 2000 as a result of these efforts we incurred restructuring and other charges of 1504 million in 2001   interest expense interest expense increased 23 million or 18 to 1335 million in 2001 from 1312 million in 2000 the increase was due to interest related to the 1250 million drawn on our revolving line of credit in may 2001 as well as increased interest rates related to the amendments to our senior bank facilities see “liquidity and capital resources” below and note 9 “longterm debt” of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report the increase in interest expense was partially offset by the redemption of a portion of the senior subordinated notes and prepayment of a portion of the loans outstanding under the senior bank facilities with the proceeds from our ipo during 2000   equity in earnings of joint ventures equity in earnings from joint ventures decreased 04 million to 40 million in 2001 from 44 million in 2000 due primarily to the sale of our interest in our semiconductor miniatures products malaysia sdn bhd “smp” joint venture effective december 31 2000 offset by an increase in earnings from our leshan joint venture   gain on sale of investment in joint venture we had a 50 interest in smp as a part of the joint venture agreement our joint venture partner philips semiconductors international bv “philips” had the right to purchase our interest in smp between january 2001 and july 2002 in february 2001 philips exercised its purchase right acquiring our 50 interest in smp effective december 31 2000 this transaction resulted in proceeds of approximately 204 million and a pretax gain of approximately 31 million 31   minority interests minority interests represent the portion of the net income loss of our two majorityowned czech subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of each subsidiary we consolidate these subsidiaries in our financial statements minority interests in the subsidiaries’ losses income were 21 million in 2001 compared to 22 million in 2000 due to lower capacity utilization during 2001   income tax provision the provision for income taxes increased in 2001 to 3457 million from 367 million in 2000 during the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a 3668 million income tax charge to establish a valuation allowance for the portion of our deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized when coupled with the tax benefits relating to the 2001 operating loss that were not recognized during the year our valuation allowance totaled 4506 million at december 31 2001 we established the valuation allowance based upon management’s analysis of the information available which included among other things the operating loss experienced during the year as well as uncertainties surrounding the timing of the recovery in economic conditions both generally as well as with the semiconductor industry our 2001 effective tax rate after valuation allowance is 931 as compared to 356 in 2000 see note 10 “income taxes” of notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report liquidity and capital resources   in this section of the management discussion and analysis segment we are going to discuss   1 sources and uses of cash and significant factors that influence both   2 key events affecting our capital structure   3 our analysis of our cash flows for 2002 and   4 our commitments and contractual obligations   all of these factors are important to an understanding of our ability to meet our current obligations to fund working capital to finance expansion either by internal means or through the acquisition of other businesses or to pay down existing debt   to summarize our current status our operating activities provided cash of 306 million in 2002 and 3013 million in 2000 and used cash of 1373 million in 2001 at december 31 2002 we had 1824 million in cash and cash equivalents net working capital of 1950 million term or revolving debt of 14032 million and a stockholders’ deficit of 6621 million our longterm debt includes 7016 million under our senior bank facilities 2914 million net of discount of our 12 second lien senior secured notes due 2008 2600 million of our 12 senior subordinated notes due 2009 1269 million under a 10 junior subordinated note payable to motorola due 2011 and 233 million under a note payable to a japanese bank due 2010 we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our various debt agreements as of december 31 2002 and expect to remain in compliance over the next twelve months   sources and uses of cash   we require cash to fund our operating expenses including working capital requirements and outlays for research and development to make capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments and to pay debt service including principal and interest and capital lease payments our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances in the near term we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand and targeted asset sales including our guadalajara mexico site which is currently on the market for sale additionally as part of our business strategy we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis   we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include  32    our ability to service our longterm debt to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to among other things our future operating performance as well as to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other conditions some of which may beyond our control   if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or if available will be at rates or prices acceptable to us although there can be no assurance we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash balances will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through december 31 2003 to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans our liquidity may be adversely impacted   key events affecting our capital structure

   on july 9 2002 we received a notice from nasdaq advising us that we were not in compliance with the nasdaq national market’s minimum bid price requirement marketplace rule 4450 b4 because our 34 common stock had traded below 300 per share for 30 consecutive trading days and that if we were unable to demonstrate compliance with this requirement by october 7 2002 nasdaq would provide us written notification that our securities would be delisted because our stock had not closed above 282 a share since july 9 2002 it seemed unlikely that we would have regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement on october 2 2002 we requested a transfer of the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market on october 22 2002 nasdaq approved our transfer and effective october 25 2002 our common stock began trading on the nasdaq smallcap market as the nasdaq smallcap market does not have the same trading volume as the nasdaq national market our stock may become more volatile and there can be no assurances that a ready market will exist movement from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market does not prevent us from issuing additional securities however pricing of an offering may be more difficult given the less liquid nature of the nasdaq smallcap market if later we are able to meet the applicable listing requirements of the nasdaq national market once again we may apply to list our common stock on the nasdaq national market 

 

   cash flow information for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 are as follows in millions  35    for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 we have provided 26 million and utilized 91 million in cash respectively however the makeup of the cash flow from operations investing and financing activities has been quite different in these periods the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 shows an improvement in cash flows from operations of 1679 million a reduction in the net cash used in investing activities of 673 million and a decrease of 2237 million in cash flows from financing activities   we generated 306 million in cash flow from operations during 2002 relative to cash used in operations of 1373 million in 2001 this 1679 million improvement is primarily the result of reduced costs resulting from our restructuring program and reduced restructuring payments   we used 220 million in net cash from investing activities in 2002 as compared to 893 million in 2001 the decline was the result of lower capital equipment spending our need for incremental property plant or equipment has been significantly reduced given the current level of business furthermore our senior bank facilities restrict the amount of capital equipment we can purchase within certain periods as a result we have been selective in purchasing new equipment   financing activities during 2002 have resulted in net cash used of 70 million versus net cash provided in 2001 of 2167 million during 2002 we refinanced a portion of our long term debt by issuing 3000 million of senior secured notes and using the net cash proceeds of 2786 million net of discount and issuance costs and additional funds to prepay debt principal of 2833 million of our senior bank facilities in contrast in 2001 we drew on our 1250 million revolving credit facility and received net proceeds of 992 million from the issuance of redeemable preferred stock to help fund the cash used in operations and equipment purchases needed at the time 36 

 

   while earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity it is included herein to provide additional information with respect to our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditure and working capital requirements this calculation may differ in method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies the following table sets forth our ebitda for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 with a reconciliation to cash flows from operations the most directly comparable financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles    as discussed in note 9 “longterm debt” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report our debt covenants require us to maintain minimum adjusted ebitda levels as defined by our credit agreement this adjusted ebitda computation excludes restructuring and certain other charges and includes among other things the ebitda of our leshan china joint venture therefore ebitda in the above table is not representative of the adjusted ebitda used to determine our debt covenant compliance 

 

   our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our senior bank facilities other longterm debt operating leases purchase obligations pension obligations and our redeemable preferred stock the following 37 table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2002 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 

amount of commitment by expiration period  payments due by period    our longterm debt includes 7016 million under senior bank facilities 2914 million of senior secured notes net of unamortized discount 2600 million of senior subordinated notes due 2009 1269 million under the junior subordinated note payable to motorola and 233 million under a note payable to a japanese bank   in the normal course of our business we enter into various operating leases for equipment including our mainframe computer system desktop computers communications foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment   in addition we have the following purchase obligations at december 31 2002    finally our other longterm commitments consist of estimated payments relating to our us and foreign pension plans see note 14 “employee benefit plans” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report in regards to the us pension plan we reevaluated our current assumptions in light of the actual returns experienced current annuity rates and the expected termination of the us pension plan as of december 31 2004 with the subsequent payment of benefits in 2005 we expect pension expense to be approximately 27 million over the remaining life of the plan with a related cash funding requirement of 36 million upon the termination of the us pension plan we are under an obligation to ensure that the plan has assets sufficient to pay accrued benefits   our series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock is redeemable at the holder’s option anytime after september 7 2009 the preferred stock has a cumulative dividend payable quarterly in cash at the rate of 80 per annum or if greater during the relevant quarterly period in an amount equal to the value of the dividends that would be paid on the common stock then issuable upon conversion of the preferred 38 stock compounded to the extent not paid and subject to restrictions under the company’s senior bank facilities senior subordinated notes and other documents relating to the company’s indebtedness the amount shown in the table above assumes no redemption of the preferred stock or payments of accrued dividends until september 7 2009 

  the table above does not include any obligations we may have in the future to purchase products from our joint venture in leshan china we were obligated to purchase 85 81 and 86 of leshan’s production capacity in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively which resulted in purchases including underutilization charges from our leshan joint venture of 882 million 520 million and 620 million of products respectively during such periods for 2003 we are obligated to purchase 82 of the expected production capacity at leshan during the year   in november 2000 our leshan joint venture entered into a 200 million loan agreement with a chinese bank the loan has a variable interest rate requires quarterly interest payments and principal payments on the third anniversary of the loan draw and is secured with certain assets of the joint venture   in june 2002 we obtained approval from the chinese government for our leshan joint venture to invest up to 231 million for semiconductor operations which is in addition to the 278 million originally approved at december 31 2002 our total investment in and advances to the joint venture was 993 million including loans of 633 million in august 2002 our joint venture began construction on a 6inch wafer fabrication facility in leshan during 2003 we plan to spend approximately 5 million on construction of the fabrication building and will determine the timing for additional capital expenditures based on endmarket demand and our overall capacity utilization   for additional information on our leshan joint venture see note 8 “investments in joint ventures” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and part i item 1 “business — manufacturing operations” in each case included elsewhere in this report recent accounting pronouncements   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” under this standard asset retirement obligations will be recognized when incurred at their estimated fair value in addition the cost of the asset retirement obligation will be capitalized as a part of the assets’ carrying valued and depreciated over the assets’ remaining useful life we will be required to adopt sfas no 143 effective january 1 2003 we do not expect the implementation of sfas no 143 to have a material effect on our results of operations   we adopted sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” effective january 1 2002 sfas no 144 requires that all longlived assets including discontinued operations that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell additionally sfas no 144 expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction our adoption of sfas no 144 did not impact our financial condition or results of operations   in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fas nos 4 44 and 64 amendment of fas 13 and technical corrections as of april 2002” sfas no 145 rescinds sfas no 4 “reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt” and an amendment of that statement sfas no 64 “extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinkingfund requirements” and excludes extraordinary item treatment for gains and losses associated with the extinguishment of debt that do not meet the accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operations — reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” criteria any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in apb no 30 for classification as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified sfas no 145 also amends fasb statement no 13 accounting for leases” and amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions we are required to adopt sfas no 145 effective january 1 39 2003 while the adoption of sfas no 145 will require reclassifications of amounts within our statement of operations there will be no impact on the our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas no 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” sfas no 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred under eitf no 943 a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf no 943 was recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan the provisions of sfas no 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated by us after december 31 2002   in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure — an amendment to fas 123” sfas no 148 provides alternative methods of transition for voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation sfas no 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format additionally sfas no 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in annual and interim financial statements the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 148 are effective for fiscal year 2002 the interim disclosure requirements are effective for the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 we have no plans to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation   in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 “fin no 45” “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin no 45 requires a guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee fin no 45 also expands the disclosures required to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified the disclosure requirements are effective immediately and such disclosures have been included in note 7 “balance sheet information” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report we do not expect the adoption of fin no 45 to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations   in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 “fin no 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” fin no 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties fin 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january 31 2003 for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin no 46 must be applied to the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2003 additionally certain transitional disclosures are required immediately if it is reasonably possible that we will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when fin no 46 becomes effective we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin no 46 will have on the accounting for our investment in leshanphoenix semiconductor ltd as well as the related impact on our results of operations and financial condition we have included the transitional disclosures required by fin no 46 in note 8 “investment in joint ventures” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report trends risks and uncertainties   this annual report on form 10k includes “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all statements other than statements of historical facts included or incorporated in this form 10k are forwardlooking statements particularly statements about our plans strategies and prospects under the headings “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “business” 40 forwardlooking statements are often characterized by the use of words such as “believes” “estimates” “expects” “projects” “may” “will” “intends” “plans” or “anticipates” or by discussions of strategy plans or intentions all forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are made based on our current expectations and estimates which involve risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements among these factors are changes in overall economic conditions the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry changes in demand for our products changes in inventories at our customers and distributors technological and product development risks availability of raw materials competitors’ actions loss of key customers order cancellations or reduced bookings changes in manufacturing yields control of costs and expenses significant litigation risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions risks associated with our substantial leverage and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements our transfer to the nasdaq smallcap market including impairment of the marketability and liquidity of our common stock the impairment of our ability to raise capital and other risks associated with trading on the nasdaq smallcap market risks associated with our international operations the threat or occurrence of international armed conflict and terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally and risks involving environmental or other governmental regulation additional factors that could affect our future results or events are described from time to time in our securities and exchange commission reports see in particular the description of trends risks and uncertainties that is set forth below and similar disclosures in subsequently filed reports readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements we assume no obligation to update such information 

  you should carefully consider the trends risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this form 10k and subsequent reports filed with the securities and exchange commission before making any investment decision with respect to our securities if any of the following trends risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected the trading prices of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment all forwardlooking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement   effective january 1 2001 we changed our accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales to distributors recognition of revenue and related gross profit on sales to distributors is now deferred until the distributor resells the product in the risk factors set forth below we have generally restated financial information on a pro forma basis for periods prior to 2001 to reflect the change in revenue recognition on sales to distributors trends risks and uncertainties related to our business we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses and we may experience additional declines in revenues and operating losses in the future   our historical financial results have been and our future financial results are anticipated to be subject to substantial fluctuations our total revenues for 2002 were 10845 million compared to 12146 million for 2001 and 19587 million in 2000 this decline was due primarily to reduced demand for our products resulting from the current economic slowdown and declines in the average selling prices for our products we incurred a net loss for 2002 of 1419 million compared to a net loss of 8314 million for 2001 and net income of 308 million in 2000 the most recent downturn in our business has been most pronounced with respect to our high frequency clock and data management products net revenues from high frequency clock and data management products represented 720 million 1185 million and 2959 million or 66 98 and 151 of the total revenues in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively   reduced enduser demand continued price declines underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business in the near term and we may experience additional declines in revenue and operating losses in the future in order to return to profitability we must successfully implement our business plan including our cost reduction initiatives however we also currently face an environment of uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address we cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that we will be able to sustain our profitability if achieved 41 we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturns   the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical the industry has experienced significant downturns often in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the enduser products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past are currently experiencing a significant and prolonged downturn and may experience such downturns in the future the most recent downturn which began in the fourth quarter of 2000 has been severe and prolonged and it is uncertain when any meaningful recovery will occur future downturns in the semiconductor industry may also be severe and prolonged future downturns in the semiconductor industry or any failure of the industry to fully recover from its recent downturn could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business financial condition and results of operations   during the 1990s and continuing into 2000 the semiconductor industry enjoyed unprecedented growth benefiting from the rapid expansion of the internet and other computing and communications technologies during 2001 we — like many of our customers and competitors — were adversely affected by a general economic slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the enduser products that incorporate our integrated circuits and standard semiconductors the impact of slowing endcustomer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of equipment and component inventories among our original equipment manufacturer subcontractor and distributor customers resulting in increasing pricing pressure we expect that factors including but not limited to economic uncertainty and downturns relating to the threat or actual occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks reduced demand for enduser products underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and changes in our revenue mix could adversely impact our operating results in the near term our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors including our level of capacity utilization   semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment leading to high fixed costs including depreciation expense if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins the decline in product orders and shipments in 2001 resulted in reduced capacity utilization of our facilities as we have attempted to match production with anticipated customer demand from 2000 to 2001 gross margins declined primarily due to lower factory utilization resulting from lower customer demand lower selling prices and a change in product mix towards lower margin devices partially offset by cost reduction initiatives as a percentage of total revenues gross margin was 263 for 2002 compared to 177 for 2001 and 340 in 2000 although our gross margin has improved between 2001 and 2002 gross margin declined between the third and fourth quarters of 2002 and we anticipate a further decline of 200 to 300 basis points in the first quarter of 2003 as a result of pricing pressure increased competition and other factors may lead to further price erosion lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future the failure to implement as well as the completion and impact of our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business   during 2000 2001 and 2002 we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in response to the significant downturn in our industry these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions transitioning highercost external supply to internal manufacturing working with our material suppliers to further lower costs personnel reductions reductions in employee compensation temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead however we cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will in and of themselves return us to profitability   we recorded restructuring charges of 48 million in 2000 1466 million in 2001 and 352 million in 2002 to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments the impact of these restructuring actions on our ability to effectively compete is subject to risks and uncertainties because our restructuring activities involve changes to 42 many aspects of our business the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings there may be other unforeseeable factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 

if we are unable to implement our business strategy our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected   our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes without limitation plans to 1 maintain and refine our product portfolio 2 continue to develop leading edge customer support services 3 expand further our justintime delivery capabilities 4 increase our die manufacturing capacity in a costeffective manner 5 reduce further the number of our product platforms and process flows 6 continue to manage our existing portfolio of products aggressively 7 rationalize our manufacturing operations 8 relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions 9 reduce selling and administrative expenses 10 reduce capital expenditures 11 actively manage working capital 12 develop new products in a more efficient manner and 13 focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations in particular we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential increase our volume or revenue rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses   our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably each of these factors depends on our ability among other things to finance our operating and product development activities maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a costeffective and timely manner protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy such as risks associated with international operations the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities increased competition legal developments and general economic conditions are beyond our control in addition circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy we may require additional capital in the future and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us   we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with the cash that we expect to generate from our operations and sales of assets in the ordinary course of business will be sufficient to meet our planned capital needs for 2003 however it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to fund our future activities or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses products or technologies as of december 31 2002 we have 79 million of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility subject to the restrictions contained in our senior bank facilities and the indentures governing the notes our second lien senior secured notes due 2008 and our senior subordinated notes due 2009 we may be able to raise these funds by selling securities to the public or selected investors or by borrowing money the transfer of our common stock from the nasdaq national market system to the nasdaq smallcap market which was effective as of october 25 2002 may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling securities we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available we may be required to curtail our operations significantly reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development make selective dispositions of our assets or obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets or otherwise impair our ability to remain competitive 43 we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business   the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive the primary emphasis of our new product development is in the power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management solutions with 80 of our overall research and development investment targeted in these areas our longterm target for research and development expenditures is 6 of our total revenues uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of and payment for our products could adversely affect our business   our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers generally our terms and conditions allow our customers to cancel orders up to 30 days prior to shipment we routinely purchase inventory based on customers’ estimates of demand for their products which is difficult to predict this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers or both as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties in addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason the cancellation or deferral of product orders the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers   during 2001 the markets in which our customers operate were characterized by a dramatic decline in enduser demand and continued high levels of channel inventories which reduced visibility of future demand for our products and in some cases led to delays in payments for our products in 2002 short customer lead times prevail given the overcapacity in the industry and we believe that these and other factors could adversely affect our revenues in the near term an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products   rapidly changing technologies and industry standards along with frequent new product introductions characterize the industries that are currently the primary endusers of semiconductors as these industries evolve and introduce new products our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and costeffective manner by designing developing manufacturing marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies   we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and endusers and adapt to such changes in a timely and costeffective manner nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or endusers could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs   the semiconductor industry particularly the market for semiconductor components is highly competitive as a result of the recent economic downturn competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as manufacturers of semiconductor components offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches in addition companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future the semiconductor 44 components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness 

  many of our competitors may have certain advantages over us including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development engineering manufacturing marketing and distribution of their products longer independent operating histories and presence in key markets patent protection and greater name recognition   because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits applicationspecific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products   we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price quality technical performance product features product system compatibility customized design strategic relationships with customers new product innovation availability delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used such as personal computers industrial and telecommunications equipment consumer electronics and automotive goods our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control including industry and general economic trends unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency our future profitability could be adversely affected   manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors   from time to time we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of among other things capacity constraints construction delays transferring production to other facilities upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies any of which could result in a loss of future revenues our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing technology and equipment to remain competitive   semiconductor manufacturing has historically required and in the future is likely to continue to require a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices we maintain certain of our own manufacturing assembly and test facilities which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume we have reduced our capital expenditures from 1988 million in 2000 to 1179 million in 2001 and 265 million in 2002 capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately 5060 million in 2003   we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment in addition our principal credit agreement limits the amount of our capital expenditures 45 if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected   product sales to our ten largest customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 52 46 and 53 of our total revenues in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and in the past we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered generally our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services or increases in the prices of such goods or services could adversely affect our operations and productivity   our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials including silicon wafers copper lead frames mold compound ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases generally our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a justintime basis from time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry   in addition for some of our products such as our new silicon germanium sige technology we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers   we also use thirdparty contractors for some of our manufacturing activities primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods these contract manufacturers including hynix ait ase and phenitec accounted for approximately 30 31 and 40 of our cost of sales in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and in some cases require longerterm commitments in the early stages of the relationship our operations could be adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated the cost of such services increased significantly the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect   in the case of motorola we agreed to continue providing manufacturing services to each other including motorola’s manufacturing of our emittercoupled logic products for limited periods of time following our recapitalization under our agreements with motorola the prices of these services are fixed at levels that are intended to approximate each party’s cost of providing the services we fulfilled our minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from motorola in 2002 we could be adversely affected if we are unable to relocate these manufacturing operations to our own facilities or to other thirdparty manufacturers on costeffective terms or make other satisfactory arrangements prior to the time when these agreements expire acquisitions and strategic alliances may harm our operating results or cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities or dilute our stockholders   we may in the future acquire and form strategic alliances relating to other businesses products and technologies successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require among other things efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts the difficulties of integration and alignment may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations the complexity of the technologies being integrated and aligned and the necessity of 46 integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures the integration and alignment of operations following an acquisition or alliance requires the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the daytoday business and may disrupt key research and development marketing or sales efforts in addition we may issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions or alliances which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances which could harm our operating results without strategic acquisitions and alliances we may have difficulty meeting future customer product and service requirements 

our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations   approximately 40 38 and 22 of our total revenues in 2001 and 37 44 and 19 of our total revenues in 2002 were derived from the americas the asia pacific region and europe including the middle east respectively we maintain significant operations in seremban malaysia carmona the philippines aizu japan leshan china roznov the czech republic and piestany the slovak republic in addition we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asia pacific region   we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets risks inherent in doing business on an international level include among others the following    our activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations if we fail to attract and retain highlyskilled personnel our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate   our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled technical managerial marketing and finance personnel the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive for example analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel as employee incentives we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting recently our stock price has declined substantially reducing the effectiveness of these incentives loss of the services of or failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel including senior managers and design engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 47 we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties and litigation could arise in the future if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use our business could be adversely affected   we rely on patents trade secrets trademarks mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that    in addition our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries   also we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing thirdparty patents or other intellectual property rights motorola has agreed to indemnify us for a limited period of time with respect to some claims that our activities infringe on the intellectual property rights of others if necessary or desirable we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights however we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies litigation could cause us to incur significant expense by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation we may be required to    we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms any such development acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources   we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies including technologies that may not be patented or patentable in part by confidentiality agreements and if applicable inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators advisors employees and consultants we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 48 we are party to securities class action litigation which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain   in july 2001 three stockholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against us certain of our current and former officers and directors and various investment banking firms who acted as underwriters in connection with our initial public offering in may 2000 in april 2002 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed the amended complaint generally alleges that our offering documents failed to disclose certain underwriting fees and commissions and underwriter tieins and other arrangements with certain customers of the underwriters that impacted the price of our common stock in the aftermarket the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages on july 15 2002 together with other issuer defendants we filed a collective motion to dismiss the class action lawsuit this motion is currently pending and oral argument was heard on november 1 2002 on february 19 2003 as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws the court dismissed these claims with prejudice as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws the court denied the motion to dismiss these claims we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these proceedings will be decided in our favor   we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this securities litigation any conclusion of this litigation in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the cost to us of defending the litigation even if resolved in our favor could be substantial such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of this litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition   our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which among other things regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola’s ownership occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our recapitalization transaction we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances however we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs in addition the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization   we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and any liability for currently known environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects however we cannot predict  49 terrorist attacks such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington dc on september 11 2001 or threats or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades the markets in which we operate and our profitability   on september 11 2001 the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope these attacks have led to other acts of terrorism since september 11 2001 the threat or occurrences of international armed conflict or other terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades the market in which we operate and our profitability the terrorist attacks have caused instability in the global financial markets and contributed to downward pressure on stock prices of united states publicly traded companies such as ours future or threatened terrorist attacks or occurrences of international armed conflict could result in greater economic instability and further depress stock prices including the price of our common stock   the september 11 attacks and other terrorist attacks have disrupted the global insurance and reinsurance industries and we may experience delays in renewing some insurance policies and may not be able to obtain insurance at historical levels on all of our facilities future terrorist attacks or occurrences of international armed conflict could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such conflicts and hostilities could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our joint ventures suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere our primary facilities are located in the united states malaysia the philippines japan the czech republic and slovakia in connection with our joint venture we also have facilities in china in addition these sorts of activities may make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult or cost prohibitive any impairment of our financial performance as a result of terrorist attacks or armed conflict could increase the risk of noncompliance with the financial covenants in our principal credit agreement resulting in events of default and the possible acceleration of our indebtedness   due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally we cannot provide any reliable measure of the impact that these terrorist attacks have had on our recent financial performance or any estimate as to how these sorts of attacks and activities might affect our future results trends risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business   we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations as of december 31 2002 we had total longterm indebtedness of 14032 million including current maturities but excluding unused commitments and interest expense of 1452 million for the year ended december 31 2002 also we may incur additional debt in the future subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments   the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to you including  50    as a condition to the august 2001 modifications to the covenants under our senior bank facilities we agreed to specified increases in the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings and the imposition of supplemental interest charges these supplemental interest charges decreased in may 2002 because proceeds from the sale of our second lien senior secured notes due 2008 were used to reduce total borrowings under our senior bank facilities to below 750 million we may incur more debt which could exacerbate the risks described above   we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness but do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ current debt levels the related risks that we and they now face could intensify some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness 

 

   our debt agreements contain and any future debt agreements may include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on among other things our ability to    in addition our senior bank facilities require that we maintain or achieve a minimum consolidated ebitda and a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

 

   if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities further if we are unable to repay 51 refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments including the notes 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations   our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which will be affected by a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as refinancing or restructuring our debt selling additional assets reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness as of march 7 2003 86 million of our 625 million revolving credit facility was available reflecting outstanding loans of 375 million and outstanding letters of credit of 164 million as of january 9 2003 we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than 25 million we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible that any assets could be sold or if sold of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms if at all or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect as a result of our debt refinancing in 2003 we expect that our average interest expense will increase by approximately 138 million per year our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations trends risks and uncertainties related to our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline   given the nature of the markets in which we participate we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations a large portion of our costs are fixed due in part to our significant sales research and development and manufacturing costs thus small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include  52  

 

   in september 2001 we sold 10000 shares of our series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock to tpg on holdings llc an affiliate of the texas pacific group each share of series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder into approximately 3546 shares of our common stock as of the issue date excluding shares into which the preferred stock is convertible due to accumulated and unpaid dividends and subject to customary antidilution adjustments under the antidilution provisions the conversion price is subject to downward adjustment in the event we issue common stock or derivative securities entitling the holder to subscribe for or acquire common stock at a price below the thencurrent conversion price or market price holders of series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock are entitled to cumulative dividends payable quarterly in cash at a rate of 8 per annum or if greater during the relevant quarterly period in an amount equal to the value of the dividends that would be paid on our common stock then issuable upon conversion of the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock subject to applicable restrictions imposed by our principal credit facility in the event dividends are not paid the dividends will accumulate on a compounded basis and the number of shares of common stock into which the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock is convertible will increase proportionately   there is a possibility that the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock will be converted at a price per share that is less than the then current market price of our common stock if this were to occur it may cause substantial dilution to our existing common stockholders additionally we registered the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock under the securities act for public resale therefore in the event that the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock is converted a substantial number of shares of our common stock may be sold into the market which could decrease the trading price of our common stock and encourage short sales by the selling shareholder or others short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock in addition to the series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock we may issue more stock in the future which may cause dilution and a decline in the price of our common stock 

 

   the stock markets in general and the markets for high technology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock   the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors some of which are beyond our control    as of march 7 2002 the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has ranged from a high of 2775 on may 1 2000 to a low of 089 on october 4 2002 53 

 

   affiliates of texas pacific group own 124999433 shares of our common stock and all of the outstanding shares of series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock as of march 7 2003 these shares represented over 76 of the total voting power of our capital stock as a result texas pacific group through its affiliates will be able to    in addition our certificate of incorporation provides that the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which relate to business combinations with interested stockholders do not apply to us 

 

   in july 2002 we received a notice from nasdaq advising us that we were not in compliance with the nasdaq national market’s minimum bid price requirement marketplace rule 4450b4 since we did not believe we would regain compliance in a timely manner with the minimum bid price requirement in october 2002 we requested a transfer of the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market nasdaq approved our transfer and effective october 25 2002 we began trading on the nasdaq smallcap market as the nasdaq smallcap market does not have the same trading volume as the nasdaq national market our stock may become more volatile and there can be no assurances that a ready market will exist certain market makers and analysts may elect not to follow us as a result of our transfer from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market movement from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market does not prevent us from issuing additional securities however pricing of an offering may be more difficult given the less liquid nature of the nasdaq smallcap market 

 

   our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions    although we believe these provisions make a higher thirdparty bid more likely by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 54 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate these risks we utilize derivative financial instruments we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes   at december 31 2002 our longterm debt including current maturities totaled 14032 million we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt which totaled 7016 million we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the 7016 million outstanding balance on our senior bank facilities due to its variable interest rate pricing however from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap to reduce this exposure as of december 31 2002 we had two interest rate swaps covering 1550 million of our variable interest rate debt a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would not materially change our expected annual interest expense of 150 million for the next twelve months   a majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however as a multinational business we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments this strategy reduces but does not eliminate the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements for example changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure
