agriculture and turf operations 

operating model  john deere’s production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf segments together offer a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts as mentioned in the description of the smart industrial operating model the segments are aligned around production systems enabling focus on delivering equipment technology and solutions across all the jobs customers execute during a season sales and marketing support for both the production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf segments continues to be organized around four geographic customer focus areas 

business environment  sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and government policies including global trade policies the amount and timing of government payments and policies related to climate change sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farmland prices farmers’ 

debt levels and access to financing interest and exchange rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels labor availability and costs energy costs tax policies and other input costs associated with farming other key factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers 

innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output these customers are increasingly adopting and integrating precision agricultural technologies like guidance telematics and data management in their operations the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the us and canada and a large proportion of sales in many countries outside the us and canada are comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters selfpropelled sprayers and seeding equipment however small tractors are an important part of our global tractor business further john deere offers a number of harvesting solutions to support development of the mechanized harvesting of grain oilseeds cotton sugarcane and biomass 

retail sales of lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors residential and commercial mowers utility vehicles and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions 

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment can result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand to achieve efficient utilization of personnel and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment john deere offers early order programs which can include discounts to retail customers that place orders well in advance of the use season production schedules are based in part on these early order programs however during periods of high demand some factories may still produce after the use season the production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf segments can incur substantial seasonal variations in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural and turf equipment the segments also incur costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during nonuse seasons in australia canada and the us there are typically several used equipment tradein transactions that take place in connection with most new agricultural equipment sales to provide support to its dealers in these countries for carrying and ultimately selling this used inventory to retail customers john deere provides these dealers with pools of funds awarded as a percentage of the dealer cost for eligible new equipment sales at the time of the new equipment settlement 

retail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third fiscal quarters john deere has pursued a strategy of building and shipping such equipment as close to retail demand as possible consequently to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories throughout the year production and shipment schedules of these product lines are normally proportionately higher in the second and third fiscal quarters of each year corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales however in 2022 supply constraints impacted production schedules resulting in higher than usual shipments in the fourth quarter

risk factors

tableend the following risks are considered material to john deere’s business based upon current knowledge information and assumptions this discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations including the risks and uncertainties described in the forwardlooking statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements these risk factors and other forwardlooking statements relate to future events expectations trends and operating periods and involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business while others could affect all the company’s businesses although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated the risks described in this annual report on form 10k and the “forwardlooking statements” in this report are not the only risks faced by the company 

​ 

strategic risks 

international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deere’s profitability and growth prospects 

international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of john deere’s products services and technology or those of our customers including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deere’s global business john deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and highquality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements negotiation of new trade agreements nontariff trade barriers local content requirements and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products including developments in uschina trade relations and sanctions against russia have limited and could continue to limit john deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deere’s ability to expand the business these trade restrictions and changes in or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies may affect john deere’s competitive position policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure additionally changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment as well as create unequal competition for multinational companies relative to domestic companies 

greater political economic and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deere’s competition customer base and product offerings and impact john deere’s growth opportunities globally 

john deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend in part upon access to additional geographic markets including but not limited to argentina brazil china india and south africa and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deere’s other markets having business operations in various regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and are often complex and difficult to navigate including those related to tariffs and trade regulations investments property ownership rights taxation repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the company’s financial results while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brands are less known in some emerging markets which could impede john deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets 

in addition changing us export controls and sanctions on china as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving china and chinese parties could affect john deere’s ability to collect receivables provide aftermarket warranty support for john deere equipment sell products and otherwise impact john deere’s reputation and business 

the conflict between russia and ukraine could adversely impact our business and financial results 

on february 24 2022 john deere suspended shipments of machines and service parts to russia and belarus after assessing the impact of the russia and ukraine conflict on our operations within russia our senior management in the us decided to initiate a 

voluntary employeeseparation program which reduced overall headcount in russia we may further reduce or discontinue operations in russia depending on the continued evolution of the conflict monetary currency or payment controls restrictions on access to financial institutions supply and transportation challenges sanctions and export controls and countersanctions or other circumstances and considerations our us senior management continues to closely monitor all risks to john deere operations in the region the broader consequences of the russia and ukraine conflict such as embargoes regional instability geopolitical shift access to natural gas higher energy prices potential retaliatory action by the russian government including nationalization of foreign businesses increased tensions between the us and countries in which we operate and the extent of the conflict’s effect on the global economy cannot be predicted including the extent to which the conflict may heighten other risks disclosed herein ultimately these or other factors could result in further loss or writedowns of other operating assets and working capital 

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere’s equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

the demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment rising interest rates cautious consumer spending changes in consumer practices due to a possible recession lower corporate earnings and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions that cause john deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing john deere’s equipment the covid pandemic geopolitical instability including the conflict between russia and ukraine and other global events have significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty some of the results of these events include supply chain challenges inflation high interest rates foreign currency exchange volatility and volatility in global capital markets supply chain challenges including delays caused by shortages of raw materials shipping containers and labor have increased production costs and reduced our profit margins additionally the cost of raw materials used in john deere’s products and the cost of freight have increased due to heightened inflation these adverse economic events have and may continue to adversely affect john deere’s operations 

sustained negative economic conditions and outlook also affect housing starts energy prices and demand and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry segments are dependent on construction activity and have also been affected by recent adverse economic conditions in fiscal 2022 supply constraints shortage of turf inventory and softening customer demand have affected our production and sales of consumer products within these segments decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s results of operations 

if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deere’s agricultural equipment sales in addition uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive us fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook such as market volatility and continued interest rate increases by the federal reserve have caused and could continue to cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows additionally the company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets including the recent volatility of the united kingdom’s bond market which would negatively affect earnings 

changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bioenergy could affect the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements 

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies including those related to climate change and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect farm incomes which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses while higher commodity prices benefit john deere’s cropproducing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing bioenergy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices demand for john deere’s dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

john deere may not realize the anticipated benefits of its smart industrial operating model and leap ambitions 

john deere’s failure to realize the anticipated benefits of its smart industrial operating model and related business strategies in production systems precision technologies and aftermarket support could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition several factors could impact john deere’s ability to successfully execute the smart industrial operating model including among other things failure to accurately assess market opportunity and the technology required to address such 

opportunity failure to develop and introduce new technologies or lack of adoption of such technologies by john deere’s customers and failure to holistically execute lifecycle solutions in addition if the company is unable to optimize its capital allocation in connection with the operating model it may not be able to realize the full benefits which could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

similarly john deere may not realize the anticipated benefits of its leap ambitions and related goals in the expected timeline or at all as part of its leap ambitions framework john deere adopted various goals that it expects to achieve by 2026 or 2030 as applicable john deere may not be able to achieve these goals for a number of reasons some of which may be out of its control for example john deere’s estimates and assumptions related to efficiency of our products and the adoption of precision technology may not be accurate certain materials such as quality battery cells may become unavailable or too costly or infrastructure required to achieve our goals such as sufficient charging stations may become too costly or may not occur on the expected timeline the actual or perceived failure to achieve our leap ambitions could negatively impact our ability to execute the smart industrial operating model and could harm our reputation and our business 

john deere may not realize all anticipated benefits of acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

from time to time john deere makes strategic acquisitions and divestitures and participates in joint ventures in an effort to enhance its smart industrial operating model by adding technology and talent during fiscal year 2022 the company acquired majority ownership in kreisel electric inc which designs and manufactures highdurability battery packs and highpowered charging stations a 40 percent equity method investment in guss automation llc a producer of semiautonomous orchard and vineyard sprayers and lgt llc light which specializes in depth sensing and camerabased perception for autonomous vehicles 

acquisitions and joint ventures that john deere has entered or may enter in the future may involve significant challenges and risks including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance john deere’s business strategy or fail to produce satisfactory returns on investment john deere may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with its operations applying internal control processes to these acquisitions managing strategic investments and assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of john deere’s businesses integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore john deere may not realize all the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved these due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s or joint venture partner’s previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets or joint venture’s products or services 

john deere may decide to divest businesses if it determines any such divestiture is in the best interests of its shareholders and joint ventures may be terminated at or before their stated expiration such as the joint venture between the company and hitachi which the company agreed to voluntarily terminate in fiscal 2021 divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks including failure to advance our business strategy costs or disruptions to john deere and negative effects on john deere’s product offerings which may adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in the divested business through indemnifications or other financial arrangements such as retained liabilities which could affect the company’s future financial results 

john deere’s ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand could significantly affect its business results 

john deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in growth markets such as argentina brazil and india failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deere’s business 

customer preferences in the markets served by john deere could change as these markets transition to less carbonintensive business models ongoing social and regulatory focus on sustainability and the impact of policies and consumer preferences on the construction forestry and agriculture industries mean that change is imminent as regulations and social pressure drive change john deere must be proactive in monitoring trends and developing alternatives and enhancements that complement our product offerings for example the company may be unable to keep up with the rising demand for electric agriculture turf and construction equipment 

the development of alternative farming techniques carbon sequestration technologies and new lowcarbon biofuels could change farmers’ business models and equipment needs if john deere fails to properly develop or invest in new technologies to meet changing customer demands john deere will be at risk of losing potential sources of revenue which could affect the company’s future financial results 

the inability to accurately forecast customer demand for products and services and to adequately manage inventory could adversely affect our operating results 

to ensure adequate inventory supply john deere must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with suppliers and contract manufacturers these forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for particular products and services failure to accurately forecast our needs may result in unmet market demand parts shortages manufacturing delays increased costs or excess inventory in response to recent supply chain constraints john deere has worked with suppliers to ensure optimum inventory levels john deere’s ability to accurately forecast demand could be affected by many factors including changes in customer demand for john deere’s products and services changes in demand for the products and services of competitors unanticipated changes in general market conditions and the weakening of economic conditions or customer confidence in future economic conditions if the forecasts used to manage inventory are not accurate john deere has in the past and may in the future experience excess inventory levels shortage of available products or reduced manufacturing efficiencies 

if john deere is unable to deliver precision technology and agricultural solutions to its customers it could affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

john deere’s approach to precision technology involves hardware and software guidance connectivity and digital solutions automation and machine intelligence and autonomy to create and maintain a competitive differentiation through precision technology solutions john deere needs to successfully develop and introduce new precision technology solutions that improve profitability and sustainability for customers through the production systems john deere may make significant investments in research and development connectivity solutions data security for precision technology solutions and employee training these investments may not produce solutions that provide the desired results for customers’ profitability or sustainability outcomes if john deere is not able to deliver precision technology solutions with differentiated features and functionality customers may not adopt technology solutions which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation and business 

changes to or reallocation of radio frequency rf bands could disrupt or degrade the reliability of john deere’s high precision augmented global positioning system gps or other rf technology which could impair john deere’s ability to develop and market gps and rfbased technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability 

john deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment depend upon the use of rf signals these signals include but are not limited to gps signals other gpslike satellite signals augmented gps services and other rf technologies that link equipment operations owners dealers and technicians these radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national government agencies any international or national reallocation of frequency bands including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of john deere’s gpsbased products which could negatively affect john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions for john deere’s agricultural customers the inability to use highprecision augmented gps signals or other rf signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance seed fertilizer fuel and wage costs for construction customers disrupting gps or rf applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies these cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for john deere products 

john deere’s ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products in addition john deere’s industry is attracting nontraditional competitors including technologyfocused companies and startup ventures john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

john deere relies on a network of independent dealers to manage the distribution of its products if dealers are unsuccessful with their sales and business operations it could have an adverse effect on overall sales and revenue 

john deere relies on the capability of its dealers to develop and implement effective sales plans to create demand among purchasers for the equipment and related products and services that the dealers purchase from john deere if john deere’s dealers are not 

successful in these endeavors then john deere will be unable to grow its sales and revenue which would have an adverse effect on its financial condition in addition the dealer channel’s ability to support and service precision technology solutions and emerging power solutions may affect customers’ acceptance and adoption rates of these products 

dealers may have trouble funding their daytoday cash flow needs and paying their obligations due to adverse business conditions resulting from negative economic effects or other factors dealers may exit or john deere may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealers if they are unable to meet customer needs the unplanned loss of any john deere dealers could lead to inadequate market coverage negative customer impressions of john deere and may adversely impact john deere’s ability to collect receivables that are associated with that dealer 

environmental climate and weather risks 

unfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect john deere’s business 

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deere’s customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperature affects the rate of growth maturity and quality of crops temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms droughts diseases and pests either as a physical effect of climate change or otherwise have had and could in the future have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment and the financial condition and credit risk of john deere’s dealers and customers adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region particularly during the important spring selling season may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

governmental actions designed to address climate change and the emergence of new technologies and business models in connection with the transition to a lowercarbon economy could adversely affect john deere and its customers 

there is global scientific consensus that greenhouse gas ghg emissions continue to alter the composition of earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations have led to new international national regional and local legislative and regulatory responses various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are continuing to look for ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances required facilities improvements and increased energy costs which would increase john deere’s operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also affect customer operations and demand for john deere equipment john deere’s financial services is subject to additional international and national european regulations relating to climate and environmental risk which are continually evolving and could affect the lending operations and climaterisk processes developed by john deere’s financial services regulators in europe and the us have also focused efforts on increased disclosure related to climate change and mitigation efforts the sec has included in its regulatory agenda potential rulemaking on climate change disclosures that if adopted could significantly increase compliance burdens and associated regulatory costs and complexity 

increasingly stringent engine emission regulations or bans on internal combustion engines could impact john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

john deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world including the european union’s stage v standard which limits the amount of harmful substances in exhaust gases that offroad engines can emit into the environment in addition governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce offroad engine emissions these laws and regulations are applicable to engines manufactured by john deere including those used in john deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment john deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results additionally in certain locations governments have banned or may in the future ban internal combustion engines for some types of products completely to the extent these bans affect products manufactured and sold by john deere our business results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected 

financial risks 

sustained increases in funding obligations under the company’s pension plans may impair the company’s liquidity or financial condition 

the company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees which impose funding obligations the company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under these plans significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of return on pension investments being lower than expected the company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future these factors could significantly increase the company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deere’s customers and markets john deere’s operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could among other things have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on john deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development john deere’s operations including those outside of the united states may also be affected by nonus regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets 

changes in tax rates tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on john deere 

john deere is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions john deere’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change john deere’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretations if john deere’s effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount more than amounts previously accrued john deere’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency exchange and translation risk 

john deere operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies john deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which john deere earns revenues 

additionally the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of john deere’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies which are then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates in the company’s reported consolidated financial statements therefore fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currencies while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego any benefits that may result from favorable fluctuations in such rates 

because john deere’s equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit access to capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deere’s customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to john deere in response to increasing inflation the us federal reserve began to raise interest rates in march 2022 for the first time in over three years and has signaled it expects to make additional rate increases rising interest rates could cause credit market dislocations which could have an impact on funding costs which are important to the financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates while the company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of its financial assets and liabilities changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the company’s net interest income and earnings 

in addition actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

further due to the cessation of the london interbank offered rate “libor” the company has entered into financial transactions such as credit agreements receivables derivatives and notes that use the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” or the sterling overnight index average “sonia” as interest rate benchmarks sofr and sonia are calculated differently from libor and have inherent differences which could give rise to uncertainties including the limited historical data and volatility in the benchmark rates the full effects of the transition to sofr sonia or other rates remain uncertain 

because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact john deere’s operations and financial results 

negative economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide the financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations and may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the financial services segment’s inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s business the financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the financial services segment’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses the financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higherthanexpected equipment returns at lease maturity 

manufacturing and operational risks 

changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods have resulted and could continue to result in significant disruptions to the supply chain causing production disruptions increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products 

john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products t he price and availability of these materials have varied significantly in the last 24 months and are expected to continue to fluctuate due to inflation geopolitical and economic uncertainty and regulatory and policy instability including import tariffs and trade agreements the latter have the potential to significantly increase production and logistics costs and have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business particularly if john deere is unable to recover the increased costs due to market considerations or other factors john deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture its products significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials components and whole goods has and could continue to adversely affect john deere’s ability to meet commitments to customers during fiscal 2022 the supply chain challenges in combination with demand for john deere’s products resulted in a heavier backend loaded year for industry retail orders as the result of the covid pandemic geopolitical instability and other global events john deere has experienced changes in the availability and prices of these raw materials components whole goods and freight global logistics network challenges include shortages of shipping containers ocean freight capacity constraints international port delays trucking and chassis shortages and railway and airfreight capacity which have resulted in delays shortages of key manufacturing components increased order backlogs increased transportation costs and production inefficiencies from a higher number of partially completed machines in inventory which increased the company’s overall production and overhead costs increases in such costs have had an adverse effect on john deere’s business operations 

in an effort to mitigate raw material shortages and supply chain constraints john deere has increased the list price of its products and worked with suppliers to ensure optimum inventory levels however if customers are unwilling to accept price increases in john deere products or john deere is unable to offset the increase in costs raw material shortages could have an adverse effect on john deere’s operations continued or increased fluctuations in costs of materials or inflation generally and continued supply chain challenges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

certain materials and components used in john deere’s products are acquired from a single supplier or are proprietary in nature and cannot be alternatively sourced expeditiously as discussed under item 1 “business  construction and forestry” the company agreed to voluntarily terminate its joint venture agreement with hitachi in a transaction that closed in the first half of fiscal 2022 in connection with this termination john deere construction  forestry company a whollyowned subsidiary of the company has entered into a supply agreement with hitachi pursuant to which hitachi will continue to provide john deerebranded excavators components and service parts any delay or failure by hitachi to deliver these supplies or failure by hitachi to produce such supplies in a manner that meets john deere’s quality and quantity requirements could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations cash flow and financial condition or its ability to meet commitments to its customers 

disputes with labor unions have adversely affected john deere’s ability to operate its facilities as well as its financial results 

many of john deere’s production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with different expiration dates the failure of john deere to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire has from time to time led and could in the future lead to work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions disruptions to john deere’s manufacturing and partsdistribution facilities through various forms of labor disputes adversely affect the company on october 14 2021 the uaw initiated a labor strike affecting more than 10000 workers at 14 john deere facilities across the us the strike ended after a new collective bargaining agreement was approved on november 17 2021 the uaw strike had an adverse effect on john deere’s results of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 because of reduced production and shipments any strike work stoppage or other dispute with a labor union distracts management from operating the business may displace employees from ordinary job positions to fill in vacant positions may affect john deere’s reputation and could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

resources risks 

john deere’s ability to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees could affect its ability to execute its strategy 

john deere’s continued success depends in part on its ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education background and experience as well as its ability to develop engage and retain qualified employees failure to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants difficulty in recruiting new employees or inadequate resources to train integrate and retain qualified employees could impair john deere’s ability to execute its business strategy and could adversely affect john deere’s business in addition while john deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees john deere’s operations or ability to execute its business strategy and meet its business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees such as those john deere could experience if a surge occurs in the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect john deere through decreased employee morale the loss of knowledge of departing employees and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees 

security breaches and other disruptions to john deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with john deere’s operations and could compromise the information of john deere as well as its customers suppliers andor dealers exposing john deere to liability that could cause john deere’s business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business john deere relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of john deere equipment and from customers of the financial services segment john deere uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally john deere collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of john deere’s customers suppliers and dealers as well as personally identifiable information of john deere’s customers and employees in data centers which are often owned by third parties and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to john deere’s business operations and strategy despite security measures including a vulnerability disclosure program and business continuity plans john deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to intrusion damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals employee supplier or dealer error or malfeasance supply chain compromise disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses ransomware or other malware telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other events although john deere has not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in material business impact we have from time to time been the target of malicious cyber threat actors the occurrence of any significant event could compromise john deere’s networks and the information stored there could be accessed obtained publicly disclosed lost altered misused or stolen any such access disclosure alteration misuse or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings government investigations liability or regulatory penalties disruption to john deere’s operations and damage to john deere’s reputation which could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication john deere may need to invest additional resources to protect information security 

security breaches with respect to john deere’s products could interfere with the business of john deere its dealers andor customers exposing john deere to liability that would cause its business and reputation to suffer 

some of john deere’s products include connectivity hardware and software typically used for remote system updates while john deere has implemented security measures intended to protect against unauthorized remote access to its products third party security 

researchers and malicious threat actors have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to such products in order to gain control of the products change the products’ functionality user interface or performance characteristics interfere with the products’ operations or gain access to data stored in or generated by the products or to systems to which they connect in addition reports of unauthorized access to john deere’s products systems and data regardless of their veracity may result in the perception that the products systems or data are vulnerable to malicious or unauthorized modifications any unauthorized access to or control of john deere products or systems any loss of data or any perception that products systems or data are vulnerable could result in legal claims or proceedings against john deere government investigations liability or regulatory penalties which could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the potential loss of john deere intellectual property through trade secret theft infringement of patents trademark counterfeitings or other loss of rights to exclusive use of john deere intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the company infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by john deere could also have a material adverse effect on the company 

john deere relies on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect its intellectual property rights john deere heavily relies on certain trademarks that contribute to john deere’s identity and the recognition of its products and services including but not limited to the “john deere” mark the leaping deer logo the “nothing runs like a deere” slogan the prefix “jd” associated with many products and the green and yellow color combination these trademarks as well as the many patents used in our products are integral to the john deere business and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the company 

additionally third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of john deere’s patents or allege that john deere infringes their patents or proprietary rights john deere may incur substantial costs if its competitors or other third parties initiate such litigation or if john deere initiates any proceedings to protect its proprietary rights if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to john deere our business could be adversely affected 

legal and compliance risks 

john deere’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations the violation of which could expose john deere to potential liabilities increased costs and other adverse effects 

john deere’s global operations are subject to numerous international federal state and local laws and regulations many of which are complex frequently changing and subject to varying interpretations these laws and regulations cover a broad spectrum of subject areas including advertising anti–money laundering antitrust consumer finance environmental climaterelated health and safety foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions foreign ownership and investment importexport and trade human rights labor and employment product liability and telematics and data privacy and connectivity these laws may vary substantially within the different markets in which john deere operates compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and may further increase the cost of conducting john deere’s global operations in addition john deere must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and all applicable foreign anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that john deere’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or john deere’s policies and procedures violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have a material adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

changes to existing laws and regulations or changes to how they are interpreted or the implementation of new more stringent laws or regulations could adversely affect john deere’s business by increasing compliance costs limiting john deere’s ability to offer a product or service requiring changes to john deere’s business practices or otherwise making john deere’s products and services less attractive to customers for example socalled “right to repair” legislation proposals in certain states and at the federal level in the us could require john deere to provide access to the software code embedded in its products which among other harmful consequences could result in product safety issues compromise engine emissions and performance controls adversely affect the protection of john deere’s intellectual property rights and discourage innovation and investments in research and development legislative and regulatory changes and other actions that could potentially affect john deere’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and john deere may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse effects from such measures 

john deere is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection and any inability or perceived inability of john deere to address these requirements could adversely affect our business 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future john deere collects personal information and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union china canada and other relevant jurisdictions where john deere conducts business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions the european union general data protection regulation the california consumer privacy act and the china personal information protection law among others impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance new privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in the future any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newly acquired companies could result in additional cost and liability to the company or company officials damage our reputation inhibit sales and otherwise adversely affect our business 

legal proceedings and disputes in which john deere is and may in the future be involved could harm the company’s business financial condition reputation and brand 

john deere is subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks around the world john deere faces risks of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government inquires or investigations in the ordinary course of business the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved claims and lawsuits may harm john deere’s business financial condition reputation and brand the defense of lawsuits and government inquiries or investigations has resulted and may result in the expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations such legal proceedings may also affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments exceeding our reserves in addition to the ordinary course of business proceedings john deere is currently subject to a series of antitrust class action lawsuits alleging that it is unlawfully monopolizing the market for repair services for its agricultural equipment if these lawsuits result in adverse findings for john deere we could be exposed to damages and may be required to implement actions impacting our business model 

general risks 

john deere’s reputation and brand could be damaged by negative publicity 

john deere’s brand has worldwide recognition and significantly contributes to the success of its business john deere’s reputation is critical to growing its customer base john deere’s brand depends on the ability to maintain a positive customer perception of the business including the core values of integrity quality innovation and commitment negative claims or publicity involving john deere its products or services its culture and values customer data or any of its key employees or suppliers could damage john deere’s reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claims are accurate damage to john deere’s reputation could adversely impact the ability to attract new and maintain existing customers employees dealers and business relationships 

additionally negative or inaccurate postings articles or comments on social media and the internet about john deere could generate negative publicity that could damage the reputation of the brand or john deere 

further adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against john deere or by john deere could also damage the reputation and brand image undermine customer confidence and reduce longterm demand for equipment even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to john deere’s operations if the reputation culture or image of john deere’s brands are damaged or john deere receives negative publicity then the company’s sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

unexpected events have and may in the future increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war acts of terrorism epidemics and pandemics such as the covid pandemic civil unrest fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which john deere operates or in which john deere suppliers are located have and could in the future adversely affect the company’s operations and financial performance such events have and could cause complete or partial closure of one or more of john deere manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers and disruption and delay in the transport of products to dealers endusers and distribution centers existing insurance coverage may not provide protection from all the costs that may arise from such events 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deere’s facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions these potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for john deere’s products and the cost production sales and financial performance of john deere’s operations

products 

in fiscal year 2021 deere  company the company and its subsidiaries collectively john deere implemented a new operating model and reporting structure with this change john deere’s agriculture and turf operations were divided into two new segments production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf there were no reporting changes for the construction and forestry and financial services segments as a result john deere’s operations are now categorized into four major business segments 

the production and precision agriculture segment defines develops and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for productionscale growers of large grains small grains cotton and sugar the segment’s main products include large and certain midsize tractors combines cotton pickers sugarcane harvesters and loaders and soil preparation seeding application and crop care equipment 

the small agriculture and turf segment defines develops and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for dairy and livestock producers highvalue crop producers and turf and utility customers the segment’s primary products include certain midsize and small tractors as well as hay and forage equipment riding and commercial lawn equipment golf course equipment and utility vehicles 

the construction and forestry segment defines develops and delivers a broad range of machines and technology solutions organized along the earthmoving forestry and roadbuilding production systems the segment’s primary products include crawler dozers and loaders fourwheeldrive loaders excavators skidsteer loaders milling machines and log harvesters 

the products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets and as it relates to roadbuilding products in certain markets outside the us and canada primarily through companyowned sales and service subsidiaries 

the financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used production and precision agriculture small agriculture and turf and construction and forestry equipment in addition the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment finances retail revolving charge accounts and offers extended equipment warranties 

john deere’s worldwide production and precision agriculture operations small agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations are sometimes collectively referred to as the “equipment operations” the financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the “financial services operations” the production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf segments are sometimes collectively referred to as “agriculture and turf” or the “agriculture and turf operations” 

additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on pages 28 – 30 the john deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural equipment since 1837 the present company was incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1958

for fiscal 2021 worldwide net income attributable to the company was 5963 billion or 1899 per share compared with 2751 billion or 869 per share in fiscal 2020 worldwide net sales and revenues increased 24 percent to 44024 billion in 2021 compared with 35540 billion in 2020 net income in 2020 was negatively affected by impairment charges and employeeseparation costs of 458 million aftertax see notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements in addition net income in 2020 was unfavorably affected by discrete adjustments to the provision for income taxes net sales of the worldwide equipment operations increased in fiscal 2021 to 39737 billion compared with 31272 billion last year production and precision agriculture small agriculture and turf and construction and forestry sales increased during 2021 due to higher shipment volumes and price realization 

worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of 6868 billion in fiscal 2021 compared with 3559 billion in fiscal 2020 operating profit for production and precision agriculture increased due to price realization higher shipment volumes  sales mix and a favorable indirect tax ruling in brazil these items were partially offset by higher production costs the prior year was also impacted by voluntary employeeseparation program expenses operating profit for small agriculture and turf increased largely as a result of higher shipment volumessales mix and price realization partially offsetting these factors were higher production costs results for the current year were positively impacted by a gain on the sale of a factory in china while results for the prior year were affected by impairments closure costs and voluntary employeeseparation program expenses construction and forestry’s operating profit increased mainly due to higher shipment volumessales mix and price realization partially offset by higher production costs the prior year was also impacted by employeeseparation program expenses and impairments in certain fixed assets and unconsolidated affiliates 

net income of the company’s equipment operations was 5082 billion for fiscal 2021 compared with 2185 billion in fiscal 2020 the equipment operations’ provision for income taxes and net income in 2020 were adversely affected by nondeductible impairments and charges 

the financial services operations reported net income attributable to the company of 881 million for fiscal 2021 compared with 566 million in fiscal 2020 the increase was mainly due to improvement on operating lease residual values a lower provision for credit losses more favorable financing spreads and income earned on a higher average portfolio 

the cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2021 was 733 percent compared with 757 percent for 2020 the cost of sales to net sales ratio decreased compared to 2020 mainly due to price realization and the impact of impairments and employeeseparation expenses recorded in 2020 see note 5

agriculture and turf operations 

operating model  john deere’s production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf segments together offer a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts the segments are aligned around production systems enabling focus on delivering equipment technology and solutions across all the jobs customers execute during a season this holistic approach to production systems enables john deere to invest in the product roadmap and related research and development sales and marketing support for both the production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf segments continues to be organized around four geographic customer focus areas 

business environment  sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and government policies including global trade policies the amount and timing of government payments and policies related to climate change sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farmland prices farmers’ debt levels and access to financing interest and exchange rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels labor availability and costs energy costs tax policies and other input costs associated with farming other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers 

innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output these customers are increasingly adopting and integrating precision agricultural technologies like guidance telematics and data management in their operations the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the us and canada and a large proportion of sales in many countries outside the us and canada are comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters selfpropelled sprayers and seeding equipment however small tractors are an important part of our global tractor business further john deere offers a number of harvesting solutions to support development of the mechanized harvesting of grain oilseeds cotton sugar and biomass

risks related to the covid pandemic 

the covid pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect john deere’s business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

the virus causing covid was identified in late 2019 and spread globally covid pandemic efforts to combat the virus have been complicated by viral variants and uneven access to and acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines globally the pandemic resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and business closures these measures have impacted and may continue to impact all or portions of john deere’s workforce and operations and the operations of customers dealers and suppliers although certain restrictions related to the covid pandemic have eased uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures current material and component shortages have limited and could continue to limit john deere’s ability to meet customer demand which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

the covid pandemic caused a global recession and the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear the covid pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty has caused inflationary pressure in the us and elsewhere and has led to disruption and volatility in demand for john deere’s products and services suppliers’ ability to fill orders and global capital markets economic uncertainties could continue to affect demand for john deere’s products and services the value of the equipment financed or leased the demand for financing and the financial condition and credit risk of john deere’s dealers and customers

geopolitical uncertainties 

international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deere’s profitability and growth prospects 

international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of john deere’s products services and technology or those of our customers including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deere’s global business john deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and highquality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements negotiation of new trade agreements nontariff trade barriers local content requirements and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products including developments in uschina trade relations could limit john deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services these trade restrictions and changes in–or uncertainty surrounding–global trade policies may affect john deere’s competitive position furthermore market access and the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to john deere’s agricultural and forestry customers policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure additionally changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment as well as create unequal competition for multinational companies relative to domestic companies 

embargoes sanctions and export controls imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities including financial institutions to certain countries or regions or involving certain products limit the sales of john deere products embargoes sanctions and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies including with respect to china russia myanmar burma and belarus in particular changing us export controls and sanctions on china as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving china and chinese parties could affect john deere’s ability to collect receivables provide aftermarket and warranty support for john deere equipment and sell products and otherwise impact john deere’s reputation and business although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions violations of these laws or sanctions could harm john deere’s reputation and business and may subject john deere to civil and criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s results of operations and financial condition 

greater political economic and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deere’s competition customer base and product offerings and impact john deere’s growth opportunities globally 

john deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend in part upon access to additional geographic markets including but not limited to argentina brazil china india russia and south africa and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deere’s other markets negative market conditions resulting from economic and political uncertainties in these and other countries could reduce customer confidence resulting in declines in demand and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could affect writeoffs and provisions for credit losses operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and are often complex and difficult to navigate including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation sanctions and export control requirements repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the company’s financial results while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brands are less well known in some emerging markets which could impede john deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances john deere’s reputation andor business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful 

uncertain economic conditions 

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere’s equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

the demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment cautious consumer spending lower corporate earnings us budget issues and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions that cause john deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing john deere’s equipment as discussed under risks related to the covid pandemic– the covid pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect john deere’s business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows  the covid pandemic caused a global recession and significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts energy demand and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deere’s agricultural equipment sales in addition uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive us fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows additionally the company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings 

in addition demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations the risk that one or more other european union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the european union or the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of john deere’s eurodenominated assets and obligations have an adverse effect on demand for john deere’s products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in europe and globally more specifically it could affect the ability of john deere’s customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses and access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all as well as the availability of supplies and materials and the demand for john deere’s products 

financial risks 

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deere’s customers and markets failure of the us federal government to pass a 2022 budget resolution could lead to a us default under its sovereign debt the consequences of which could have significant and unpredictable effects on global financial markets which could in turn negatively affect john deere’s operating results cash flows and financial condition john deere’s operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on john deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development john deere’s operations including those outside of the united states may also be affected by nonus regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets 

changes in tax rates tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on john deere 

john deere is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions john deere’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change john deere’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretations if john deere’s effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of its taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued john deere’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency exchange and translation risk 

john deere operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies john deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which john deere earns revenues 

additionally the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of john deere’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currencies substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on john deere’s results 

because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact john deere’s operations and financial results 

negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide the financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations and may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the financial services segment’s inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s business the financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the financial services segment’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses the financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higherthanexpected equipment returns at lease maturity 

because john deere’s equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit access to capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deere’s customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to john deere in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to the financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates while the company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of its financial assets and liabilities changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the company’s net interest income and earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

the transition away from the london interbank offered rate “libor” and the adoption of alternative reference rates could adversely affect john deere’s business and results of operations 

john deere is exposed to liborbased financial instruments primarily relating to debt derivative and receivables transactions that have been entered into previously and remain outstanding the libor benchmark has been subject of national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of libor after 2021 in november 2020 the intercontinental exchange announced its intention to cease publication of certain libor settings by the end of 2021 while continuing to publish overnight and one three six and twelvemonth us dollar libor rates through june 30 2023 however in early 2021 the united states federal reserve board and other regulatory bodies issued guidance encouraging banks and other financial market participants to cease entering into new contracts that use us dollar libor as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event no later than december 31 2021 these actions may cause libor to perform differently than in the past and libor will likely ultimately cease to exist 

to facilitate an orderly transition from libor to alternative benchmark rates john deere has established an initiative led by internal subject matter experts to assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuation of libor as part of this initiative several alternative benchmark rates have been and continue to be evaluated at this time however the effects of the phase out of libor and the adoption of alternative benchmark rates have not been fully determined any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate 

libor exactly which could affect john deere’s contracts that mature after a libor cessation date in addition there is uncertainty about how applicable laws the courts or john deere will address the replacement of libor with alternative rates on variable rate contracts that do not include or contain unclear alternative rate fallback provisions a failure to properly transition away from libor could expose john deere to various financial operational and regulatory risks which could affect its results of operations and cash flows uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for the company’s securities 

sustained increases in funding obligations under the company’s pension plans may impair the company’s liquidity or financial condition 

the company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees which impose funding obligations the company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under these plans significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of return on pension investments being lower than expected the company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future these factors could significantly increase the company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

market conditions 

john deere’s ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

john deere’s ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand could significantly affect its business results 

john deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in growth markets such as argentina brazil and india failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deere’s business 

changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bioenergy could affect the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements 

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies including those related to climate change and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect farm incomes which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses while higher commodity prices benefit john deere’s cropproducing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing bioenergy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices demand for john deere’s dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

manufacturing and operations 

changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods could result in significant disruptions to the supply chain production disruptions and increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products 

john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products changes in the availability and prices of these raw materials components and whole goods which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility regulatory instability or change in import tariffs or trade agreements can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business particularly if john deere due to pricing considerations or other factors is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials components 

and whole goods can adversely affect john deere’s ability to meet commitments to customers john deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture its products 

certain components and parts used in john deere’s products are available from a single supplier and cannot be alternatively sourced quickly as discussed under item 1 “construction and forestry” the company agreed to voluntarily terminate its joint venture agreement with hitachi in a transaction that is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2022 in connection with this termination john deere construction  forestry company a whollyowned subsidiary of the company has entered into a supply agreement with hitachi pursuant to which hitachi will continue to provide john deerebranded excavators components and service parts any delay or failure by hitachi to deliver these supplies or failure by hitachi to produce such supplies in a manner that meets john deere’s quality and quantity requirements could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations cash flow and financial condition or its ability to meet commitments to its customers 

in 2020 the covid pandemic caused a significant reduction in global demand for goods resulting in widespread cuts in manufacturing capacity and the displacement of workers as economies around the world have reopened in 2021 sharp increases in demand have created significant disruptions to the global supply chain which have affected john deere’s ability to receive goods on a timely basis and at anticipated costs these supply chain disruptions have been caused and compounded by many factors including changes in supply and demand industry capacity constraints weather conditions natural disasters business continuity labor shortages the covid pandemic geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts global logistics network challenges include shortages of shipping containers ocean freight capacity constraints international port delays trucking and chassis shortages railway and air freight capacity and labor availability constraints which have resulted in delays shortages of key manufacturing components increased order backlogs and increased transportation costs john deere actively monitors and mitigates supply chain risk but there can be no assurance that our mitigation plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages of materials that we use in the production of our products uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of global supply chain disruptions have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect john deere’s business and outlook 

supply chain disruptions due to pandemic events including the covid pandemic supplier financial distress capacity constraints trade barriers labor shortages business continuity quality cyberattacks energy supply delivery issues or disruptions due to weatherrelated events or natural disasters could affect john deere’s operations and profitability 

data security and privacy risks 

security breaches and other disruptions to john deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with john deere’s operations and could compromise the information of john deere as well as its customers suppliers andor dealers exposing john deere to liability that could cause john deere’s business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business john deere relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of john deere equipment and from customers of the financial services segment john deere uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally john deere collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of john deere’s customers suppliers and dealers as well as personally identifiable information of john deere’s customers and employees in data centers which are often owned by third parties and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to john deere’s business operations and strategy despite security measures including a vulnerability disclosure program and business continuity plans john deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee supplier or dealer error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other catastrophic events although john deere has not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in material business impact we have from time to time been the target of malicious cyber threat actors the occurrence of any significant event could compromise john deere’s networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disruption to john deere’s operations and damage john deere’s reputation which could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication john deere may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of its systems 

john deere is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection and any inability or perceived inability of john deere to address these requirements could adversely affect our business 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future john deere collects personal information and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union china canada and other relevant jurisdictions where john deere conducts business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions the european union general data protection regulation the california consumer privacy act and the china personal information protection law among others impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance new privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in the future any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newly acquired companies could result in additional cost and liability to the company or company officials damage our reputation inhibit sales and otherwise adversely affect our business  

security breaches with respect to john deere’s products could interfere with the business of john deere its dealers andor customers exposing john deere to liability that would cause its business and reputation to suffer 

some of john deere’s products include connectivity hardware typically used for remote system updates while john deere has implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to its products malicious actors have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to such products through such connectivity hardware in order to gain control of the products change the products’ functionality user interface or performance characteristics or gain access to data stored in or generated by the products any unauthorized access to or control of john deere products or systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims against john deere or government investigations in addition reports of unauthorized access to john deere’s products systems and data regardless of their veracity may result in the perception that the products systems or data are capable of being hacked which could harm john deere’s brand prospects and operating results john deere has been the subject of such reports in the past 

intellectual property risks 

the potential loss of john deere intellectual property through trade secret theft infringement of patents trademark counterfeiting or other loss of rights to exclusive use of john deere intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the company infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by john deere could also have a material adverse effect on the company 

john deere relies on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect its intellectual property rights in particular john deere heavily relies on certain trademarks that contribute to john deere’s identity and the recognition of its products and services including but not limited to the “john deere” mark the leaping deer logo the “nothing runs like a deere” slogan the prefix “jd” associated with many products and the green and yellow equipment colors these trademarks as well as the many patents used in our products are integral to the john deere business and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the company 

additionally third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of john deere’s patents or allege that john deere infringes their patents john deere may incur substantial costs if its competitors or other third parties initiate such litigation or if john deere initiates any proceedings to protect its proprietary rights if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to john deere our business could be adversely affected similarly disputes may arise regarding whether john deere’s products or technologies infringe the proprietary rights of others any such infringement could cause third parties including our competitors to bring claims against john deere resulting in significant costs possible damages and substantial uncertainty 

human capital risks 

john deere’s ability to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees could affect its ability to execute its strategy 

john deere’s continued success depends in part on its ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education background and experience as well as its ability to develop engage and retain qualified employees failure to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants difficulty in recruiting new employees or inadequate resources to train integrate and retain qualified employees could impair john deere’s ability to execute its business strategy and could adversely affect john deere’s business in addition while john deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees john deere’s operations or ability to execute its business strategy and meet its business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees such as those john deere could experience if a surge occurs in the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs similar to that experienced by 

other employers and industries since 2020 higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect john deere through decreased employee morale the loss of knowledge of departing employees and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees 

disputes with labor unions have adversely affected john deere’s ability to operate its facilities as well as its financial results 

many of john deere’s production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with different expiration dates the failure of john deere to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire has from time to time led and could in the future lead to work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions disruptions to john deere’s manufacturing and partsdistribution facilities through various forms of labor disputes adversely affect the company on october 14 2021 after employees represented by the uaw failed to approve a new collective bargaining agreement between john deere and the uaw the uaw initiated a labor strike affecting more than 10000 workers at 14 john deere facilities across the us which adversely affected john deere’s operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the strike ended after a new collective bargaining agreement was approved on november 17 2021 the uaw strike is expected to have an adverse effect on john deere’s results of operations for the three months ending january 30 2022 as a result of reduced production and shipments any strike work stoppage or other dispute with a labor union distracts management from operating the business may displace employees from ordinary job positions to fill in vacant positions may affect john deere’s reputation and could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

environmental climate and weather risks 

unfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect john deere’s business 

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deere’s customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth maturity and quality of crops natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms droughts diseases and pests can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment and the financial condition and credit risk of john deere’s dealers and customers adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region particularly during the important spring selling season may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions apply to john deere’s operations suppliers and customers and enforcement actions or civil litigation related to those requirements could adversely affect john deere’s business results 

enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigations and legal costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities including with respect to disclosure relating to climate change risks could prevent or restrict john deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability further civil litigation on these subjects continues to increase primarily in the us there can be no assurance that violations of such laws andor regulations civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers or other civil claims in which john deere becomes a party would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deere’s business results of operations or financial condition 

increasingly stringent engine emission regulations or bans on internal combustion engines could impact john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

john deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world including the european union’s stage v standard in addition governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce offroad engine emissions these laws and regulations are applicable to engines manufactured by john deere including those used in john deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment john deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or 

engines which could negatively impact business results additionally in certain locations governments have banned or may in the future ban internal combustion engines for some types of products completely to the extent these bans affect products manufactured and sold by john deere our business results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected 

governmental actions designed to address climate change and the emergence of new technologies and business models in connection with the transition to a lowercarbon economy could adversely affect john deere and its customers the physical effects attributed to climate change could further impact john deere’s facilities suppliers and customers 

there is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg continue to alter the composition of earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations may lead to new international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are continuing to look for ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deere’s operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also affect customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future climate changerelated legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards john deere is unable to predict their potential impact at this time 

customer preferences in the markets served by john deere could change as these markets transition to less carbonintensive business models demand for electric agricultural turf and construction equipment could rise the development of alternative farming techniques carbon sequestration technologies and new lowcarbon biofuels could change farmers’ business models and equipment needs if john deere fails to properly develop or invest in new technologies to meet changing customer demands john deere will be at risk of losing potential sources of revenue which could affect the company’s future financial results 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deere’s facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions these may include extreme weather events and longterm changes in temperature levels and water availability these potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for john deere’s products and the cost production sales and financial performance of john deere’s operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

john deere’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations the violation of which could expose john deere to potential liabilities increased costs and other adverse effects 

john deere’s global operations are subject to numerous international federal state and local laws and regulations many of which are complex frequently changing and subject to varying interpretations these laws and regulations cover a broad spectrum of subject areas including advertising anti–money laundering antitrust consumer finance environmental health and safety including proper handling of electronic waste recycling and climate change foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions foreign ownership and investment importexport and trade human rights labor and employment product liability and telematics and data privacy and connectivity these laws may vary substantially within the different markets in which john deere operates compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and may further increase the cost of conducting john deere’s global operations in addition john deere must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and all applicable foreign anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that john deere’s employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or john deere’s policies and procedures violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have a materially adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

changes to existing laws and regulations or changes to how they are interpreted or the implementation of new more stringent laws or regulations could adversely affect john deere’s business by increasing compliance costs limiting john deere’s ability to offer a product or service requiring changes to john deere’s business practices or otherwise making john deere’s products and services less attractive to customers for example socalled “right to repair” legislation proposals in certain states and at the federal level in the us could require john deere to provide access to the software code embedded in its products which among other harmful consequences could result in product safety issues compromise engine emissions and performance controls adversely affect the protection of john deere’s intellectual property rights and discourage innovation and investments in research and development 

legislative and regulatory changes and other actions that could potentially affect john deere’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and john deere may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse effects from such measures 

strategic performance risks 

john deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of its business strategies including acquisitions joint ventures and divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

from time to time john deere makes strategic acquisitions and divestitures and participates in joint ventures acquisitions and joint ventures that john deere has entered into or may enter into in the future may involve significant challenges and risks including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance john deere’s business strategy or fail to produce satisfactory returns on investment john deere may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with its operations applying internal control processes to these acquisitions managing strategic investments and assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of john deere’s businesses integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore john deere may not realize all the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved these due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s or joint venture partner’s previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets or joint venture’s products or services john deere may decide to divest acquired businesses if we determine any such divestiture is in the best interests of our shareholders and our joint ventures may be terminated at or before their stated terms divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks including failure to advance our business strategy costs or disruptions to john deere and negative effects on john deere’s product offerings which may adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in the divested business through indemnifications or other financial arrangements such as retained liabilities which could affect the company’s future financial results 

in addition john deere may not realize all anticipated benefits of its recent reorganization and the implementation of its operating model within the anticipated timeframe or at all factors that could affect these benefits include the adoption of new job types within john deere changing job responsibilities of employees the number of layers of management the ability of employees to embrace change anxiety within the workforce and temporary inefficiencies further the ability of john deere to execute its business strategies in production systems precision technologies and aftermarket support could affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

precision technology risks 

if john deere is unable to deliver precision technology and agricultural solutions to its customers it could affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

john deere’s approach to precision technology involves hardware and software guidance connectivity and digital solutions automation and machine intelligence and autonomy to create and maintain a competitive differentiation through precision technology solutions john deere needs to successfully develop and introduce new precision technology solutions that improve profitability and sustainability for customers through the production systems john deere may make significant investments in research and development acquisitions or other business ventures data security for precision technology solutions and employee training these investments may not produce solutions that provide the desired results for customers’ profitability or sustainability outcomes in addition john deere may depend on third parties to supply components software and services in support of precision technology solutions the dealer channel’s ability to support and service precision technology solutions may affect customers’ acceptance and adoption rates of these products further if john deere is not able to deliver precision technology solutions with differentiated features and functionality customers may not adopt technology solutions which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation and business 

the reallocation of radio frequency rf bands could disrupt or degrade the reliability of john deere’s high precision augmented global positioning system gps or other rf technology which could impair john deere’s ability to develop and market gps and rfbased technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability 

john deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment depend upon the use of rf signals these signals include but are not limited to gps signals other gpslike satellite signals augmented gps services and other rf technologies that link equipment operations owners dealers and technicians these radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national government agencies any international or national reallocation of frequency bands including frequency bands segmentation 

and band spectrum sharing or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of john deere’s gpsbased products which could negatively affect john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions for john deere’s agricultural customers the inability to use highprecision augmented gps signals or other rf signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance seed fertilizer fuel and wage costs for construction customers disrupting gps or rf applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies these cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for john deere products

risk factors

tableend the following risks are considered material to john deere’s business based upon current knowledge information and assumptions this discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis beginning on page 24 including the risks and uncertainties described in the safe harbor statement on pages 27 – 29 and the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 44 these risk factors and other forwardlooking statements that relate to future events expectations trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business while others could affect all of the company’s businesses although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated the company except as required by law undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion whether as a result of new developments or otherwise the risks described in this annual report on form 10k and the “safe harbor statement” in this report are not the only risks faced by the company 

risks related to the covid pandemic 

the covid pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect john deere’s business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

covid was identified in late 2019 and has spread globally the pandemic has resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and business closures these measures have impacted and may further impact all or portions of the company’s workforce and operations and the operations of customers and suppliers countries around the world have been affected by the pandemic and have taken containment actions considerable uncertainty exists regarding such measures and potential future measures restrictions on access to the company’s manufacturing facilities or on the support operations or workforce or similar limitations for suppliers and dealers restrictions or disruptions of transportation port closures increased border controls or closures and material and component shortages have limited and could continue to limit the company’s ability to meet customer demand which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations there is no certainty that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and the company’s ability to perform critical functions could be harmed 

the covid pandemic caused a global recession and there is no certainty about when a sustained economic recovery may occur the covid pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has led to disruption and volatility in demand for the company’s products and services suppliers’ ability to fill orders and global capital markets economic uncertainties could continue to affect demand for the company’s products and services the value of the equipment financed or leased the demand for financing and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers 

uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of the covid pandemic may significantly adversely affect our business and outlook these uncertainties include the duration and impact of the resurgence in covid cases in any country state or region prolonged reduction or closure of the company’s operations or a delayed recovery in our operations additional closures as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities disruptions in the supply chain and a prolonged delay in resumption of operations by one or more key suppliers or the failure of any key suppliers the company’s ability to meet commitments to our customers on a timely basis as a result of increased costs and supply challenges the ability to receive goods on a timely basis and at anticipated costs increased logistics costs delays in the company’s strategic initiatives as a result of reduced spending on research and development additional operating costs due to remote working arrangements adherence to social distancing guidelines and other covidrelated challenges increased risk of cyber attacks on network connections used in remote working arrangements increased privacyrelated risks due to processing healthrelated personal information legal claims related to personal protective equipment designed made or provided by the company or alleged exposure to covid on company premises absence of employees due to illness the impact of the pandemic on the company’s customers and dealers and their delays in their plans to invest in new equipment requests by the company’s customers or dealers for payment deferrals and contract modifications the impact of disruptions in the global capital markets andor declines in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings which could impact the company’s ability to obtain funding in the future and the impact of the pandemic on demand for our products and services as discussed above it is unclear when a sustained economic recovery could occur and what a recovery may look like all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business liquidity results of operations and financial position 

the ultimate magnitude of covid effects including the extent of its impact on the company’s financial and operational results which could be material will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues its effect on the demand for the company’s products and services and the supply chain as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic we cannot at this time predict the impact of the covid pandemic but it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

geopolitical uncertainties 

international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deere’s profitability and growth prospects 

international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of john deere’s products services and technology or those of our customers including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deere’s multinational business and subject john deere to civil and criminal sanctions for violations john deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements negotiation of new trade agreements and imposition of new and retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products including developments in uschina trade relations could limit john deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services these trade restrictions and changes in–or uncertainty surrounding–global trade policies may affect john deere’s competitive position furthermore market access and the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to john deere’s agricultural and forestry customers policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure additionally changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment 

furthermore embargoes sanctions and export controls imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities including financial institutions to certain countries or regions or involving certain products limit the sales of deere products and expose john deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions embargoes sanctions and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies including with respect to russia china venezuela and nicaragua in particular changing us export controls and sanctions on china as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving china and chinese parties could affect john deere’s ability to collect receivables provide aftermarket and warranty support for john deere equipment sell products and otherwise impact deere’s reputation and business although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions violations of these laws or sanctions could harm john deere’s reputation and business and may subject john deere to civil and criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s results of operations and financial condition 

greater political economic and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deere’s competition customer base and product offerings and impact john deere’s growth opportunities globally 

john deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to additional geographic markets including but not limited to argentina brazil china india and russia and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deere’s other markets negative market conditions resulting from economic and political uncertainties in these and other countries could reduce customer confidence resulting in declines in demand and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could affect writeoffs and provisions for credit losses operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation sanctions and export control requirements repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the company’s financial results while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brands are less well known in some emerging markets which could impede john deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances john deere’s reputation andor business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful 

uncertain economic conditions 

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere’s equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

the demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment cautious consumer spending lower corporate earnings us budget issues and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions causing john deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing john deere’s equipment as discussed under risks related to the covid pandemic– the covid pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect john deere’s business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows  the covid pandemic caused a global recession and significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts energy demand and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deere’s agricultural equipment sales in addition uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive us fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows additionally the company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings 

in addition demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations uncertainty following the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union the risk that one or more other european union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the european union or the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the company’s eurodenominated assets and obligations have an adverse effect on demand for john deere’s products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in europe and globally more specifically it could affect the ability of john deere’s customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all and the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for john deere’s products 

financial risks 

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deere’s customers and markets john deere’s operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on john deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development john deere’s operations including those outside of the united states may also be affected by nonus regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets 

changes in tax rates tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on john deere 

john deere is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions the company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change john deere’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued john deere’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency exchange and translation risk 

john deere operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies john deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which john deere earns revenues 

additionally the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of john deere’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on john deere’s results 

because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact john deere’s operations and financial results 

negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide the financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations the financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the financial services segment’s inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s business the financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the financial services segment’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses the financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected equipment returns at lease maturity 

because john deere’s equipment operations and financial services segments are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit access to capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deere’s customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to john deere in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to john deere’s financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates while the company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the company’s net interest income and earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

changes affecting the availability of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may have consequences for john deere that may not yet be reasonably predicted 

the company has outstanding debt derivative and receivable transactions with variable interest rates based on libor the libor benchmark has been subject of national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of libor after 2021 these reforms may cause libor to perform differently than in the past and libor may ultimately cease to exist after 2021 alternative benchmark rates may replace libor and could affect the companys debt securities derivative instruments receivables debt payments and receipts at this time the effects of any phase out of libor or any adoption of alternative benchmark rates are still unclear any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate libor exactly which could impact our contracts that terminate after 2021 there is uncertainty about how applicable law the courts or the company will address the replacement of libor with alternative rates on variable rate retail loan contracts and other contracts that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions in addition any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets which could impact our results of operations and cash flows uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities 

sustained increases in funding obligations under the company’s pension plans may impair the company’s liquidity or financial condition 

the company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees which impose funding obligations the company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected the company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future these factors could significantly increase the company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

market conditions 

john deere’s ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition 

john deere’s ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand could significantly affect its business results 

john deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in argentina brazil and india failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deere’s business 

changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bioenergy could affect the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements 

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment while higher commodity prices benefit john deere’s cropproducing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing bioenergy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices demand for john deere’s dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

manufacturing and operations 

changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods could result in significant disruptions to the supply chain production disruptions and increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products 

john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products changes in the availability and price of these raw materials components and whole goods which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility regulatory instability or change in import tariffs or trade agreements can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business particularly if john deere due to pricing considerations or other factors is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials components and whole goods can adversely affect john deere’s ability to meet commitments to customers for example during fiscal 2020 some of the company’s operations were temporarily impacted by certain material or component shortages due to covid john deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture its products certain components and parts used in john deere’s products are available from a single supplier and cannot be alternatively sourced quickly supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress capacity constraints trade barriers labor shortages business continuity quality cyber attacks delivery issues or disruptions due to weatherrelated natural disaster or pandemic events could affect john deere’s operations and profitability 

data security and privacy 

security breaches and other disruptions to john deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with john deere’s operations and could compromise john deere’s and its customers’ and suppliers’ information exposing john deere to liability that would cause john deere’s business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business john deere relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of john deere equipment and from customers of john deere’s financial services operations john deere uses information technology 

systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally john deere collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of john deere’s customers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of john deere’s customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to john deere’s business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans john deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee or supplier error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise john deere’s networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage john deere’s reputation which could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems 

john deere is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection and any inability or perceived inability of the company to address these requirements could adversely affect our business 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future john deere collects personal information and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union canada and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance new privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in 2021 any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newly acquired companies could result in additional cost and liability to us or company officials damage our reputation inhibit sales and otherwise adversely affect our business  

intellectual property risks 

the potential loss of john deere intellectual property through trade secret theft infringement of patents trademark counterfeiting or other loss of rights to exclusive use of john deere intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the company infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by deere could also have a material adverse effect on the company 

john deere relies on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights in particular we heavily rely on certain john deere trademarks which contribute to john deere’s identity and the recognition of its products and services including but not limited to the “john deere” mark the leaping deer logo the “nothing runs like a deere” slogan the prefix “jd” associated with many products and the green and yellow equipment colors these trademarks as well as the many patents used in our products are integral to the john deere business and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the company 

additionally third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or allege that we infringe their patents we may incur substantial costs if our competitors or other third parties initiate such litigation or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us our business could be adversely affected similarly disputes may arise regarding whether our products or technologies infringe the proprietary rights of others any such infringement could cause third parties including our competitors to bring claims against us resulting in significant costs possible damages and substantial uncertainty 

human capital risks 

john deere’s ability to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees could impact its ability to execute its strategy 

john deere’s continued success depends in part on its ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education background and experience further john deere’s success depends in part on its ability to develop engage and retain qualified employees failure to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants difficulty in recruiting new employees or inadequate resources to train integrate and retain qualified employees 

could impair john deere’s ability to execute its business strategy and could adversely affect john deere’s business in addition while john deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees john deere’s operations or ability to execute its business strategy may be impacted by the loss of employees particularly when departures involve groups of employees such as the voluntary and involuntary separation programs in fiscal 2020 employeeseparation programs may adversely affect the company through decreased employee morale the loss of knowledge of departing employees and the devotion of resources to reorganizing and reassigning job roles and responsibilities the company’s ability to meet its business objectives may be affected by the departure of employees and the expected cost savings of the employeeseparation programs may not be achieved due to delays or other factors further the departure of groups of employees could increase the risk to the company of claims or litigation from former employees 

disputes with labor unions could adversely affect john deere’s ability to operate its facilities as well as its financial results 

many of john deere’s production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with different expiration dates disruptions to john deere’s manufacturing and partsdistribution facilities through various forms of labor disputes could adversely affect the company in 2021 john deere will be renegotiating several labor agreements any strike work stoppage or other dispute with a labor union could materially adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

environmental climate and weather risks 

unfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect john deere’s business 

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deere’s customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth crop maturity and crop quality natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms droughts diseases and pests can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment sales of turf equipment particularly during the important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various international regulatory authorities apply to john deere’s operations suppliers and customers and enforcement actions or civil litigation related to those requirements could adversely affect john deere’s business results 

enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and legal costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict john deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability further civil litigation on these subjects continues to increase primarily in the us there can be no assurance that violations of such laws andor regulations civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers or other civil claims in which john deere becomes a party would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deere’s business financial condition or results of operations 

increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

john deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world including the european union’s stage v standard in addition governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce offroad engine emissions these laws and regulations are applicable to engines manufactured by john deere including those used in john deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment john deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results 

new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change could increase costs to john deere and the physical effects attributed to climate change could further impact its facilities suppliers and customers 

there is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg continue to alter the composition of earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations may lead to new international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are continuing to look for ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deere’s operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future ghg legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards john deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time 

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deere’s facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include extreme weather events and longterm changes in temperature levels and water availability these potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for john deere’s products and the cost production sales and financial performance of john deere’s operations 

bribery and corruption risks 

john deere is subject to extensive anticorruption laws and regulations the violation of which could adversely affect john deere 

john deere’s global operations must comply with all applicable anticorruption laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act these anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

strategic performance risks 

john deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our business strategies including acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

from time to time the company makes strategic acquisitions and divestitures or participates in joint ventures acquisitions or joint ventures that the company has entered into or may enter into in the future may involve significant challenges and risks including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance our business strategy or fail to produce satisfactory returns on our investment the company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with its operations in applying internal control processes to these acquisitions in managing strategic investments and in assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of the company’s business integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore john deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s or joint venture partner’s previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets or joint venture’s products or services we may decide to divest ourselves of acquired businesses if we determine any such divestiture is in the best interests of our shareholders and our joint ventures may be terminated at or before their stated terms divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks including failure to advance our business strategy costs or disruptions to the company or negative effects on the company’s product offerings which may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition these divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in the divested business through indemnifications or other financial arrangements such as retained liabilities which could affect the company’s future financial results 

in addition the company may not realize all anticipated benefits of its reorganization and implementation of its operating model in the anticipated timeframe or at all the factors that could affect these benefits include the adoption of new job types within the company changing job responsibilities of employees the number of layers of management ability of employees to embrace change anxiety 

within the workforce and temporary inefficiencies further the ability of the company to execute its business strategies in production systems precision technologies and aftermarket support could affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

precision technology risks 

if john deere is unable to deliver precision technology and agricultural solutions to its customers it could affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

john deere’s approach to precision technology involves hardware and software guidance connectivity and digital solutions automation and machine intelligence and autonomy to create and maintain a competitive differentiation through precision technology solutions the company needs to successfully develop and introduce new precision technology solutions that improve profitability and sustainability for customers through the production systems john deere may make significant investments in research and development acquisitions or other business ventures data security for precision technology solutions and employee training these investments may not produce solutions that provide the desired result for customers’ profitability or sustainability outcomes in addition the company may depend on third parties to supply components software and services in the precision technology solutions the dealer channel’s ability to support and service precision technology solutions may affect customers’ acceptance and adoption rates of these products further if john deere is not able to deliver the precision technology solutions with differentiated features and functionality customers may not adopt technology solutions which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s reputation and business 

the reallocation of radio frequency rf spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of john deere’s high precision augmented global positioning system gps or other rf technology which could impair john deere’s ability to develop and market gps and rfbased technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability 

john deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment depend upon the use of rf signals these signals include but are not limited to gps signals other gpslike satellite signals augmented gps services and other rf equipment which link equipment operations owners dealers and technicians these radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national government agencies any international or national reallocation of frequency bands including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of john deere’s gpsbased products which could negatively affect john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions for john deere’s agricultural customers the inability to use highprecision augmented gps signals or other rf signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance seed fertilizer fuel and wage costs for construction customers disrupting gps or rf applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies these cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for john deere products

market conditions and outlook 

net income attributable to deere  company for fiscal 2020 is forecast to be in a range of 27 billion to 31 billion 

agriculture  turf the company’s worldwide sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to be down about 5 to 10 percent for fiscalyear 2020 including price realization of 2 percent and a negative currencytranslation effect of 1 percent industry sales of agricultural equipment in the us and canada are forecast to be down about 5 percent driven by lower demand for large equipment fullyear industry sales in the european union eu28 member nations are forecast to be about the same as are south american industry sales of tractors and combines asian sales are forecast to be about the same as 2019 industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the us and canada are expected to be about the same for 2020 

construction  forestry the company’s worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are anticipated to be down about 10 to 15 percent for 2020 with price realization having a favorable effect of 1 percent and foreigncurrency translation having an unfavorable effect of 1 percent the outlook reflects slowing construction activity as well as the company’s efforts to assist dealers to manage their inventory levels in forestry global industry sales are expected to be about the same as 2019 

financial services fiscalyear 2020 net income attributable to the company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately 600 million net income is expected to benefit from lower losses on lease residual values as well as income earned on a higher average portfolio these items are forecast to be partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses lessfavorable financing spreads and higher selling and administrative expenses 

2019 consolidated results compared with 2018 

for fiscal 2019 worldwide net income attributable to the company was 3253 billion or 1015 per share compared with 2368 billion or 724 per share in 2018 worldwide net sales and revenues increased 5 percent to 39258 billion in 2019 compared with 37358 billion in 2018 net sales of worldwide equipment operations increased in fiscal 2019 to 34886 billion compared with 33351 billion last year wirtgen results are included for the full year while 2018 contained ten months of wirtgen activity the two additional months added about 1 percent to the company’s 2019 net sales agriculture  turf sales increased for 2019 due to price realization and higher shipment volumes partially offset by the unfavorable effects of currency translation construction  forestry sales were higher for 2019 primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization partially offset by the unfavorable effects of currency translation the inclusion of wirtgen’s sales for two additional months in 2019 accounted for about 4 percent of construction  forestry’s net sales increase 

worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of 3721 billion in fiscal 2019 compared with 3684 billion in fiscal 2018 operating profit for agricultural  turf decreased for 2019 largely due to higher productions costs the unfavorable effects of currency exchange increased research and development costs higher selling administrative and general expenses and a lessfavorable sales mix partially offset by price realization and higher shipment volumes wirtgen’s operating profit was 343 million for 2019 compared with 116 million for 2018 excluding wirtgen construction  forestry’s operating profit was higher in 2019 primarily driven by price realization and higher shipment volumes partially offset by higher production costs and a lessfavorable sales mix 

net income of the company’s equipment operations was 2698 billion for fiscal 2019 compared with 1404 billion in fiscal 2018 net income was favorably affected by discrete adjustments to the provision for income taxes of 65 million related to us tax reform legislation tax reform while adjustments related to tax reform had an unfavorable impact of 1045 billion for fiscal 2018 

the financial services operations reported net income attributable to the company of 539 million for fiscal 2019 compared with 942 million in fiscal 2018 excluding taxreform adjustments the decrease was mainly due to impairments and higher losses on operatinglease residual values and unfavorable financing spreads partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio 

the cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2019 was 768 percent compared with 767 percent for 2018 the cost of sales to net sales ratio increased compared to 2018 mainly due to higher production costs the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange and a less favorable product mix partially offset by price realization

the john deere agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts the segment consolidates all markets into four geographical customer focus areas to facilitate deep customer understanding and deliver worldclass customer service the segment’s operations are consolidated into five product platforms — crop harvesting combines cotton pickers cotton strippers and sugarcane harvesters related harvesting frontend equipment sugarcane loaders and pullbehind scrapers turf and utility utility vehicles riding lawn equipment walkbehind mowers commercial mowing equipment golf course equipment implements for mowing tilling snow and debris handling aerating and many other residential commercial golf and sports turf care applications and other outdoor power products hay and forage selfpropelled forage harvesters and attachments balers and mowers crop care tillage seeding and application equipment including sprayers nutrient management and soil preparation machinery and tractors loaders and large medium and utility tractors and related attachments john deere also purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale 

the segment also provides integrated precision agriculture technologies across its portfolio of large equipment john deere has developed a leading approach to precision agriculture technology through advanced communications and telematics on board sensors and computers and precise global navigation satellite systems technology to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields improve soil conservation minimize chemical use and to gather information john deere’s advanced telematics systems remotely 

connect agricultural equipment owners business managers and dealers to agricultural equipment in the field providing realtime alerts and information about equipment location utilization performance and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency 

in addition to the john deere brand the agriculture and turf segment purchases and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the frontier kemper and green systems brand names the segment also manufactures and sells sprayers under the hagie and mazzotti brand names planters and cultivators under the monosem brand name sprayers and planters under the pla brand name carbon fiber sprayer booms under the king agro brand name and walkbehind mowers and scarifiers in select european countries under the sabo brand name john deere manufactures its agriculture and turf equipment for sale primarily through independent retail dealer networks and also builds turf products for sale by mass retailers including the home depot and lowe’s 

sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and government policies including global trade policies and the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels and access to financing interest and exchange rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels labor availability and costs energy costs tax policies and other input costs associated with farming other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers 

innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the us and canada and a significant proportion of sales in many countries outside the us and canada are comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters selfpropelled sprayers and seeding equipment however small tractors are an increasingly important part of our global tractor business further john deere offers a number of harvesting solutions to support development of the mechanized harvesting of grain oilseeds cotton sugar and biomass 

retail sales of lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors residential and commercial mowers utility vehicles and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions 

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment john deere offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural equipment the segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during offseason periods in australia canada and the us there are typically several used equipment tradein transactions as part of most new agricultural equipment sales to provide support to its dealers for these used equipment tradeins john deere provides dealers in these countries with pools of funds awarded to dealers as a percentage of the dealer cost for eligible new equipment sales dealers can use these funds to defray the costs of carrying or marketing used equipment inventory or to provide financing incentives to customers purchasing the used equipment 

retail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third fiscal quarters john deere has pursued a strategy of building and shipping such equipment as close to retail demand as possible consequently to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year production and shipment schedules of these product lines are normally proportionately higher in the second and third fiscal quarters of each year corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales

risk factors

tableend the following risks are considered the most significant to john deere’s business based upon current knowledge information and assumptions this discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis beginning on page 22 including the risks and uncertainties described in the safe harbor statement on pages 24 – 26 and the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 38 these risk factors and other forwardlooking statements that relate to future events expectations trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of 

business while others could affect all of the company’s businesses although each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated the company except as required by law undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion whether as a result of new developments or otherwise the risks described in this annual report on form 10k and the “safe harbor statement” in this report are not the only risks faced by the company 

international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deere’s profitability and growth prospects 

international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of john deere’s products services and technology including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deere’s multinational business and subject john deere to civil and criminal sanctions for violations john deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements the failure to ratify the united statesmexicocanada agreement negotiation of new trade agreements and imposition of new and retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products including developments in uschina trade relations could limit john deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services these trade restrictions and changes in–or uncertainty surrounding–global trade policies may affect john deere’s competitive position furthermore the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to john deere’s agricultural and forestry customers policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure additionally changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment furthermore sanctions and export controls imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons including financial institutions to certain countries or involving certain products expose john deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies including with respect to russia venezuela nicaragua and turkey although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions violations of these laws or sanctions could have an adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deere’s customers and markets john deere’s operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on john deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development john deere’s operations including those outside of the united states may also be affected by nonus regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets 

changes in tax rates tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on john deere 

john deere is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions the company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change john deere’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation if the company’s effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued john deere’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements 

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment while higher commodity prices benefit john deere’s cropproducing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing biofuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices demand for john deere’s dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

as john deere seeks to expand its business globally growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deere’s competition customer base and product offerings 

john deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to additional geographic markets including but not limited to argentina brazil china india and russia and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deere’s other markets negative market conditions resulting from economic and political uncertainties in these and other countries could reduce customer confidence resulting in declines in demand and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could affect writeoffs and provisions for credit losses operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation sanctions and export control requirements repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the company’s financial results as these emerging geographic markets become more important to john deere its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brands are less well known in some emerging markets which could impede john deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances john deere’s reputation andor business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful 

john deere operates in highly competitive markets 

john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition 

john deere’s business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand 

john deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in potentially highgrowth and emerging markets including brazil china india and russia failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deere’s business 

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere’s equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

the demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment cautious consumer spending lower corporate earnings us budget issues and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions causing john deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing john deere’s equipment sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deere’s turf operations and its 

construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deere’s agricultural equipment sales in addition uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing us budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows additionally the company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings 

in addition demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations uncertainty related to the anticipated withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union the risk that one or more other european union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the european union or the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the company’s eurodenominated assets and obligations have an adverse effect on demand for john deere’s products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in europe and globally more specifically it could affect the ability of john deere’s customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all and the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for john deere’s products 

the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency exchange and translation risk 

john deere operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies john deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which john deere earns revenues 

additionally the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of john deere’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on john deere’s results 

because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide john deere’s operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry 

negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide the financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations the financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the financial services segment’s inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s business the financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the financial services segment’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses the financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected equipment returns at lease maturity 

john deere’s equipment operations and financial services segments are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deere’s customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to john deere in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to john deere’s financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates while the company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the company’s net interest income and 

earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

the potential loss of john deere intellectual property through trade secret theft infringement of patents trademark counterfeiting or other loss of rights to exclusive use of john deere intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on the company infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by deere may also have a material adverse effect on the company 

john deere relies on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights in particular we heavily rely on certain john deere trademarks which contribute to john deere’s identity and the recognition of its products and services including but not limited to the “john deere” mark the leaping deer logo the “nothing runs like a deere” slogan the prefix “jd” associated with many products and the green and yellow equipment colors these trademarks as well as the many patents used in our products are integral to the john deere business and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the company 

additionally third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or allege that we infringe their patents we may incur substantial costs if our competitors or other third parties initiate such litigation or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us our business could be adversely affected similarly disputes may arise regarding whether our products or technologies infringe the proprietary rights of others any such infringement could cause third parties including our competitors to bring claims against us resulting in significant costs possible damages and substantial uncertainty 

john deere is subject to extensive anticorruption laws and regulations 

john deere’s global operations must comply with all applicable anticorruption laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act these anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

john deere’s business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment 

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deere’s customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth crop maturity and crop quality natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms droughts diseases and pests can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment sales of turf equipment particularly during the important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products 

john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products changes in the availability and price of these raw materials components and whole goods which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility regulatory instability or change in import tariffs or trade agreements can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business particularly if john deere due to pricing considerations or other factors is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers john deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture its products certain components and parts used in john deere’s products are available from a single supplier and cannot be alternatively sourced quickly supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress capacity constraints trade barriers labor shortages business continuity quality delivery issues or disruptions due to weatherrelated or natural disaster events could affect john deere’s operations and profitability 

john deere’s operations suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over john deere’s international operations in addition private civil litigation on these subjects has increased primarily in the us 

enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict john deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability there can be no assurance that violations of such legislation andor regulations or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deere’s business financial condition or results of operations 

increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

john deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world including the european union’s stage v standard in addition governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce offroad engine emissions these laws and regulations are applicable to engines manufactured by john deere including those used in john deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment john deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results 

john deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities suppliers and customers 

there is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg continue to alter the composition of earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations may lead to international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are continuing to look for ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deere’s operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future ghg legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards john deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time 

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deere’s facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include longterm changes in temperature levels and water availability these potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for john deere’s products and the cost production sales and financial performance of john deere’s operations 

security breaches and other disruptions to john deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with john deere’s operations and could compromise john deere’s and its customers’ and suppliers’ information exposing john deere to liability that would cause john deere’s business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business john deere relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of john deere equipment and from customers of john deere’s financial services operations john deere uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally john deere collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of john deere’s customers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of john deere’s customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to john deere’s business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans john deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee or supplier error or malfeasance or other disruptions during 

the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise john deere’s networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage john deere’s reputation which could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition in addition as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems 

john deere is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection 

the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future john deere collects personally identifiable information pii and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union canada and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions the european union general data protection regulation imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides significant penalties for noncompliance new privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in 2020 with one of the most significant being the california consumer privacy act on january 1 2020 any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations including at newly acquired companies could result in additional cost and liability to us or company officials damage our reputation inhibit sales and otherwise adversely affect our business  

john deere’s ability to execute its strategy is dependent upon the ability to attract train and retain qualified personnel 

john deere’s continued success depends in part on its ability to identify attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel in key functions in particular john deere is dependent on its ability to identify attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel with the requisite education background and industry experience failure to attract train and retain qualified personnel whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants difficulty in recruiting new personnel or the allocation of inadequate resources to training integration and retention of qualified personnel could impair john deere’s ability to execute its business strategy and could adversely affect john deere’s business in addition while john deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees john deere’s operations or ability to execute its business strategy may be impacted by the loss of personnel 

sustained increases in funding obligations under the company’s pension plans may impair the company’s liquidity or financial condition 

the company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees which impose funding obligations the company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected the company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future these factors could significantly increase the company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

changes affecting the availability of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may have consequences for john deere that cannot yet reasonably be predicted 

the company has outstanding debt derivative and receivable transactions with variable interest rates based on libor the libor benchmark has been subject of national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of libor after 2021 these reforms may cause libor to perform differently than in the past and libor may ultimately cease to exist after 2021 alternative benchmark rates may replace libor and could affect the companys debt securities derivative instruments receivables debt payments and receipts at this time it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes to libor any phase out of libor or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate libor exactly which could impact our contracts which terminate after 2021 there is uncertainty about how applicable law the courts or the company will address the replacement of libor with alternative rates on variable rate retail loan contracts and other contracts that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions in addition any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets which could impact our results of operations and cash flows uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities 

john deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected 

from time to time the company makes strategic acquisitions and divestitures or participates in joint ventures acquisitions or joint ventures that the company has entered into or may enter into in the future may involve significant challenges and risks including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance our business strategy or fail to produce satisfactory returns on our investment the company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with its operations in applying internal control processes to these acquisitions in managing strategic investments and in assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of the company’s business integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore john deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s or joint venture partner’s previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets or joint venture’s products or services we may decide to divest ourselves of acquired businesses if we determine any such divestiture is in the best interests of our shareholders and our joint ventures may be terminated at or before their stated terms divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks including failure to advance our business strategy costs or disruptions to the company or negative effects on the company’s product offerings which may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition these divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in the divested business through indemnifications or other financial arrangements such as retained liabilities which could affect the company’s future financial results 

the reallocation of radio frequency rf spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of john deere’s high precision augmented global positioning system gps technology which could impair john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability 

john deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment depend upon the use of rf signals these signals include but are not limited to gps signals other gpslike satellite signals augmented gps services and other rf equipment which link equipment operations owners dealers and technicians these radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies any international or national reallocation of frequency bands including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of john deere’s gpsbased products which could negatively affect john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions for john deere’s agricultural customers the inability to use highprecision augmented gps signals or other rf signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance seed fertilizer fuel and wage costs for construction customers disrupting gps or rf applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies these cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for john deere products

the segment also provides integrated precision agriculture technologies across its portfolio of large equipment john deere has developed a leading approach to precision agriculture technology through advanced communications and telematics on board sensors and computers and precise global navigation satellite systems technology to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields improve soil conservation minimize chemical use and to gather information john deeres advanced telematics systems remotely connect agricultural equipment owners business managers and dealers to agricultural equipment in the field providing realtime alerts and information about equipment location utilization performance and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency 

in addition to the john deere brand the agriculture and turf segment purchases and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the frontier kemper and green systems brand names the segment also manufactures and sells sprayers under the hagie and mazzotti brand names planters and cultivators under the monosem brand name sprayers and planters under the pla brand name carbon fiber sprayer booms under the king agro brand name and walkbehind mowers and scarifiers in select european countries under the sabo brand name john deere manufactures its agriculture and turf equipment for sale primarily through independent retail dealer networks and also builds turf products for sale by mass retailers including the home depot and lowes 

sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and government policies including global trade policies and the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers debt levels and access to financing interest and exchange rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels labor availability and costs energy costs tax policies and other input costs associated with farming other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers 

innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations total agricultural equipment sales in the us and canada and a significant proportion of sales in many countries outside the us and canada are comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters selfpropelled sprayers and seeding equipment however small tractors are an increasingly important part of our global tractor business further john deere offers a number of harvesting solutions to support development of the mechanized harvesting of grain oilseeds cotton sugar and biomass 

retail sales of lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors residential and commercial mowers utility vehicles and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions 

seasonality seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment john deere offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural equipment the segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during offseason periods in australia canada and the us there are typically several used equipment tradein transactions as part of most new agricultural equipment sales to provide support to its dealers for these used equipment tradeins john deere provides dealers in these countries with pools of funds awarded to dealers as a percentage of the dealer cost for eligible new equipment sales dealers can use these funds to defray the costs of carrying or marketing used equipment inventory or to provide financing incentives to customers purchasing the used equipment 

retail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third fiscal quarters john deere has pursued a strategy of building and shipping such equipment as close to retail demand as possible consequently to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year production and shipment schedules of these product lines are normally proportionately higher in the second and third fiscal quarters of each year corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales

international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deeres profitability and growth prospects 

international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of john deeres products services and technology including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deeres multinational business and subject john deere to civil and criminal sanctions for violations john deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements negotiation of new trade agreements and imposition of new and retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products could limit john deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services these trade restrictions and changes in – or uncertainty surrounding – global trade policies may affect john deeres competitive position furthermore the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to john deeres agricultural and forestry customers policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting 

the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world including sales made pursuant to the united statesmexicocanada agreement which was agreed on september 30 2018 and which is designed to replace the north american free trade agreement furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure additionally changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment furthermore sanctions and export controls imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons including financial institutions to certain countries or involving certain products expose john deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies including with respect to russia iran and venezuela although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions violations of these laws or sanctions could have an adverse effect on john deeres reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deeres customers and markets john deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on john deeres customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and its regulations impose or may impose additional reporting stress testing leverage liquidity capital requirements and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory compliance costs for john deere and john deeres financial services operations and could adversely affect john deere and its financial services segments funding activities liquidity structure including relationships with affiliates operations and performance moreover john deeres operations including those outside of the united states may also be impacted by nonus regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets 

changes in tax rates tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on john deere 

john deere is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions the companys domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change john deeres effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation if the companys effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued john deeres operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements 

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment while higher commodity prices benefit john deeres cropproducing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing biofuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect demand for john deeres dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

as john deere seeks to expand its business globally growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deeres competition customer base and product offerings 

john deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to additional geographic markets including but not limited to brazil china india and russia and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deeres other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation sanctions requirements repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the 

companys financial results as these emerging geographic markets become more important to john deere its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brands are less well known in some emerging markets which could impede john deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances john deeres reputation andor business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful 

john deere operates in highly competitive markets 

john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect john deeres business results of operations and financial condition 

john deeres business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand 

john deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in potentially highgrowth and emerging markets including brazil china india and russia failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deeres business 

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deeres equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

the demand for john deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment cautious consumer spending lower corporate earnings us budget issues and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions causing john deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing john deeres equipment sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on john deeres results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deeres agricultural equipment sales in addition uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing us budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the companys earnings and cash flows additionally the companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings 

in addition demand for john deeres products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations uncertainty related to the anticipated withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union the risk that one or more other european union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the european union or the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the companys eurodenominated assets and obligations have an adverse effect on demand for john deeres products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in europe and globally more specifically it could affect the ability of john deeres customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all and the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for john deeres products 

the companys consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency exchange and translation risk 

john deere operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies john deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which john deere earns revenues 

additionally the reporting currency for the companys consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of john deeres assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the companys consolidated financial statements therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on john deeres results 

because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deeres sales worldwide john deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry 

negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deeres sales worldwide the financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations the financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the financial services segments inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on john deeres business the financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the financial services segments writeoffs and provision for credit losses the financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected equipment returns at lease maturity 

john deeres equipment operations and financial services segments are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deeres customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to john deere in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to john deeres financial services segment because such costs affect the segments ability to offer customers competitive financing rates while the company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the companys net interest rate margin – the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the companys net interest income and earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

the potential loss of john deere intellectual property through trade secret theft infringement of patents trademark counterfeiting or other loss of rights to exclusive use of john deere intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on the company infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by deere may also have a material adverse effect on the company 

john deere relies on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights in particular we heavily rely on certain john deere trademarks which contribute to john deeres identity and the recognition of its products and services including but not limited to the john deere mark the leaping deer logo the nothing runs like a deere slogan the prefix jd associated with many products and the green and yellow equipment colors these trademarks as well as the many patents used in our products are integral to the john deere business and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the company 

additionally third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or allege that we infringe their patents we may incur substantial costs if our competitors or other third parties initiate such litigation or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us our business could be adversely affected similarly disputes may arise regarding whether our products or technologies infringe the proprietary rights of others any such infringement could cause third parties including our competitors to bring claims against us resulting in significant costs possible damages and substantial uncertainty 

john deere is subject to extensive anticorruption laws and regulations 

john deeres global operations must comply with all applicable anticorruption laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act these anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on john deeres reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

john deeres business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment 

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deeres customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth crop maturity and crop quality natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms and droughts can have significant negative effects on 

agricultural and livestock production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment sales of turf equipment particularly during the important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products 

john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products changes in the availability and price of these raw materials components and whole goods which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility regulatory instability or change in custom tariffs can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business particularly if john deere due to pricing considerations or other factors is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers john deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture its products certain components and parts used in john deeres products are available from a single supplier and cannot be alternatively sourced quickly supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress capacity constraints labor shortages business continuity quality delivery or disruptions due to weatherrelated or natural disaster events could affect john deeres operations and profitability 

john deeres operations suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over john deeres international operations in addition private civil litigation on these subjects has increased primarily in the us 

enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict john deeres operations or those of our suppliers and customers require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability there can be no assurance that violations of such legislation andor regulations or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deeres operations or those of our suppliers and customers would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deeres business financial condition or results of operations 

increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact john deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

john deeres equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world including the european unions stage v standard in addition governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce offroad engine emissions these laws and regulations are applicable to engines manufactured by john deere including those used in john deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment john deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results 

john deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities suppliers and customers 

there is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg continue to alter the composition of earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations may lead to international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deeres operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future ghg legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deeres global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards john deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time 

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deeres facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deeres operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include longterm changes in temperature levels and water availability these potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for john deeres products and the cost production sales and financial performance of john deeres operations 

security breaches and other disruptions to john deeres information technology infrastructure could interfere with john deeres operations and could compromise john deeres and its customers and suppliers information exposing john deere to liability that would cause john deeres business and reputation to suffer

international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deeres profitability and growth prospects 

international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of john deeres products services and technology including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deeres multinational business and subject john deere to civil and criminal sanctions for violations john deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions including potential limitations on existing trade agreements and trade terms could limit john deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services these restrictions may affect john deeres competitive position additionally john deeres competitive position and results could be adversely affected by changes in–or uncertainty surrounding–us trade policy furthermore the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to john deeres agricultural and forestry customers policies 

impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world including the withdrawal or material modification of the north american free trade agreement furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure additionally changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment furthermore sanctions and export controls imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons including financial institutions to certain countries or involving certain products expose john deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies including with respect to russia cuba iran and sudan although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions violations of these laws or sanctions could have an adverse effect on john deeres reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deeres customers and markets john deeres operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on john deeres customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and its regulations impose or may impose additional reporting stress testing leverage liquidity capital requirements and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatory compliance costs for john deere and john deeres financial services operations and could adversely affect john deere and its financial services segments funding activities liquidity structure including relationships with affiliates operations and performance moreover john deeres operations including those outside of the united states may also be impacted by nonus regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets 

changes in tax rates tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on john deere 

john deere is subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions the companys domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change john deeres effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation if the companys effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued john deeres operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements 

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment while higher commodity prices benefit john deeres cropproducing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing biofuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect demand for john deeres dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

as john deere seeks to expand its business globally growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deeres competition customer base and product offerings 

john deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to additional geographic markets including but not limited to brazil china india and russia and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deeres other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation sanctions requirements repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the 

companys financial results as these emerging geographic markets become more important to john deere its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and the john deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede john deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances john deeres reputation andor business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful 

john deere operates in highly competitive markets 

john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect john deeres business results of operations and financial condition 

john deeres business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand 

john deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in potentially highgrowth and emerging markets including brazil china india and russia failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deeres business 

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deeres equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

the demand for john deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment cautious consumer spending lower corporate earnings us budget issues and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions causing john deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing john deeres equipment sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on john deeres results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deeres agricultural equipment sales in addition uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing us budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the companys earnings and cash flows additionally the companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings 

in addition demand for john deeres products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations uncertainty related to the anticipated withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union the risk that one or more other european union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the european union or the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the companys eurodenominated assets and obligations have an adverse effect on demand for john deeres products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in europe and globally more specifically it could affect the ability of john deeres customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all and the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for john deeres products 

the companys consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency exchange and translation risk 

john deere operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies john deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which john deere earns revenues 

additionally the reporting currency for the companys consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of john deeres assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the companys consolidated financial statements therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on john deeres results 

because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deeres sales worldwide john deeres operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry 

negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deeres sales worldwide the financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations the financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the financial services segments inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on john deeres business the financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the financial services segments writeoffs and provision for credit losses the financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected equipment returns at lease maturity 

john deeres equipment operations and financial services segments are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deeres customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to john deere in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to john deeres financial services segment because such costs affect the segments ability to offer customers competitive financing rates while the company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the companys net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the companys net interest income and earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

the potential loss of john deere intellectual property through trade secret theft infringement of patents trademark counterfeiting or other loss of rights to exclusive use of john deere intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on the company infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by deere may also have a material adverse effect on the company 

john deere relies on a combination of patents trademarks trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights in particular we heavily rely on certain john deere trademarks which contribute to john deeres identity and the recognition of its products and services including but not limited to the john deere mark the leaping deer logo the nothing runs like a deere slogan and the prefix jd associated with many products and the green and yellow equipment colors these trademarks as well as the many patents used in our products are integral to the john deere business and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the company 

additionally third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or allege that we infringe their patents we may incur substantial costs if our competitors or other third parties initiate such litigation or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us our business could be adversely affected similarly disputes may arise regarding whether our products or technologies infringe the proprietary rights of others any such infringement could cause third parties including our competitors to bring claims against us resulting in significant costs possible damages and substantial uncertainty 

john deere is subject to extensive anticorruption laws and regulations 

john deeres global operations must comply with all applicable anticorruption laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act these anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction recently there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on john deeres reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

john deeres business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment 

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deeres customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth crop maturity and crop 

quality natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment sales of turf equipment particularly during the important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products 

john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products changes in the availability and price of these raw materials components and whole goods which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility and regulatory instability can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business particularly if john deere due to pricing considerations or other factors is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers john deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture its products certain components and parts used in john deeres products are available from a single supplier and cannot be resourced quickly supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress capacity constraints labor shortages business continuity quality delivery or disruptions due to weatherrelated or natural disaster events could affect john deeres operations and profitability 

john deeres operations suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over john deeres international operations in addition private civil litigation on these subjects has increased primarily in the us 

enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict john deeres operations or those of our suppliers and customers require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability there can be no assurance that violations of such legislation andor regulations or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deeres operations or those of our suppliers and customers would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deeres business financial condition or results of operations 

increasingly stringent engine emission regulations could impact john deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

john deeres equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world including the european unions stage v standard in addition governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce offroad engine emissions these laws and regulations are applicable to engines manufactured by john deere including those used in john deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment john deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deeres ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results 

john deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities suppliers and customers 

there is a global political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg continue to alter the composition of earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations may lead to international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deeres operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future ghg legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deeres global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards john deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time 

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deeres facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deeres operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include longterm changes in temperature levels and water availability these potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for john deeres products and the cost production sales and financial performance of john deeres operations 

security breaches and other disruptions to john deeres information technology infrastructure could interfere with john deeres operations and could compromise john deeres and its customers and suppliers information exposing john deere to liability that would cause john deeres business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business john deere relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of john deere equipment and from customers of john deeres financial services operations john deere uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally john deere collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of john deeres customers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of john deeres customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to john deeres business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans john deeres information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise john deeres networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage john deeres reputation which could adversely affect john deeres business in addition as security threats continue to evolve we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems 

john deere is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection

the products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets 

  

the financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment in addition the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment finances retail revolving charge accounts and offers extended equipment warranties 

  

john deere’s worldwide agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations are sometimes collectively referred to as the “equipment operations” the financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the “financial services operations” 

  

additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on page 22 the john deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837 the present company was incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1958 

  

the company’s internet address is httpwwwjohndeerecom  through that address the company’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the united states securities and exchange commission securities and exchange commission or commission the information contained on the company’s website is not included in or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

  

market conditions and outlook 

  

the company’s equipment sales are projected to decrease about 7 percent for fiscal year 2016 and decrease about 11 percent for the first quarter compared with the same periods of 2015 for fiscal year 2016 net income attributable to deere  company is anticipated to be about 14 billion 

  

agriculture  turf the company’s agriculture and turf equipment sales are forecast to decrease by about 8 percent for 2016 industry agricultural machinery sales in the us and canada for 2016 are forecast to decrease 15 to 20 percent compared to 2015 industry sales in the european union eu28 nations are forecast to be approximately the same to 5 percent lower in 2016 while south american industry sales are projected to decrease about 10 to 15 percent from 2015 levels asian sales are projected to be about the same or decrease slightly in 2016 

  

industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the us and canada are expected to be approximately the same to 5 percent higher 

  

construction  forestry the company’s construction and forestry sales decreased 9 percent in 2015 and are forecast to decrease about 5 percent in 2016 the decrease in sales reflects the impact of weak conditions in the north american energy sector especially in canada as well as lower sales outside the us and canada global forestry industry sales are expected to decrease about 5 to 10 percent from last year’s strong levels primarily as a result of lower sales in the us and canada 

  

  

financial services fiscalyear 2016 net income attributable to deere  company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately 550 million the outlook reflects a decline from 2015 due primarily to less favorable financing spreads and an increased provision for credit losses additionally 2015 results benefited from a gain on the sale of the crop insurance business 

  

2015 consolidated results compared with 2014 

  

worldwide net income attributable to deere  company in 2015 was 1940 million or 577 per share diluted 581 basic compared with 3162 million or 863 per share diluted 871 basic in 2014 net sales and revenues decreased 20 percent to 28863 million in 2015 compared with 36067 million in 2014 net sales of the worldwide equipment operations declined 22 percent in 2015 to 25775 million from 32961 million last year sales included price realization of 1 percent and an unfavorable currency translation effect of 5 percent equipment net sales in the united states and canada decreased 18 percent for 2015 outside the us and canada net sales decreased 28 percent for the year with an unfavorable currency translation effect of 10 percent for 2015 

  

worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of 2177 million in 2015 compared with 4297 million in 2014 the operating profit decline was due primarily to lower shipment volumes the impact of a less favorable product mix and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange these factors were partially offset by price realization lower selling administrative and general expenses and lower production costs 

  

net income of the company’s equipment operations was 1308 million for 2015 compared with 2548 million in 2014 in addition to the operating factors mentioned above a lower effective tax rate benefited the results the lower rate resulted mainly from a reduction of a valuation allowance recorded during the fourth quarter due to a change in the expected realizable value of a deferred tax asset 

  

net income of the financial services operations attributable to deere  company in 2015 increased to 633 million compared with 624 million in 2014 results improved due to growth in the average credit portfolio the previously announced crop insurance sale and higher crop insurance margins experienced prior to divestiture see note 4 and lower selling administrative and general expenses these factors were partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange translation less favorable financing spreads and higher losses on residual values primarily for construction equipment operating leases the results in 2014 also benefited from a more favorable effective tax rate additional information is presented in the following discussion of the “worldwide financial services operations” 

  

the cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2015 was 781 percent compared with 752 percent last year the increase was due primarily to the impact of a less favorable product mix and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange partially offset by price realization and lower production costs 

  

additional information on 2015 results is presented on pages 2123 

  

equipment operations 

  

agriculture and turf 

  

the john deere agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts under the segment’s global operating model the segment consolidates all markets into four geographical customer focus areas to facilitate deep customer understanding and deliver better customer service the segment’s equipment operations are consolidated into five product platforms — crop harvesting combines corn pickers cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related frontend equipment and sugarcane loaders turf and utility utility vehicles riding lawn equipment walkbehind mowers commercial mowing equipment golf course equipment implements for mowing tilling snow and debris handling aerating and many other residential commercial golf and sports turf care applications and other outdoor power products hay and forage selfpropelled forage harvesters and attachments balers and mowers crop care tillage seeding and application equipment including sprayers nutrient management and soil preparation machinery and tractors loaders and large medium and utility tractors and related attachments john deere also purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale 

  

the segment also provides integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems john deere has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced communications data collection and global satellite positioning technologies to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields improve soil conservation minimize chemical use and to gather information john deere’s advanced telematics systems remotely connect agricultural equipment owners business managers and dealers to agricultural equipment in the field providing realtime alerts and information about equipment location utilization performance and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency 

  

in addition to the john deere brand the agriculture and turf segment purchases and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the frontier kemper and green systems brand names and manufactures and sells walkbehind mowers and scarifiers in select european countries under the sabo brand name john deere manufactures its agriculture and turf equipment for sale primarily through independent retail dealer networks and also builds products for sale by mass retailers including the home depot and lowe’s 

  

  

sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and government policies including the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels and access to financing interest and exchange rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels labor availability and costs energy costs tax policies and other input costs associated with farming other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers 

  

innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the us and canada and a significant proportion of sales in many countries outside the us and canada comprises tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters selfpropelled sprayers and seeding equipment however john deere’s sales of small tractors below 100 horsepower are increasing and john deere offers a number of harvesting solutions to support development of the mechanized harvesting of grain oilseeds cotton sugar and biomass 

  

retail sales of lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors residential and commercial mowers utility vehicles and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions 

  

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment john deere offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural equipment the segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during offseason periods in australia canada and the us there are typically several used equipment tradein transactions as part of most new agricultural equipment sales to provide support to its dealers for these used equipment tradeins john deere provides dealers in these countries with a pool of funds awarded to dealers as a percentage of the dealer cost for eligible new equipment sales dealers can use these funds to defray the costs of carrying or marketing used equipment inventory or to provide financing incentives to customers purchasing the used equipment 

  

retail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third fiscal quarters john deere has pursued a strategy of building and shipping such equipment as close to retail demand as possible consequently to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year production and shipment schedules of these product lines are normally proportionately higher in the second and third fiscal quarters of each year corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales

the dollar amount of backlog orders for the agriculture and turf segment believed to be firm was approximately 24 billion at october 31 2015 compared with 39 billion at october 31 2014 the agriculture and turf backlog is generally highest in the second and third quarters due to seasonal buying trends in these industries john deere generally produces and ships its construction and forestry equipment on average within approximately 60 days after an order is deemed to become firm therefore no significant amount of construction and forestry backlog orders accumulates during any period 

  

trade accounts and notes receivable 

  

trade accounts and notes receivable arise primarily from sales of goods to independent dealers most trade receivables originated by the equipment operations are purchased by the financial services operations the equipment operations compensate the financial services operations at approximate market rates of interest for these receivables additional information appears in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

financial services 

  

us and canada  the financial services segment primarily provides and administers financing for retail purchases from john deere dealers of new equipment manufactured by john deere’s agriculture and turf and construction and forestry segments and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment 

  

the company and john deere construction  forestry company a whollyowned subsidiary of the company are referred to as the “sales companies” john deere capital corporation capital corporation a us financial services subsidiary generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts retail notes from the sales companies these retail notes are acquired by the sales companies through john deere retail dealers in the us john deere financial inc a canadian financial services subsidiary purchases and finances retail notes acquired by john deere canada ulc the company’s canadian sales branch the terms of retail notes and the basis on which the financial services operations acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by agreements with the sales companies the financial services segment also finances and services revolving charge accounts in most

retail notes acquired by the sales companies are immediately sold to the financial services operations the equipment operations are the financial services operations’ major source of business but many retail purchasers of john deere products finance their purchases outside the john deere organization through a variety of sources including commercial banks and finance and leasing companies 

  

the financial services operations offer retail leases to equipment users in the us a small number of leases are executed with units of local government leases are usually written for periods of four months to sixty months and typically contain an option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term retail leases are also offered in a generally similar manner to customers in canada through john deere financial inc and john deere canada ulc 

  

the financial services operations’ terms for financing equipment retail sales other than smaller items financed with unsecured revolving charge accounts generally provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed the financial services operations’ guidelines for minimum down payments which vary with the types of equipment and repayment provisions are generally 10 percent to 30 percent finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain john deere products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions the financial services operations generally receive compensation from the sales companies at approximate market interest rates for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases the cost is accounted for as a deduction in arriving at net sales by the equipment operations 

  

the company has an agreement with capital corporation to make payments to capital corporation such that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 105 to 1 for any fiscal quarter for 2015 and 2014 capital corporation’s ratios were 342 to 1 and 381 to 1 respectively and never less than 326 to 1 and 332 to 1 for any fiscal quarter of 2015 and 2014 respectively the company has also committed to continue to own directly or through one or more whollyowned subsidiaries at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of capital corporation and to maintain capital corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than 50 million the company’s obligations to make payments to capital corporation under the agreement are independent of whether capital corporation is in default on its indebtedness obligations or other liabilities further the company’s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of capital corporation’s indebtedness obligations or other liabilities the company’s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness obligation or liability of capital corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of capital corporation no payments were required under this agreement in 2015 or 2014 

  

outside the us and canada  the financial services operations also offer financing primarily for john deere products in australia brazil china india new zealand russia thailand and in several other countries in africa asia europe and latin america in certain areas financing is offered through cooperation agreements or joint ventures the manner in which the financial services operations offer financing in these countries is affected by a variety of countryspecific laws regulations and customs including those governing property rights and debtor obligations that are subject to change and that may introduce greater risk to the financial services operations 

  

the financial services operations also offer to select customers and dealers credit enhanced international export financing for the purchase of john deere products 

  

additional information on the financial services operations appears on pages 22 23 25 and 27 

  

environmental matters 

  

john deere is subject to a wide variety of local state and federal environmental laws and regulations in the us as well as the environmental laws and regulations of other countries in which john deere conducts business john deere strives to comply and believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations however failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties john deere is involved in the evaluation and cleanup of a limited number of sites but does not expect that these matters or other expenses or liabilities john deere may incur in connection with any noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations or the cleanup of any additional properties will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or competitive position of john deere with respect 

  

  

to acquired properties and businesses or properties and businesses acquired in the future john deere conducts due diligence into potential exposure to environmental liabilities but cannot be certain that it has identified or will identify all adverse environmental conditions compliance with these laws and regulations has added and will continue to add to the cost of john deere’s products 

  

the us environmental protection agency has issued stringent emissions regulations for offroad engines and governmental agencies throughout the world are similarly enacting more stringent laws to reduce offroad engine emissions john deere has achieved and plans to continue to achieve compliance with these regulations through significant investments in the development of new engine technologies and aftertreatment systems compliance with emissions regulations has added and will continue to add to the cost of john deere’s products 

  

employees 

  

at october 31 2015 john deere had approximately 57200 fulltime employees including approximately 28500 employees in the us and canada john deere also retains consultants independent contractors and temporary and parttime workers unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 82 percent of john deere’s us production and maintenance employees approximately 10000 of john deere’s us production and maintenance workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the united auto workers uaw with an expiration date of october 1 2021

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

the following risks are considered the most significant to john deere’s business based upon current knowledge information and assumptions this discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis beginning on page 21 including the risks and uncertainties described in the safe harbor statement on pages 23 through 24 and the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 37 these risk factors and other forwardlooking statements that relate to future events expectations trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business while others could affect all of the company’s businesses although each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated the company except as required by law undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion whether as a result of new developments or otherwise the risks described in this annual report on form 10k and the “safe harbor statement” in this report are not the only risks faced by the company 

  

  

international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deere’s profitability and growth prospects 

  

international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of john deere’s products services and technology including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deere’s multinational business and subject john deere to civil and criminal sanctions john deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions could limit john deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services these restrictions may affect john deere’s competitive position furthermore the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to john deere’s agricultural and forestry customers policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure additionally changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales or transactions to specific persons including financial institutions or countries or based on product classification expose john deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions these laws and sanctions particularly with respect to eastern europe are changing rapidly violations of these laws could have an adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

  

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

  

policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deere’s customers and markets john deere’s operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on john deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on taxes and spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development 

  

changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements  

  

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment lower farm commodity prices directly affect farm incomes which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment while higher commodity prices benefit john deere’s cropproducing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing biofuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect demand for john deere’s dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

  

as john deere seeks to expand its business globally growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deere’s competition customer base and product offerings 

  

john deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to brazil china india and russia in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deere’s other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural 

  

  

practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation sanctions requirements and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the company’s financial results as these emerging geographic markets become more important to john deere its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and the john deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede john deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances john deere’s reputation andor business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful 

  

john deere operates in highly competitive markets 

  

john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

john deere is subject to extensive anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

john deere’s global operations must comply with all applicable laws which may include the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws these anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction recently there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

  

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere’s equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

  

the demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment cautious consumer spending lower corporate earnings us budget issues and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions causing john deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing john deere’s equipment sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deere’s agricultural equipment sales in addition uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing us budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows additionally the company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings 

  

in addition demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations and the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the company’s euro denominated assets and obligations have an adverse effect on demand for john deere’s products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in europe and globally more specifically it could affect the ability of john deere’s customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for john deere’s products 

  

  

the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency translation risk 

  

john deere operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies john deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which john deere earns revenues additionally the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of john deere’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on john deere’s results 

  

because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide john deere’s operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry 

  

in recent years negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide the financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations the financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the financial services segment’s inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s business the financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the financial services segment’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act act and the regulations implementing the act impose additional supervisory financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on john deere and john deere’s financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect john deere and its financial services segment 

  

the act was enacted on july 21 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry including equipment financing and securitizations the act directs federal agencies including the consumer financial protection bureau the board of governors of the federal reserve system the commodity futures trading commission the federal deposit insurance corporation and others to adopt rules to regulate depository institutions nonbank financial institutions thrift holding companies the consumer finance industry and the capital markets including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts although the effects of the act on the capital markets and the financial industry are not fully known until all the regulations have been finalized and implemented the act and its regulations impose additional reporting requirements stress testing requirements leverage liquidity requirements capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatoryrelated compliance costs for john deere and john deere’s financial services operations and could adversely affect john deere and its financial services segment’s funding activities liquidity structure including relationships with affiliates operations and performance moreover john deere’s operations including those outside of the united states will also be impacted by nonus regulatory reforms including basel iii being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets 

  

john deere’s business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand 

  

john deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in potentially highgrowth and emerging markets including brazil china india and russia failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deere’s business 

  

john deere’s business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment 

  

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deere’s customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting 

  

  

from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth crop maturity and crop quality natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment sales of turf equipment particularly during the important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

  

changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products 

  

john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products changes in the availability and price of these raw materials components and whole goods which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business particularly if john deere due to pricing considerations or other factors is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers john deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture its products certain components and parts used in john deere’s products are available from a single supplier and cannot be resourced quickly supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress capacity constraints business continuity quality delivery or disruptions due to weatherrelated or natural disaster events could affect john deere’s operations and profitability 

  

john deere’s equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

  

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deere’s customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to john deere in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to john deere’s financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates in addition changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the company’s net interest income and earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

  

john deere’s operations suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over john deere’s international operations in addition private civil litigation on these subjects has increased primarily in the us 

  

enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict john deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability there can be no assurance that violations of such legislation andor regulations or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deere’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

  

john deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards including final tier 4stage iv nonroad diesel emission requirements in the us and european union in addition governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce offroad engine emissions these standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by john deere and used in many models of john deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment john deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would 

  

  

prevent timely compliance these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results 

  

security breaches and other disruptions to john deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with john deere’s operations and could compromise john deere’s and its customers’ and suppliers’ information exposing john deere to liability that would cause john deere’s business and reputation to suffer 

  

in the ordinary course of business john deere relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of john deere equipment and from customers of john deere’s financial services operations john deere uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally john deere collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of john deere’s customers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of john deere’s customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to john deere’s business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans john deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise john deere’s networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage john deere’s reputation which could adversely affect john deere’s business in addition as security threats continue to evolve we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems 

  

john deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities suppliers and customers 

  

there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg continue to alter the composition of earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations may lead to international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deere’s operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future ghg legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards john deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time 

  

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deere’s facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include longterm changes in temperature levels and water availability these potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for john deere’s products and the cost production sales and financial performance of john deere’s operations 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under the company’s pension plans may impair the company’s liquidity or financial condition 

  

the company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees which impose on us funding obligations the company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected the company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future these factors could significantly increase the company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

the reallocation of radio frequency rf spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of john deere’s high precision augmented global positioning system gps technology which could impair john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability 

  

john deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment depend upon the use of rf signals these signals include but are not limited to gps signals other gpslike satellite signals augmented gps services and other rf equipment which link equipment operations owners dealers and technicians these radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies any international or national reallocation of frequency bands including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of john deere’s gpsbased products which could negatively affect john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions for john deere’s agricultural customers the inability to use highprecision augmented gps signals or other rf signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance seed fertilizer fuel and wage costs for construction customers disrupting gps or rf applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies these cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for john deere products

the products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets 

  

the financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment in addition the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment finances retail revolving charge accounts and offers crop riskmitigation products and extended equipment warranties 

  

john deere’s worldwide agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations are sometimes collectively referred to as the “equipment operations” the financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the “financial services operations” 

  

additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on page 22 the john deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837 the present company was incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1958 

  

the company’s internet address is httpwwwjohndeerecom  through that address the company’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the united states securities and exchange commission securities and exchange commission or commission the information contained on the company’s website is not included in or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

  

market conditions and outlook 

  

the company’s equipment sales are projected to decrease about 15 percent for fiscal year 2015 and decrease about 21 percent for the first quarter compared with the same periods of 2014 for fiscal year 2015 net income attributable to deere  company is anticipated to be about 19 billion 

  

agriculture  turf the company’s worldwide sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to decrease by about 20 percent for fiscal year 2015 as a result of weaker conditions in the global farm economy lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes are putting pressure on demand for agricultural machinery especially for larger models conditions are more positive in the us livestock sector providing support to the sale of smaller sizes of equipment based on these factors industry sales for agricultural machinery in the us and canada are forecast to be down 25 to 30 percent for 2015 

  

industry sales in the european union eu 28 nations are forecast to decrease about 10 percent due to lower crop prices and farm incomes as well as potential pressure on the dairy sector in south america industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to decrease about 10 percent as a result of the headwinds affecting agricultural producers industry sales in the commonwealth of independent states are expected to deteriorate further due in part to tight credit conditions asian sales are projected to decrease slightly with most of the decline centered in china 

  

  

us and canada industry sales of turf and utility equipment are expected to be the same to up 5 percent for 2015 benefitting from general economic growth 

  

construction  forestry the company’s worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to increase by about 5 percent for 2015 the gain reflects further economic recovery and higher housing starts in the us as well as sales increases outside the us and canada global forestry sales are expected to be about the same as the attractive levels of 2014 

  

financial services fiscalyear 2015 net income attributable to deere  company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately 610 million the outlook reflects a decline from 2014 due primarily to an expected increase in the provision for credit losses versus the low level of 2014 and a less favorable tax rate these factors are projected to be partially offset by growth in the credit portfolio and higher crop insurance margins 

  

2014 consolidated results compared with 2013 

  

worldwide net income attributable to deere  company in 2014 was 3162 million or 863 per share diluted 871 basic compared with 3537 million or 909 per share diluted 918 basic in 2013 net sales and revenues decreased 5 percent to 36067 million in 2014 compared with 37795 million in 2013 net sales of the equipment operations decreased 6 percent in 2014 to 32961 million from 34998 million last year the sales decrease was largely due to lower shipment volumes and an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of 1 percent partially offset by price realization of 2 percent net sales in the us and canada decreased 8 percent in 2014 net sales outside the us and canada decreased 3 percent in 2014 which included an unfavorable effect of 1 percent for foreign currency translation 

  

worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of 4297 million in 2014 compared with 5058 million in 2013 the operating profit decline was due primarily to the impact of lower shipment and production volumes a less favorable product mix the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange and higher production costs primarily related to the impact of engine emission programs the decline was partially offset by price realization last year’s results were also affected by impairment charges for the company’s john deere landscapes and john deere water operations 

  

the equipment operations’ net income was 2548 million in 2014 compared with 2974 million in 2013 the same operating factors mentioned above affected these results 

  

net income of the financial services operations attributable to deere  company in 2014 increased to 624 million compared with 565 million in 2013 the improvement was due primarily to growth in the credit portfolio a more favorable effective tax rate partially offset by lower crop insurance margins higher selling administrative and general expenses and a higher provision for credit losses additional information is presented in the discussion of the “worldwide financial services operations” on page 22 

  

the cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2014 was 752 percent compared with 733 percent last year the increase was due primarily to a less favorable product mix the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange and higher production costs largely related to engine emission requirements partially offset by price realization

equipment operations 

  

agriculture and turf 

  

the john deere agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts the segment’s global operating model is designed to enable faster geographic growth and increase the segment’s competitiveness under this model the segment consolidates all markets into four geographical customer focus areas to facilitate deep customer understanding and deliver better customer service the segment’s equipment operations are consolidated into five product platforms — crop harvesting combines corn pickers cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related frontend equipment and sugarcane loaders turf and utility utility vehicles riding lawn equipment walkbehind mowers commercial mowing equipment golf course equipment implements for mowing tilling snow and debris handling aerating and many other residential commercial golf and sports turf care applications and other outdoor power products hay and forage selfpropelled forage harvesters and attachments balers and mowers crop care tillage seeding and application equipment including sprayers nutrient management and soil preparation machinery and tractors loaders and large medium and utility tractors and related attachments john deere also purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale 

  

  

the segment also provides integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems john deere has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced communications data collection and global satellite positioning technologies to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields improve soil conservation minimize chemical use and to gather information john deere’s advanced telematics systems remotely connect agricultural equipment owners business managers and dealers to agricultural equipment in the field providing realtime alerts and information about equipment location utilization performance and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency 

  

in addition to the john deere brand the agriculture and turf segment purchases and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the frontier kemper and green systems brand names and manufactures and sells walkbehind mowers and scarifiers in select european countries under the sabo brand name john deere manufactures its agriculture and turf equipment for sale primarily through independent retail dealer networks and also builds products for sale by mass retailers including the home depot and lowe’s 

  

sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and government policies including the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels and access to financing interest and exchange rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels labor availability and costs energy costs and other input costs associated with farming other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers 

  

innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the us and canada and a growing proportion of sales in many countries outside the us and canada comprises tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters selfpropelled sprayers and seeding equipment however as john deere expands its business globally especially in developing countries where demand for smaller equipment is greater john deere’s sales of small tractors below 100 horsepower are increasing and john deere offers a number of harvesting solutions to support development of the mechanized harvesting of grain oilseeds cotton sugar and biomass 

  

retail sales of lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors residential and commercial mowers utility vehicles and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions 

  

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment john deere offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural equipment the segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during offseason periods in australia canada and the us there are typically several used equipment tradein transactions as part of most new agricultural equipment sales to provide support to its dealers for these used equipment tradeins john deere provides dealers in these countries with a pool of funds awarded to dealers as a percentage of the dealer cost for eligible new equipment sales dealers can use these funds to defray the costs of carrying or marketing used equipment inventory or to provide financing incentives to customers purchasing the used equipment 

  

retail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third fiscal quarters john deere has pursued a strategy of building and shipping such equipment as close to retail demand as possible consequently to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year production and shipment schedules of these product lines are normally proportionately higher in the second and third fiscal quarters of each year corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales

john deere is subject to a wide variety of local state and federal environmental laws and regulations in the us as well as the environmental laws and regulations of other countries in which john deere conducts business john deere strives to comply and believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations however failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties john deere is involved in the evaluation and cleanup of a limited number of sites but does not expect that these matters or other expenses or liabilities john deere may incur in connection with any noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations or the cleanup of any additional properties will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or competitive position of john deere with respect to acquired properties and businesses or properties and businesses acquired in the future john deere conducts due diligence into potential exposure to environmental liabilities but cannot be certain that it has identified or will identify all adverse environmental conditions compliance with these laws and regulations has added and will continue to add to the cost of john deere’s products 

  

the us environmental protection agency has issued increasingly stringent regulations concerning permissible emissions of offroad engines and governmental agencies throughout the world are similarly enacting more stringent laws to reduce offroad engine emissions john deere has achieved and plans to continue to achieve compliance with these regulations through significant investments in the development of new engine technologies and aftertreatment systems compliance with emissions regulations has added and will continue to add to the cost of john deere’s products

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

the following risks are considered the most significant to john deere’s business based upon current knowledge information and assumptions this discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis beginning on page 21 including the risks and uncertainties described in the safe harbor statement on pages 23 through 24 and the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 36 these risk factors and other forwardlooking statements that relate to future events expectations trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business while others could affect all of the company’s businesses although each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated the company except as required by law undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion whether as a result of new developments or otherwise the risks described in this annual report on form 10k and the “safe harbor statement” in this report are not the only risks faced by the company additional risks and uncertainties may also materially affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results you should not consider these risk factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

  

international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deere’s profitability and growth prospects  

  

international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of john deere’s products services and technology including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deere’s multinational business and subject john deere to civil and criminal sanctions john deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions could limit john deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services these restrictions may affect john deere’s competitive position furthermore the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to john deere’s agricultural and forestry customers policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure additionally changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales or transactions to specific persons including financial institutions or countries or based on product classification expose john deere to potential criminal and civil sanctions although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions these laws and sanctions particularly with respect to eastern europe are changing rapidly violations of these laws could have an adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

  

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

  

policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deere’s customers and markets john deere’s operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on john deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on taxes and spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development 

  

changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements 

  

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment while higher commodity prices benefit john deere’s cropproducing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing biofuel demands may cause farmers to change the 

  

  

types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect demand for john deere’s gasoline or dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

  

as john deere seeks to expand its business globally growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deere’s competition customer base and product offerings 

  

john deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to brazil china india and russia in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deere’s other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation sanctions requirements and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the company’s financial results as these emerging geographic markets become more important to john deere its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and the john deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede john deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances john deere’s reputation andor business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful 

  

john deere operates in highly competitive markets 

  

john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

john deere is subject to extensive anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

john deere’s global operations must comply with all applicable laws which may include the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws these anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction recently there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have an adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

  

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere’s equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

  

the demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment cautious consumer spending lower corporate earnings us budget issues and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions causing john deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing john deere’s equipment sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions failure of increases in construction activity and housing starts to continue and be sustained could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deere’s agricultural equipment sales in addition uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing us budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows additionally the company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings 

  

  

in addition demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations and the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the company’s euro denominated assets and obligations have an adverse effect on demand for john deere’s products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in europe and globally more specifically it could affect the ability of john deere’s customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for john deere’s products 

  

the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency translation risk 

  

john deere operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies john deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which john deere earns revenues additionally the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of john deere’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on john deere’s results 

  

because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide john deere’s operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry 

  

in recent years negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide the financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations the financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the financial services segment’s inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s business the financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the financial services segment’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act act and the regulations implementing the act impose additional supervisory financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on john deere and john deere’s financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect john deere and its financial services segment 

  

the act was enacted on july 21 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry including equipment financing and securitizations the act directs federal agencies including the consumer financial protection bureau the board of governors of the federal reserve system the commodity futures trading commission the federal deposit insurance corporation and others to adopt rules to regulate depository institutions nonbank financial institutions thrift holding companies the consumer finance industry and the capital markets including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts although the effects of the act on the capital markets and the financial industry are not fully known until all the regulations have been finalized and implemented the act and its regulations impose additional reporting requirements stress testing requirements leverage liquidity requirements capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatoryrelated compliance costs for john deere and john deere’s financial services operations and could adversely affect john deere and its financial services segment’s funding activities liquidity structure including relationships with affiliates operations and performance moreover john deere’s operations including those outside of the united states will also be impacted by nonus regulatory reforms including basel iii being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets 

  

john deere’s business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand 

  

john deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough 

  

  

understanding of john deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in potentially highgrowth markets including brazil china india and russia failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deere’s business 

  

john deere’s business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment 

  

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deere’s customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth crop maturity and crop quality natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment in addition poor or unusual weather conditions at critical periods in the planting growing or harvesting seasons can impact the profitability of crop risk mitigation products sales of turf equipment particularly during the important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

  

changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products  

  

john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products changes in the availability and price of these raw materials components and whole goods which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business particularly if john deere due to pricing considerations or other factors is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers john deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture its products certain components and parts used in john deere’s products are available from a single supplier and cannot be resourced quickly supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress capacity constraints business continuity quality delivery or disruptions due to weatherrelated or natural disaster events could affect john deere’s operations and profitability 

  

john deere’s equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

  

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deere’s customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to john deere in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to john deere’s financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates in addition changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the company’s net interest income and earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

  

john deere’s operations suppliers and customers are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over john deere’s international operations in addition private civil litigation on these subjects has increased primarily in the us 

  

enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict john deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability there can be no assurance that violations of such legislation andor regulations or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deere’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

  

increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

  

john deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards including usepa interim tier 4stage iiib and final tier 4stage iv nonroad diesel emission requirements in the us and european union these standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by john deere and used in many models of john deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment john deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results 

  

security breaches and other disruptions to john deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with john deere’s operations and could compromise john deere’s and its customers’ and suppliers’ information exposing john deere to liability that would cause john deere’s business and reputation to suffer 

  

in the ordinary course of business john deere relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of john deere equipment and from customers of john deere’s financial services operations john deere uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally john deere collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of john deere’s customers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of john deere’s customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to john deere’s business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans john deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise john deere’s networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage john deere’s reputation which could adversely affect john deere’s business 

  

john deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities suppliers and customers 

  

there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg continue to alter the composition of earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations may lead to international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deere’s operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future ghg legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards john deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time 

  

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deere’s facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include longterm changes in temperature levels and water availability these potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for john deere’s products and the cost production sales and financial performance of john deere’s operations 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under the company’s pension plans may impair the company’s liquidity or financial condition 

  

the company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees which impose on us funding obligations the 

  

  

company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected the company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future these factors could significantly increase the company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the reallocation of radio frequency rf spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of john deere’s high precision augmented global positioning system gps technology which could impair john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability 

  

john deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment depend upon the use of rf signals these signals include but are not limited to gps signals other gpslike satellite signals augmented gps services and other rf equipment which link equipment operations owners dealers and technicians these radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies any international or national reallocation of frequency bands including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of john deere’s gpsbased products which could negatively affect john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions for john deere’s agricultural customers the inability to use highprecision augmented gps signals or other rf signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance seed fertilizer fuel and wage costs for construction customers disrupting gps or rf applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies these cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for john deere products

raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions could limit john deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services these restrictions may affect john deere’s competitive position furthermore the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to john deere’s agricultural and forestry customers policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure additionally changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the us and other governments prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification expose john deere to criminal and civil sanctions although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws violations of these laws could have an adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

  

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

  

policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deere’s customers and markets john deere’s operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on john deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on taxes and spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development 

  

changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements 

  

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment while higher commodity prices benefit john deere’s cropproducing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing biofuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect demand for john deere’s gasoline or dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

  

as john deere seeks to expand its business globally growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deere’s competition customer base and product offerings 

  

john deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to brazil china india and russia in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deere’s other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the company’s financial results as these emerging geographic markets become more important to john deere its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and the john deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede john 

  

  

deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances john deere’s reputation andor business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful 

  

john deere operates in highly competitive markets 

  

john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

john deere is subject to extensive anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

john deere’s global operations must comply with all applicable laws which may include the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act or other anticorruption laws these anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction recently there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and an adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

  

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere’s equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

  

the demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment cautious consumer spending lower corporate earnings us budget issues and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions causing john deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their propensity to purchase john deere’s equipment sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions sustained low levels or decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deere’s agricultural equipment sales in addition uncertain or negative outlook with respect to ongoing us budget issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows additionally the company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings 

  

in addition demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations and the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the company’s euro denominated assets and obligations have an adverse effect on demand for john deere’s products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in europe and globally more specifically it could affect the ability of john deere’s customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for john deere’s products 

  

the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency translation risk 

  

john deere operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies john deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which john deere earn revenues additionally the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of john deere’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

  

therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on john deere’s results 

  

because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide john deere’s operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry 

  

in recent years negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide the financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations the financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the financial services segment’s inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s business the financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the financial services segment’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act act and the regulations implementing the act impose additional supervisory financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on john deere and john deere’s financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect john deere and its financial services segment 

  

the act was enacted on july 21 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry including equipment financing and securitizations the act directs federal agencies including the consumer financial protection bureau the board of governors of the federal reserve system the commodity futures trading commission the federal deposit insurance corporation and others to adopt rules to regulate depository institutions nonbank financial institutions thrift holding companies the consumer finance industry and the capital markets including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts although the effects of the act on the capital markets and the financial industry are largely unknown until all the regulations have been finalized and implemented the act and its regulations impose additional reporting requirements stress testing requirements leverage capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatoryrelated compliance costs for john deere and john deere’s financial services operations and could adversely affect john deere and its financial services segment’s funding activities liquidity structure including relationships with affiliates operations and performance the board of governors of the federal reserve system has recently finalized capital requirements for certain institutions including thrift holding companies under the final rules certain riskbased capital levels will need to be maintained in order to avoid the imposition of new restrictions on making dividends and other capital payouts moreover john deere’s operations including those outside of the united states will also be impacted by nonus regulatory reforms including basel iii being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets 

  

john deere’s business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand 

  

john deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in potentially highgrowth markets including brazil china india and russia failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deere’s business 

  

john deere’s business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment 

  

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deere’s customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth crop maturity and crop quality natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms and droughts can have significant negative effects on 

  

  

agricultural and livestock production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment in addition poor or unusual weather conditions at critical periods in the planting growing or harvesting seasons can impact the profitability of crop risk mitigation products sales of turf equipment particularly during the important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

  

changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products 

  

john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products changes in the availability and price of these raw materials components and whole goods which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business particularly if john deere due to pricing considerations or other factors is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers john deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture its products certain components and parts used in john deere’s products are available from a single supplier and cannot be resourced quickly supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress capacity constraints business continuity quality delivery or disruptions due to weatherrelated or natural disaster events could affect john deere’s operations and profitability 

  

john deere’s equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

  

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deere’s customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to john deere in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to john deere’s financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates in addition changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the company’s net interest income and earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

  

john deere’s operations are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over john deere’s international operations in addition private civil litigation on these subjects has increased primarily in the us 

  

enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict john deere’s operations require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability there can be no assurance that violations of such legislation andor regulations or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deere’s operations would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deere’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

  

john deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards including usepa interim tier 4stage iiib and final tier 4stage iv nonroad diesel emission requirements in the us and european union these standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by john deere and used in many models of john deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment john deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results 

  

  

john deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities suppliers and customers 

 

there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg continue to alter the composition of earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations may lead to international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deere’s operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs the regulation of ghg emissions from nonroad sources could require further changes to the design of john deere’s engines and equipment increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future ghg legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards john deere is unable to predict its potential impact at this time 

 

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deere’s facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include changes in weather patterns including drought and rainfall levels water availability storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels these potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for john deere’s products and the cost production sales and financial performance of john deere’s operations 

 

sustained increases in funding obligations under the company’s pension plans may impair the company’s liquidity or financial condition 

 

the company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees which impose on us funding obligations the company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns on pension investments being lower than expected the company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future these factors could significantly increase the company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

 

the reallocation of radio frequency rf spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of john deere’s high precision augmented global positioning system gps technology which could impair john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability 

  

john deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment depend upon the use of rf signals these signals include but are not limited to gps signals other gpslike satellite signals augmented gps services and other rf equipment which link equipment operations owners dealers and technicians these radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies any international or national reallocation of frequency bands including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of john deere’s gpsbased products which could negatively affect john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions for john deere’s agricultural customers the inability to use highprecision augmented gps signals or other rf signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance seed fertilizer fuel and wage costs for construction customers disrupting gps or rf applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies these cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for john deere products 

  

security breaches and other disruptions to john deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with john deere’s operations and could compromise john deere’s and its customers’ and suppliers’ information exposing john deere to liability that would cause john deere’s business and reputation to suffer 

  

in the ordinary course of business john deere relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers 

  

  

of john deere equipment and from customers of john deere’s financial services operations john deere uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally john deere collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of john deere’s customers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of john deere’s customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to john deere’s business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans john deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise john deere’s networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage john deere’s reputation which could adversely affect john deere’s business

products 

  

deere  company the company and its subsidiaries collectively john deere have operations which are categorized into three major business segments 

  

the agriculture and turf segment primarily manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts — including large medium and utility tractors loaders combines corn pickers cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related frontend equipment and sugarcane loaders tillage seeding and application equipment including sprayers nutrient management and soil preparation machinery hay and forage equipment including selfpropelled forage harvesters and attachments balers and mowers turf and utility equipment including riding lawn equipment and walkbehind mowers golf course equipment utility vehicles and commercial mowing equipment along with a broad line of associated implements integrated agricultural management systems technology precision agricultural irrigation equipment and supplies landscape and nursery products and other outdoor power products 

  

the construction and forestry segment primarily manufactures and distributes a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction earthmoving material handling and timber harvesting — including backhoe loaders crawler dozers and loaders fourwheeldrive loaders excavators motor graders articulated dump trucks landscape loaders skidsteer loaders and log skidders feller bunchers log loaders log forwarders log harvesters and related attachments 

  

the products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets 

  

the financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment in addition the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment finances retail revolving charge accounts and operating loans and offers crop risk mitigation products and extended equipment warranties 

  

john deere’s worldwide agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations are sometimes referred to as the “equipment operations” the financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the “financial services operations” 

  

additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on pages 2223 the john deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837 the present company was incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1958 

  

the company’s internet address is httpwwwjohndeerecom  through that address the company’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the united states securities and exchange commission securities and exchange commission or commission the information contained on the company’s website is not included in or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

  

market conditions and outlook 

  

the company’s equipment sales are projected to increase by about 5 percent for fiscal year 2013 and about 10 percent for the first quarter compared with the same periods of 2012 for fiscal year 2013 net income attributable to deere  company is anticipated to be approximately 32 billion 

  

agriculture  turf the company’s worldwide sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to increase by about 4 percent for fiscal year 2013 relatively high commodity prices and strong farm incomes are expected to continue supporting a favorable level of demand for farm machinery during the year the company’s sales are expected to benefit from global expansion and lines of advanced new equipment 

  

industry sales for agricultural machinery in the united states us and canada are forecast to be about the same for 2013 in relation to the prior year’s healthy levels caution around the us livestock and dairy sectors is expected to offset continued strength in demand for large equipment such as highhorsepower tractors 

  

fiscal year industry sales in the european union eu27 nations of western and central europe are forecast to be about the same to 5 percent lower due to continuing deterioration in the overall economy and a poor harvest in the uk sales in the commonwealth of independent states are expected to be modestly higher in 2013 in south america industry sales are projected to increase about 10 percent as a result of favorable commodity prices and increased planting intentions industry sales in asia are projected to be approximately the same as 2012 due to softer economic conditions in india and china 

  

  

us and canada industry sales of turf and utility equipment are expected to increase about 5 percent for 2013 reflecting some improvement in the us economy the company’s sales are expected to increase more than the industry due to the impact of new products 

  

construction  forestry the company’s worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to increase by about 8 percent for fiscal year 2013 due in part to modest improvement in us economic conditions sales in world forestry markets are projected to be about the same for the year as further weakness in european markets offsets stronger demand in the us 

  

financial services fiscal year 2013 net income attributable to deere  company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately 500 million the forecast improvement is primarily due to expected growth in the credit portfolio and lower crop insurance claims these factors are projected to be partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses which is anticipated to return to a more typical level

worldwide net income attributable to deere  company in 2012 was 3065 million or 763 per share diluted 772 basic compared with 2800 million or 663 per share diluted 671 basic in 2011 net sales and revenues increased 13 percent to 36157 million in 2012 compared with 32013 million in 2011 net sales of the equipment operations increased 14 percent in 2012 to 33501 million from 29466 million last year the sales increase included improved price realization of 4 percent and an unfavorable foreign currency translation of 3 percent net sales in the us and canada increased 20 percent in 2012 net sales outside the us and canada increased by 5 percent in 2012 which included an unfavorable effect of 6 percent for foreign currency translation 

  

worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of 4397 million in 2012 compared with 3839 million in 2011 the higher operating profit was primarily due to the impact of improved price realization and higher shipment volumes partially offset by higher production and raw material costs unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange increased research and development expenses higher selling administrative and general expenses and a goodwill impairment charge the increase in production costs related to new products engine emission requirements and incentive compensation expenses 

  

the equipment operations’ net income was 2616 million in 2012 compared with 2329 million in 2011 the same operating factors mentioned above as well as an increase in the effective tax rate and interest expense affected these results 

  

net income of the financial services operations attributable to deere  company in 2012 decreased to 460 million compared with 471 million in 2011 the decrease was primarily a result of increased selling administrative and general expenses higher reserves for crop insurance claims and narrower financing spreads partially offset by growth in the credit portfolio and a lower provision for credit losses additional information is presented in the discussion of the “worldwide financial services operations” on page 22 

  

the cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2012 was 746 percent compared with 744 percent last year the increase was primarily due to higher production costs increased raw material costs and unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange partially offset by improved price realization

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

the following risks are considered the most significant to john deere’s business based upon current knowledge information and assumptions this discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis beginning on page 21 including the risks and uncertainties described in the safe harbor statement on pages 23 through 25 and the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 36 these risk factors and other forwardlooking statements that relate to future events expectations trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business while others could affect all of the company’s businesses although each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated the company except as required by law undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion whether as a result of new developments or otherwise the risks described in this annual report on form 10k and the “safe harbor statement” in this report are not the only risks faced by the company additional risks and uncertainties may also materially affect the company’s business financial condition or operating results you should not consider these risk factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions 

  

international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deere’s profitability and growth prospects  

  

international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting trade including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deere’s multinational business john deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis while trade agreements may expand opportunities trade restrictions could limit john deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services furthermore the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to john deere’s agricultural and forestry customers policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities including the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the world trade organization could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities which may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure furthermore changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment 

  

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

  

policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deere’s customers and markets john deere’s operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform which could have an adverse affect on the financial services segment and john deere’s customers by limiting their ability to finance purchases of john deere products governmental policies on taxes and spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development 

  

changing worldwide demand for food and for different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements 

  

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment while higher commodity prices will benefit john deere’s crop producing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing biofuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect demand for john deere’s gasoline or dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

  

  

as john deere seeks to expand its business globally growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deere’s competition customer base and product offerings 

  

john deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to brazil china india and russia in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deere’s other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the company’s financial results as these emerging geographic markets become more important to john deere its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and the john deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede john deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances john deere’s reputation andor business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful 

  

john deere operates in highly competitive markets 

  

john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

john deere is subject to extensive anticorruption laws and regulations 

  

john deere’s international operations must comply with us law including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the fcpa and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in the foreign jurisdiction recently there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws although john deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and an adverse effect on john deere’s reputation business and results of operations and financial condition 

  

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere’s equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

  

the demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment cautious consumer spending lower corporate earnings and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions causing john deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their propensity to purchase john deere’s equipment sustained or negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry segment are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions sustained low levels or decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deere’s agricultural equipment sales in addition negative or uncertain economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in capital market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows additionally the company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings 

  

concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro the potential reintroduction of individual currencies within the eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financing 

  

concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the 

  

  

company’s euro denominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally and more specifically on the ability of the company and john deere’s customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for john deere products 

  

the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency translation risk 

  

john deere operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies john deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues additionally the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of john deere’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on john deere’s results 

  

because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere sales worldwide john deere’s operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry 

  

in recent years negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide the financial services segment is exposed to the credit risk of its various counterparties the financial services segment may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the financial services segment’s inability to access funds or to access funds at cost effective rates to support its financing activities to john deere’s customers could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s business the financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the financial services segment’s writeoffs and provision for credit losses 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act act and the regulations implementing the act could impose additional supervisory financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on john deere and john deere’s financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect john deere and its financial services segment 

  

the act was enacted on july 21 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry including equipment financing and securitizations the act directs federal agencies including the consumer financial protection bureau the us federal reserve board the commodity futures trading commission the federal deposit insurance corporation and others to adopt rules to regulate depository institutions nonbank financial institutions thrift holding companies the consumer finance industry and the capital markets including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts although the effects of the act on the capital markets and the financial industry are largely unknown until regulations have been finalized and implemented the act and its regulations are expected to impose additional reporting requirements leverage capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatoryrelated compliance costs for john deere and john deere’s financial services operations and could adversely affect john deere and its financial services segment’s funding activities liquidity structure including relationships with affiliates operations and performance the us federal reserve board has recently proposed capital requirements for certain institutions including thrift holding companies under the proposed rules certain riskbased capital levels would need to be maintained in order to avoid the imposition of new restrictions on making dividends and other capital payouts moreover our operations including those outside of the united states could also be impacted by nonus regulatory reforms including basel iii being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets 

  

john deere’s business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand 

  

john deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in potential high growth markets including brazil china india and russia failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deere’s business 

  

  

john deere’s business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agricultural and turf equipment 

  

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deere’s customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can also prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth crop maturity and crop quality natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment in addition poor or unusual weather conditions at critical periods in the planting growing or harvesting seasons can impact the profitability of crop risk mitigation products sales of turf equipment particularly during the important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

  

changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products  

  

john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products changes in the availability and price of these raw materials components and whole goods which have fluctuated significantly in the past and which are more likely to occur during times of economic volatility can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business particularly if john deere due to pricing considerations or other factors was unable to recover the increased costs from its customers john deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture its products certain components and parts used in john deere’s products are available from a single supplier and cannot be resourced quickly supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial viability capacity constraints business continuity quality delivery or disruptions due to weather related or natural disaster events could affect john deere’s operations and profitability 

  

john deere’s equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

  

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deere’s customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to john deere in addition credit market dislocations including as a result of eurozone concerns could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to john deere’s financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates in addition changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the company’s net interest income and earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

  

john deere’s operations are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over john deere’s international operations in addition private civil litigation on these subjects has increased primarily in the us 

  

enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict john deere’s operations require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability there can be no assurance that violations of such legislation andor regulations or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deere’s operations would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deere’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

  

john deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards including usepa interim tier 4 final tier 4 and eu stage iiib and stage iv nonroad diesel emission requirements these standards are applicable to many engines manufactured by john deere and used in many models of john deere agricultural and construction and forestry equipment in order to meet these standards john deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that 

  

  

would prevent timely compliance these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results 

  

john deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities suppliers and customers 

  

there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases “ghg” continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations may lead to international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deere’s operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs the regulation of ghg emissions from nonroad sources could require further changes to the design of john deere’s engines and equipment increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future ghg legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of the mandates or standards john deere is unable to predict its significance at this time 

  

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deere’s facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include changes in weather patterns including drought and rainfall levels water availability storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels these potential physical effects may adversely impact the demand for john deere’s products and the cost production sales and financial performance of john deere’s operations 

  

sustained increases in funding obligations under the company’s pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition 

  

the company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees which impose on us funding obligations the company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under the plans significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of returns being lower than expected the company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future these factors could significantly increase the company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the reallocation of radio frequency rf spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of john deere’s high precision augmented global positioning system gps technology which could impair john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability 

  

john deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment depend upon the use of rf signals these signals include but are not limited to gps signals other gpslike satellite signals augmented gps services and other rf equipment which link equipment operations owners dealers and technicians these radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national agencies any international or national reallocation of frequency bands including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of john deere’s gpsbased products which could negatively affect john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions for john deere’s agricultural customers the inability to use highprecision augmented gps signals or other rf signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance seed fertilizer fuel and wage costs for construction customers disrupting gps or rf applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies these cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for john deere products 

  

security breaches and other disruptions to john deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with john deere’s operations and could compromise john deere’s and its customers’ and suppliers’ information exposing john deere to liability which would cause john deere’s business and reputation to suffer 

  

in the ordinary course of business john deere relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of john deere equipment and from customers of john deere’s financial services operations john deere uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally john deere collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information the proprietary business information of our customers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of john deere’s customers and employees in data centers and on information 

  

  

technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to john deere’s business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans john deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise john deere’s networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage john deere’s reputation which could adversely affect john deere’s business

market conditions and outlook 

  

in spite of an unsettled global economy demand for the company’s products is expected to experience substantial growth in fiscal year 2012 and the company is forecasting further increases in sales and earnings as a result company equipment sales are projected to increase about 15 percent for the year and 16 to 18 percent for the first quarter compared with the same periods of 2011 included is a favorable currency translation impact of about 3 percent for the first quarter and about 1 percent for the year net income attributable to deere  company for the year is anticipated to be approximately 32 billion 

  

agriculture  turf worldwide sales of the company’s agriculture and turf segment are forecast to increase by about 15 percent for fiscal year 2012 with a favorable currency translation impact of about 1 percent farmers in the world’s major markets are continuing to experience favorable incomes due to strong demand for agricultural commodities the company’s sales are expected to benefit as well from advanced new products being launched throughout the world and major expansion projects such as those in emerging markets 

  

  

industry farm machinery sales in the united states us and canada are forecast to increase 5 to 10 percent in 2012 following an increase in 2011 overall conditions remain positive and demand continues to be strong especially for high horsepower equipment 

  

industry sales in the eu 27 nations of western and central europe are forecast to be approximately the same for 2012 as a result of general economic concerns in the region sales in the commonwealth of independent states are expected to be moderately higher after rising substantially in 2011 sales in asia are forecast to increase strongly again in 2012 in south america industry sales for the year are projected to be about the same as the strong levels of 2011 

  

industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the us and canada are expected to increase slightly in 2012 

  

construction  forestry worldwide sales of the company’s construction and forestry equipment are forecast to grow by about 16 percent for fiscal year 2012 with a favorable currency translation impact of about 1 percent the increase reflects slightly improved market conditions and improved activity outside of the us including strength in canada construction equipment sales to independent rental companies are expected to see further gains the company’s sales also are expected to be supported by a range of advanced new products and by geographic expansion after considerable growth in 2011 world forestry markets are projected to be about the same in 2012 due to weaker economic conditions in europe 

  

financial services fiscal year 2012 net income attributable to deere  company for the financial services operations is expected to be approximately 450 million the forecast decline from 2011 is primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses which is anticipated to return to a more typical level as well as higher selling administrative and general expenses in support of enterprise growth initiatives partially offsetting these items is expected growth in the credit portfolio 

  

2011 consolidated results compared with 2010 

  

worldwide net income attributable to deere  company in 2011 was 2800 million or 663 per share diluted 671 basic compared with 1865 million or 435 per share diluted 440 basic in 2010 net sales and revenues increased 23 percent to 32013 million in 2011 compared with 26005 million in 2010 net sales of the equipment operations increased 25 percent in 2011 to 29466 million from 23573 million last year the sales increase which was primarily due to higher shipment volumes also included a favorable effect for foreign currency translation of 3 percent and price realization of 3 percent net sales in the us and canada increased 17 percent in 2011 net sales outside the us and canada increased by 38 percent in 2011 which included a favorable effect of 7 percent for foreign currency translation 

  

worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of 3839 million in 2011 compared with 2909 million in 2010 the higher operating profit was primarily due to higher shipment volumes and improved price realization partially offset by increased raw material costs higher manufacturing overhead costs related to new products higher selling administrative and general expenses and increased research and development expenses 

  

the equipment operations’ net income was 2329 million in 2011 compared with 1492 million in 2010 the same operating factors mentioned above and a lower effective tax rate in 2011 affected these results 

  

net income of the financial services operations attributable to deere  company in 2011 increased to 471 million compared with 373 million in 2010 the increase was primarily a result of growth in the credit portfolio and a lower provision for credit losses additional information is presented in the discussion of the “worldwide financial services operations” on page 20 

  

the cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2011 was 744 percent compared with 738 percent last year the increase was primarily due to increased raw material costs and higher manufacturing overhead costs related to new products partially offset by improved price realization 

  

additional information on 2011 results is presented on pages 19  20 

  

equipment operations 

  

agriculture and turf 

  

the john deere agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes a full line of agricultural and turf equipment and related service parts the segment’s global operating model is designed to enable faster geographic growth and increase the segment’s competitiveness pursuant to this model the segment consolidates all markets into four geographical customer focus areas to facilitate comprehensive customer understanding and deliver optimal customer service as an additional component of the global operating model the segment’s equipment operations are consolidated into five product platforms — crop harvesting combines corn pickers

sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and governmental policies including the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels and access to financing interest and exchange rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels labor availability and costs energy costs and other input costs associated with farming other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers 

  

innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the us and canada and a growing proportion of sales in many countries outside the us and canada is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters selfpropelled sprayers and seeding equipment however as john deere expands its business globally especially in developing countries where demand for smaller equipment is greater john deere’s sales of small tractors below 100 horsepower are increasing and john deere offers a number of harvesting solutions to support the development of mechanized harvesting of grain oilseeds cotton sugar and biomass 

  

retail sales of lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors residential and commercial mowers utility vehicles and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions 

  

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment john deere offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural equipment the segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during offseason periods in australia canada and the us there are typically several used equipment tradein transactions for most new agricultural equipment sales to provide support to the company’s dealers for these used equipment tradeins john deere provides dealers in these countries with a pool of funds awarded to dealers as a percentage of the dealer cost for certain new eligible equipment sales dealers can use these funds to defray the costs of carrying or marketing used equipment inventory or to provide financing incentives to customers purchasing the used equipment 

  

  

retail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third quarters john deere is pursuing a strategy of building and shipping as close to retail demand as possible consequently to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year production and shipment schedules of these product lines will normally be proportionately higher in the second and third quarters of each year corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales

environmental matters 

  

john deere is subject to a wide variety of local state and federal environmental laws and regulations in the us as well as the environmental laws and regulations of other countries in which john deere conducts business john deere strives to comply and believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations however failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties john deere is involved in the evaluation and cleanup of a limited number of sites but does not expect that these matters or other expenses or liabilities john deere may incur in connection with any noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations or the cleanup of any additional properties will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position results of operations cash flows or competitive position of the company with respect to acquired properties and businesses or properties and businesses acquired in the future john deere conducts due diligence into potential exposure to environmental liabilities but cannot be certain that it has identified or will identify all adverse environmental conditions compliance with these laws and regulations has added and will continue to add to the cost of john deere products 

  

the us environmental protection agency has issued increasingly stringent regulations concerning permissible emissions of offroad engines and governmental agencies throughout the world are similarly enacting more stringent laws to reduce offroad engine emissions john deere has achieved and plans to continue to achieve compliance with these regulations through significant investments in the development of new engine technologies and aftertreatment systems compliance with emissions regulations has added and will continue to add to the cost of john deere’s products

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

the following risks are considered the most significant to john deere’s business based upon current knowledge information and assumptions this discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis beginning on page 19 and specifically the risks and uncertainties described in the safe harbor statement on pages 21 and 22 these risk factors and other forwardlooking statements that relate to future events expectations trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business while others could affect all of the company’s businesses although each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated the company except as required by law undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion 

  

international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deere’s profitability and growth prospects  

  

international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting trade including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deere’s multinational business john deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis while trade agreements may expand opportunities trade restrictions could limit john deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services furthermore the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to john deere’s agricultural and forestry customers policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities including the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the world trade organization could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities which may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure furthermore changes in government farm program and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment 

  

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

  

policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity andor stabilize financial markets may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deere’s customers and markets john deere’s operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform which could have an adverse affect on the financial services segment and john deere’s customers by limiting their ability to finance purchases of john deere products governmental policies on taxes and spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development 

  

changing worldwide demand for food and for different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements 

  

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment while higher commodity prices will benefit john deere’s crop producing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing biofuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect demand for john deere’s gasoline or dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

  

  

as john deere seeks to expand its business globally growth opportunities may be impacted by greater political economic and social uncertainty and the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deere’s competition customer base and product offerings 

  

john deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to brazil china india and russia in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deere’s other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation and repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the company’s financial results as these emerging geographic markets become more important to john deere its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and the john deere brand is widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brand is less well known in some emerging markets which could impede john deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances john deere’s reputation andor business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful 

  

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere’s equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

  

the demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment cautious consumer spending lower corporate earnings and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions causing john deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their propensity to purchase john deere’s equipment sustained or negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry segment are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions sustained low levels or decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deere’s agricultural equipment sales in addition negative or uncertain economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in capital market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows additionally the company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings 

  

concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro the potential reintroduction of individual currencies within the eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely could adversely affect john deere’s business results of operations and financing 

  

as a result of the debt crisis with respect to countries in europe in particular most recently in greece italy ireland portugal and spain the european commission created the european financial stability facility the “efsf” and the european financial stability mechanism the “efsm” to provide funding to countries using the euro as their currency the “eurozone” that are in financial difficulty and seek such support 

  

in march 2011 the european council agreed on the need for eurozone countries to establish a permanent financial stability mechanism the european stability mechanism the “esm” which will be activated by mutual agreement to assume the role of the efsf and the efsm in providing external financial assistance to eurozone countries after june 2013 despite these measures concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 

  

these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro dissolve entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the company’s euro denominated assets and obligations in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally and more specifically on the ability of the company and john deere’s customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for john deere products 

  

  

the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency translation risk 

  

the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s results 

  

because the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere sales worldwide john deere’s operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry 

  

in recent years negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere’s sales worldwide the financial services segment’s inability to access funds or to access funds at cost effective rates to support its financing activities to john deere’s customers could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s business the financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the financial services segment’s writeoffs and provisions for credit losses 

  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act act and the regulations implementing the act could impose additional supervisory financial and reporting requirements and compliance costs on the company and the company’s financial services operations and could therefore adversely affect the company and its financial services segment 

  

the act was enacted on july 21 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry including equipment financing and securitizations the act directs federal agencies including the consumer financial protection bureau the federal reserve the commodity futures trading commission the federal deposit insurance corporation and others to adopt rules to regulate depository institutions nonbank financial institutions thrift holding companies the consumer finance industry and the capital markets including certain commercial transactions such as derivatives contracts although the effects of the act on the capital markets and the financial industry are largely unknown until regulations have been finalized and implemented the act and its regulations could impose additional reporting requirements leverage capital and other supervisory and financial standards and restrictions that increase regulatoryrelated compliance costs for the company and the company’s financial services operations and could adversely affect the company and its financial services segment’s funding activities liquidity structure including relationships with affiliates operations and performance 

  

john deere’s business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand 

  

john deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in potential high growth markets including brazil china india and russia failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deere’s business 

  

john deere’s business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agricultural and turf equipment 

  

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deere’s customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can also prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth crop maturity and crop quality natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment sales of turf equipment particularly during the important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather adverse weather 

  

  

conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

  

changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods could result in production disruptions or increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products  

  

john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products changes in the availability and price of these raw materials components and whole goods which have fluctuated significantly in the past and which are more likely to occur during times of economic volatility can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business particularly if john deere due to pricing considerations or other factors was unable to recover the increased costs from its customers supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial viability capacity constraints business continuity quality delivery or disruptions due to weather related or natural disaster events could similarly affect john deere’s operations and profitability 

  

john deere’s equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

  

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deere’s customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to john deere in addition credit market dislocations including as a result of eurozone concerns could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to the company’s financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates in addition changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the company’s net interest income and earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

  

john deere’s operations are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over john deere’s international operations in addition private civil litigation on these subjects has increased primarily in the us 

  

enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict john deere’s operations require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability there can be no assurance that violations of such legislation andor regulations or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deere’s operations would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deere’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

  

john deere’s equipment operations must meet new and increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards including interim tier 4 final tier 4 and stage iiib nonroad diesel emission requirements applicable to many engines manufactured by john deere and used in many models of john deere agricultural and construction and forestry equipment in order to meet these standards john deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs and is introducing many new equipment models largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results 

  

john deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities suppliers and customers 

  

there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases “ghg” continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations may lead to international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the near future various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile 

  

  

  

sources could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deere’s operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs the regulation of ghg emissions from nonroad sources could require further changes to the design of john deere’s engines and equipment increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future ghg legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of the mandates or standards john deere is unable to predict its significance at this time 

  

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deere’s facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include changes in weather patterns including drought and rainfall levels water availability storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels these potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost production sales and financial performance of john deere’s operations 

  

the reallocation of radio frequency spectrums could disrupt or degrade the reliability of john deere’s high precision augmented global positioning system gps technology which could impair john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability 

  

john deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment depend upon the use of gps signals and augmented gps services which link equipment operations owners dealers and technicians these services depend on satellite and radio frequency allocations governed by international and local agencies any international or local reallocation of radio frequency bands including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing or other modifications of the permitted uses of frequency bands could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of john deere’s gpsbased products which could negatively affect john deere’s ability to develop and market gpsbased technology solutions for john deere’s agricultural customers the inability to use highprecision augmented gps services could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance seed fertilizer fuel and wage costs for construction customers disrupting gps applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies these cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for john deere products 

  

security breaches and other disruptions to the company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the company’s operations and could compromise the company’s and its customers’ and suppliers’ information exposing the company to liability which would cause the company’s business and reputation to suffer 

  

in the ordinary course of business the company relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including supply chain manufacturing distribution invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of john deere equipment and from customers of the company’s financial services operations the company uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally the company collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information the propriety business information of our customers and suppliers as well as personally identifiable information of the company’s customers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to the company’s business operations and strategy despite security measures and business continuity plans the company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise the company’s networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage the company’s reputation which could adversely affect the company’s business

products 

  

deere  company the company and its subsidiaries collectively called john deere have operations which are categorized into three major business segments 

  

the agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm and turf equipment and related service parts — including large medium and utility tractors loaders combines cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related frontend equipment and sugarcane loaders tillage seeding and application equipment including sprayers nutrient management and soil preparation machinery hay and forage equipment including selfpropelled forage harvesters and attachments balers and mowers turf and utility equipment including riding lawn equipment and walkbehind mowers golf course equipment utility vehicles and commercial mowing equipment along with a broad line of associated implements integrated agricultural management systems technology precision agricultural irrigation equipment and supplies landscape and nursery products and other outdoor power products 

  

the construction and forestry segment manufactures distributes to dealers and sells at retail a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction earthmoving material handling and timber harvesting — including backhoe loaders crawler dozers and loaders fourwheeldrive loaders excavators motor graders articulated dump trucks landscape loaders skidsteer loaders and log skidders feller bunchers log loaders log forwarders log harvesters and related attachments 

  

the products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets 

  

the credit segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment in addition the credit segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment provides operating loans finances retail revolving charge accounts offers crop risk mitigation products and held residual wind energy generation investments until december 2010 see note 30 

  

john deere’s worldwide agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations are sometimes referred to as the “equipment operations” the credit and certain miscellaneous service operations are sometimes referred to as “financial services” 

  

additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on page 21 the john deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837 the present company was incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1958 

  

the company’s internet address is httpwwwjohndeerecom through that address the company’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the united states securities and exchange commission “securities and exchange commission” or “commission” the information contained on the company’s website is not included in or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

  

market conditions and outlook 

  

the company’s equipment sales are projected to increase 10 to 12 percent for fiscal year 2011 and increase about 34 percent for the first quarter compared with the same periods in 2010 included is an unfavorable currency translation impact of about 1 percent for the year and about 2 percent for the first quarter of 2011 net income attributable to deere  company is anticipated to be approximately 21 billion for 2011 

  

fiscal year 2011 will be a record year for new model introductions for john deere due in large part to the implementation of more rigorous global engine emissions standards the company’s earnings forecast reflects the complexity of transitioning to these new equipment models as well as increased product costs to comply with the regulations in addition the company projects higher raw material costs in 2011 and a less favorable sales mix in the agriculture and turf segment 

  

  

agriculture and turf worldwide sales of the company’s agriculture and turf segment are forecast to increase by 7 to 9 percent for fiscal year 2011 benefiting from generally favorable global farm conditions farmers in most of the company’s key markets are experiencing solid levels of income due to strong global demand for agricultural commodities low grain stockpiles in relation to use and high prices for crops such as corn wheat soybeans sugar and cotton 

  

after increasing in 2010 industry farm machinery sales in the united states us and canada are forecast to be about the same in 2011 as a result of production limits and transitional issues associated with the broad launch of interim tier 4 compliant equipment 

  

industry sales in western europe are forecast to increase 5 to 10 percent while sales in central europe and the commonwealth of independent states are expected to see moderate gains from the depressed level in 2010 industry sales in asia also are forecast to grow moderately 

  

in south america industry sales are projected to be about the same in 2011 relative to the strong levels of 2010 although the company’s sales in the region are expected to benefit from a broader lineup of recently introduced products 

  

industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the us and canada are expected to be approximately the same after experiencing some recovery in 2010 

  

construction and forestry worldwide sales of john deere’s construction and forestry equipment are forecast to rise by 25 to 30 percent for fiscal year 2011 the increase reflects market conditions that are somewhat improved in relation to the relatively low level in 2010 in addition sales to independent rental companies are expected to see further growth world forestry markets are expected to move significantly higher as a result of improved wood and pulp prices 

  

credit net income in fiscal year 2011 for john deere’s credit operations is forecast to be approximately 360 million the forecast increase from 2010 primarily is due to growth in the portfolio 

  

2010 consolidated results compared with 2009 

  

worldwide net income attributable to deere  company in 2010 was 1865 million or 435 per share diluted 440 basic compared with 873 million or 206 per share diluted 207 basic in 2009 included in net income for 2009 were charges of 381 million pretax 332 million aftertax or 78 per share diluted and basic related to impairment of goodwill and voluntary employee separation expenses see note 5 net sales and revenues increased 13 percent to 26005 million in 2010 compared with 23112 million in 2009 net sales of the equipment operations increased 14 percent in 2010 to 23573 million from 20756 million last year the sales increase was primarily due to higher shipment volumes the increase also included a favorable effect for foreign currency translation of 3 percent and a price increase of 2 percent net sales in the us and canada increased 14 percent in 2010 net sales outside the us and canada increased by 14 percent in 2010 which included a favorable effect of 5 percent for foreign currency translation 

  

worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of 2909 million in 2010 compared with 1365 million in 2009 the higher operating profit was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes improved price realization the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange and lower raw material costs partially offset by increased postretirement costs and higher incentive compensation expenses last year was also affected by a goodwill impairment charge and voluntary employee separation expenses 

  

the equipment operations’ net income including noncontrolling interests was 1492 million in 2010 compared with 677 million in 2009 the same operating factors mentioned above affected these results 

  

net income of the company’s financial services operations attributable to deere  company in 2010 increased to 373 million compared with 203 million in 2009 the increase was primarily a result of improved financing spreads and a lower provision for credit losses additional information is presented in the discussion of the “worldwide credit operations” on page 21 

  

  

the cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2010 was 738 percent compared with 783 percent last year the decrease was primarily due to higher shipment and production volumes improved price realization favorable effects of foreign currency exchange and lower raw material costs a larger goodwill impairment charge and voluntary employee separation expenses also affected last year’s ratio 

  

additional information on 2010 results is presented on pages 20  21 

  

equipment operations 

  

agriculture and turf 

  

the john deere agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes a full line of agricultural and turf equipment and related service parts the segment’s global operating model is designed to enable faster geographic growth and increase the segment’s competitiveness pursuant to this model the segment consolidates all markets into four customer focus areas to facilitate comprehensive customer understanding and deliver optimal customer service as an additional component of the global operating model the segment’s equipment operations are consolidated into five product platforms — crop harvesting combines cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related frontend equipment and sugarcane loaders turf and utility utility vehicles riding lawn equipment walk behind mowers commercial mowing equipment golf course equipment implements for mowing tilling snow and debris handling aerating and many other residential commercial golf and sports turf care applications and other outdoor power products hay and forage selfpropelled forage harvesters and attachments balers and mowers crop care tillage seeding and application equipment including sprayers nutrient management and soil preparation machinery and tractors loaders and large medium and utility tractors john deere also purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale additionally the segment offers ancillary products and services supporting its agricultural and turf equipment customers john deere landscapes a unit of the segment distributes irrigation equipment nursery products and landscape supplies including seed fertilizer and hardscape materials primarily to landscape service professionals john deere water also a unit of the agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes precision agricultural irrigation equipment and supplies 

  

the segment also provides integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems john deere has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced communications data collection and global satellite positioning technologies to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields improve soil conservation and minimize chemical use and to gather information recently introduced advanced telematics systems remotely connect agricultural equipment owners business managers and dealers to agricultural equipment in the field providing realtime alerts and information about equipment location utilization performance and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency 

  

in addition to the john deere brand the agriculture and turf segment manufactures and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the frontier brand name walkbehind mowers and scarifiers in europe under the sabo brand name and tractors in china under the benye brand name john deere manufactures its agricultural and turf equipment for sale primarily through independent retail dealer networks and also builds products for sale by mass retailers including the home depot and lowe’s 

  

sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and governmental policies including the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels and access to financing interest and exchange rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels energy costs and other input costs associated with farming other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers 

  

innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the us and canada and a growing proportion of sales in many countries outside the us and canada is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters selfpropelled 

  

  

sprayers and seeding equipment however as john deere expands its business globally especially in developing countries where demand for smaller equipment is greater john deere’s sales of tractors below 100 horsepower have increased 

  

retail sales of lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors residential and commercial mowers utility vehicles and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions 

  

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment john deere offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural equipment the segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during offseason periods in the us and canada there are typically several used equipment tradein transactions for most new agricultural equipment sales to provide support to the company’s dealers for these used equipment tradeins john deere provides dealers with a pool of funds awarded to dealers as a percentage of the dealer cost for certain new eligible equipment sales dealers can use these funds to defray the costs of carrying or marketing used equipment inventory or to provide financing incentives to customers purchasing the used equipment 

  

retail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third quarters john deere is pursuing a strategy of building and shipping as close to retail demand as possible consequently to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year production and shipment schedules of these product lines will normally be proportionately higher in the second and third quarters of each year corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales 

  

construction and forestry 

  

john deere construction earthmoving material handling and forestry equipment includes a broad range of backhoe loaders crawler dozers and loaders fourwheeldrive loaders excavators motor graders articulated dump trucks landscape loaders skidsteer loaders log skidders log feller bunchers log loaders log forwarders log harvesters and a variety of attachments john deere provides the most complete line of forestry machines and attachments available in the world the segment’s forestry machines are distributed under the john deere brand name and forestry attachments are distributed under the john deere and waratah brand names in addition to the equipment manufactured by the construction and forestry segment john deere purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale the segment also provides comprehensive fleet management telematics solutions designed to improve customer productivity and efficiency through access to fleet location utilization and maintenance information 

  

the prevailing levels of residential commercial and public construction and the condition of the forest products industry influence retail sales of john deere construction earthmoving material handling and forestry equipment general economic conditions the level of interest rates the availability of credit and certain commodity prices such as those applicable to pulp paper and saw logs also influence sales

backlog orders 

  

the dollar amount of backlog orders for the agriculture and turf segment believed to be firm was approximately 43 billion at october 31 2010 compared with 36 billion at october 31 2009 the agriculture and turf backlog is generally highest in the second and third quarters due to seasonal buying trends in these industries john deere generally produces and ships its construction and forestry equipment on average within approximately 60 days after 

  

  

an order is deemed to become firm therefore no significant amount of construction and forestry backlog orders accumulates during any period 

  

trade accounts and notes receivable 

  

trade accounts and notes receivable arise primarily from sales of goods to independent dealers most trade receivables originated by the equipment operations are purchased by financial services the equipment operations compensate financial services at market rates of interest for these receivables additional information appears in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

financial services 

  

credit operations 

  

us and canada  the company’s credit segment collectively referred to as the credit companies primarily provide and administer financing for retail purchases from john deere dealers of new equipment manufactured by the company’s agriculture and turf and construction and forestry divisions and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment in the us certain subsidiaries included in the credit segment also offer crop risk mitigation products 

  

the company and john deere construction  forestry company are referred to as the “sales companies” john deere capital corporation capital corporation a us credit subsidiary generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts retail notes from the sales companies these retail notes are acquired by the sales companies through john deere retail dealers in the us john deere credit inc a canadian credit subsidiary purchases and finances retail notes acquired by john deere limited the company’s canadian sales branch the terms of retail notes and the basis on which the credit companies acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by agreements with the sales companies the credit companies also finance and service revolving charge accounts in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets revolving charge accounts further the credit companies finance and service operating loans in most cases offered through and acquired from farm input providers or through direct relationships with agricultural producers or agribusinesses operating loans additionally the credit companies provide wholesale financing for inventories of john deere agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment owned by dealers of those products wholesale notes the various financing options offered by the credit companies are designed to enhance sales of john deere products and generate financing income for the credit companies 

  

retail notes acquired by the sales companies are immediately sold to the credit companies the equipment operations are the credit companies’ major source of business but many retail purchasers of john deere products finance their purchases outside the john deere organization through a variety of sources including commercial banks and finance and leasing companies 

  

the credit companies offer retail leases to equipment users in the us a small number of leases are executed with units of local government leases are usually written for periods of two to five years and typically contain an option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term retail leases are also offered in a generally similar manner to customers in canada through john deere credit inc and john deere limited 

  

the credit companies’ terms for financing equipment retail sales other than smaller items financed with unsecured revolving charge accounts provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed the credit companies’ guidelines for minimum down payments which vary with the types of equipment and repayment provisions are generally not less than 20 percent on agricultural equipment 10 percent on construction and forestry equipment and 10 percent on turf care equipment used for personal use finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain john deere products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions the credit companies generally receive compensation from the sales companies equal to a competitive interest rate for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases the cost is accounted for as a deduction in arriving at net sales by the equipment operations 

  

the company has an agreement with capital corporation to make income maintenance payments to capital corporation such that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 105 to 1 for any fiscal quarter for 2010 and 2009 capital corporation’s ratios were 189 to 1 and 128 to 1 respectively and never less than 161 to 1 and 

  

  

112 to 1 for any fiscal quarter of 2010 and 2009 respectively the company has also committed to continue to own at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of capital corporation and to maintain capital corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than 50 million the company’s obligations to make payments to capital corporation under the agreement are independent of whether capital corporation is in default on its indebtedness obligations or other liabilities further the company’s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of capital corporation’s indebtedness obligations or other liabilities the company’s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness obligation or liability of capital corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of capital corporation no payments were required under this agreement in 2010 or 2009 

  

outside the us and canada  the credit companies also offer financing primarily for john deere products in australia new zealand russia and in several countries in europe and in latin america in certain areas financing is offered through cooperation agreements or joint ventures financing outside of the us and canada is affected by a variety of customs and regulations 

  

the credit companies also offer to select customers and dealers credit enhanced international export financing for the purchase of john deere products 

  

capital expenditures  the credit operations’ capital expenditures cost reductions totaled 1 million in 2010 compared with 5 million in 2009 and 337 million in 2008 the capital expenditures for 2010 and 2009 were more than offset by cost reductions due to becoming eligible for government grants for certain wind energy investments related to costs recognized in prior and current periods provisions for depreciation applicable to these operations’ property and equipment during these years were 64 million 62 million and 34 million respectively capital expenditures for the credit operations in 2011 are not expected to be significant the company sold the wind energy business for approximately 900 million after year end see notes 4 and 30 

  

additional information on the credit companies appears on pages 21 22 24 26 and 27 

  

environmental matters 

  

john deere is subject to a wide variety of state federal and international environmental laws rules and regulations these laws rules and regulations may affect the way john deere conducts its operations and failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties john deere is also involved in the evaluation and cleanup of a limited number of sites management does not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows of the company with respect to acquired properties and businesses john deere cannot be certain that it has identified all adverse environmental conditions john deere expects that it will acquire additional properties and businesses in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following risks are considered the most significant to john deere’s business based upon current knowledge information and assumptions this discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis beginning on page 20 and specifically the risks and uncertainties described in the safe harbor statement on pages 22 and 23 

  

international regional and national trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impact john deere’s profitability and growth prospects  

  

international regional and national laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting trade including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deere’s multinational business john deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace open access to global markets improves john deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and affects the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions could limit john deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services furthermore the ability to export commodities is critical to john deere’s agricultural and forestry customers policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities including the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the world trade organization could have a material effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities which may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially affected because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world 

  

trade restrictions could also impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure 

  

changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on john deere 

  

changes in policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies to promote liquidity and increase the availability of credit may not be effective and could have a material impact on john deere’s customers and markets john deere’s operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform which could have an adverse affect on the credit segment andor john deere’s customers by limiting their ability to finance purchases of john deere products governmental policies on taxes and spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development 

  

changing worldwide demand for food and for different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements 

  

changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment while higher commodity prices may benefit john deere’s crop producing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by those customers furthermore changing biofuel demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect demand for john deere’s gasoline or dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards 

  

  

as john deere seeks to expand its business globally growth opportunities may be impacted by the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses which could significantly change the dynamics of john deere’s competition customer base and product offerings 

  

john deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent upon access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to brazil russia india and china in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than john deere’s other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change increased exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect the company’s financial results and differing local customer product preferences and product requirements as these emerging geographic markets become more important to john deere its competitors are seeking to expand their production capacities in these same markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances particularly by focusing on gaining customer understanding in highgrowth potential emerging markets john deere’s business efforts could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful 

  

negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deere’s equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs 

  

the demand for john deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment lower consumer spending lower corporate earnings and lower business investment significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows the company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings general economic conditions can affect the demand for john deere’s equipment sustained or severe negative economic conditions and outlook resulting in decreased housing starts and other construction can dampen demand for certain construction equipment john deere’s turf operations and construction and forestry segment are dependent on construction activity and positive general economic conditions significant or prolonged declines in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations if negative economic conditions extend to the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on agricultural equipment sales 

  

the company’s consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency translation risk 

  

the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s results 

  

because the credit segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere sales worldwide john deere’s operations and financial results could be impacted materially should negative economic conditions affect the financial industry 

  

in recent years negative economic conditions have frequently had an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the credit segment operates the credit segment provides financing for a significant portion of john deere sales worldwide the credit segment’s inability to access funds to support its financing activities to john deere’s customers could have a material adverse effect on john deere’s business the credit segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally sustained negative market conditions could further reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the credit segment’s writeoffs and provisions for credit losses 

  

  

if john deere’s customers lack confidence in the general economic outlook they are less likely to purchase john deere’s products 

  

the attitudes of consumers about general economic conditions and outlook can significantly affect their propensity to purchase john deere equipment continuing or worsening negative economic conditions could significantly impair customer confidence and result in reduced equipment sales 

  

john deere’s business results depend largely on its ability to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand 

  

john deere’s ability to match its new product offerings to its customers’ anticipated preferences for enhanced technologies and different types and sizes of equipment is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis failure to deliver quality products at competitive prices to meet customer demands before competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deere’s business 

  

john deere’s business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for agricultural and turf equipment 

  

poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deere’s customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can also prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth crop maturity and crop quality natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms and droughts can have significant negative effects on agricultural production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment sales of turf care equipment particularly during the important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes 

  

changes in the availability and price of raw materials can result in increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products  

  

john deere requires access to various raw materials at competitive prices to manufacture its products changes in the availability and price of raw materials which are more likely to occur during times of economic volatility can significantly increase the costs of production which would have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business 

  

john deere’s equipment operations and credit segment are subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit the ability to access capital markets while increasing borrowing costs 

  

rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of john deere’s customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment andor customers’ ability to repay obligations to john deere in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to the company’s credit segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates in addition changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the company’s net interest income and earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position 

  

  

john deere’s operations are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over john deere’s international operations in addition private civil litigation on these subjects has increased primarily in the us 

  

enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigation and defense costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities could prevent or restrict john deere’s operations require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability there can be no assurance that violations of such legislation andor regulations or private civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deere’s operations would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deere’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

increasingly stringent engine emission standards could impact john deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment which could negatively affect business results 

  

beginning in 2011 john deere’s equipment operations must meet new and increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards including interim tier 4 and stage iiib nonroad diesel emission requirements applicable to many engines manufactured by john deere and used in many models of john deere agricultural and construction and forestry equipment in order to meet these standards john deere has incurred substantial research and development costs and in fiscal year 2011 will introduce a record number of new equipment models largely due to the implementation of these more rigorous standards while john deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee obstacles that would prevent timely compliance these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect john deere’s ability to distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results 

  

john deere may incur increased costs due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards designed to address climate change and could be further impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities suppliers and customers 

  

there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases “ghg” continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions these considerations may lead to international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the near future the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources could result in additional costs to john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deere’s operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs the regulation of ghg emissions from nonroad sources could require further changes to the design of john deere’s engines and equipment increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future ghg legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of the mandate or standard john deere is unable to predict its significance at this time 

  

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deere’s facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include changes in weather patterns including drought and rainfall levels water availability storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels these potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost production sales and financial performance of john deere’s operations

the products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets 

  

the credit segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment in addition it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment provides operating loans finances retail revolving charge accounts offers certain crop risk mitigation products and invests in wind energy generation 

  

john deere’s worldwide agriculture and turf operations and construction and forestry operations are sometimes referred to as the “equipment operations” the credit and certain miscellaneous service operations are sometimes referred to as “financial services” 

  

additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on pages 18 — 19 the john deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837 the present company was incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1958 

  

the company’s internet address is httpwwwjohndeerecom through that address the company’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the united states securities and exchange commission “securities and exchange commission” or “commission” the information contained on the company’s website is not included in or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

  

market conditions and outlook 

  

company equipment sales are projected to be down about 1 percent for fiscal year 2010 and be down about 10 percent for the first quarter compared with the same periods a year ago this includes a favorable currencytranslation impact of about 1 percent for the year and about 3 percent for the quarter the company’s net income is anticipated to be approximately 900 million for 2010 mainly due to lower discount rates the company expects postretirement benefit costs to be about 400 million higher on a pretax basis in 2010 than in 2009 

  

agriculture and turf worldwide sales of the agriculture and turf segment are forecast to decrease by about 4 percent for the fiscal year 2010 including a favorable currency translation impact of about 2 percent on an industry basis farmmachinery sales in the us and canada are forecast to be down about 10 percent for the year cash receipts and commodity prices while below their prior peaks are anticipated to remain at healthy levels however farmers are expected to be cautious in their purchasing decisions as a result of negative overall economic conditions and near term profitability issues in the livestock and dairy sectors 

  

  

in other parts of the world industry farm machinery sales in western europe are forecast to decline 10 to 15 percent for the year mainly due to weakness in the livestock dairy and grain sectors sales in central europe and the commonwealth of independent states are expected to remain under pressure partly as a result of weak general economic conditions including low levels of available credit in south america industry sales are projected to increase by 10 to 15 percent in 2010 among other positive factors parts of south america are benefiting from a return to more normal weather patterns after last year’s severe drought the brazilian market is expected to receive support from good incomes for soybean and sugarcane producers and the continued availability of attractive government supported financing the forecast assumes that the brazilian currency does not strengthen further against the us dollar industry sales of turf equipment and compact utility tractors in the us and canada are expected to be flat for the year as a result of negative us economic conditions 

  

construction and forestry the company’s worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to increase by about 18 percent in 2010 sales are expected to be helped by aggressive inventory reductions in the previous year that position the company to align production with retail demand despite an increase in housing starts from historically low levels us construction equipment markets are forecast to be down for the year resulting from a decline in nonresidential construction activity and lower used equipment values global forestry markets are expected to experience some recovery based on higher demand for pulp and paper driven by higher worldwide economic output as well as the expected increase in us housing starts 

  

credit fullyear 2010 net income for the company’s credit operations is forecast to be approximately 240 million the forecast increase from 2009 primarily is due to higher commissions from crop insurance and increased revenue from wind energy projects 

  

2009 consolidated results compared with 2008 

  

worldwide net income in 2009 was 873 million or 206 per share diluted 207 basic compared with 2053 million or 470 per share diluted 476 basic in 2008 included in net income for 2009 were charges of 381 million pretax 332 million aftertax or 78 per share diluted and basic related to impairment of goodwill and voluntary employee separation expenses see note 5 net sales and revenues decreased 19 percent to 23112 million in 2009 compared with 28438 million in 2008 net sales of the equipment operations decreased 20 percent in 2009 to 20756 million from 25803 million last year the sales decrease was primarily due to lower shipment volumes the decrease also included an unfavorable effect for currency translation of 4 percent more than offset by price realization of 5 percent net sales in the us and canada decreased 14 percent in 2009 net sales outside the us and canada decreased by 28 percent which included an unfavorable effect of 8 percent for currency translation 

  

worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of 1365 million in 2009 compared with 2927 million in 2008 the deterioration in operating profit was primarily due to lower shipment and production volumes the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange a goodwill impairment charge higher raw material costs and voluntary employee separation expenses partially offset by improved price realization and lower selling administrative and general expenses 

  

the equipment operations’ net income was 678 million in 2009 compared with 1676 million in 2008 the same operating factors mentioned above in addition to a higher effective tax rate affected these results 

  

trade receivables and inventories at october 31 2009 were 5014 million compared with 6276 million last year or 24 percent of net sales in both years 

  

net income of the company’s financial services operations in 2009 decreased to 203 million compared with 337 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily a result of a higher provision for credit losses lower commissions from crop insurance narrower financing spreads and higher losses from construction equipment operating lease residual values partially offset by a lower effective tax rate primarily from wind energy tax credits and lower selling administrative and general expenses additional information is presented in the following discussion of the credit operations 

  

the cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2009 was 783 percent compared with 759 percent last year the increase was primarily due to lower shipment and production volumes unfavorable effects of foreign exchange a goodwill impairment charge higher raw material costs and voluntary employee separation expenses

equipment operations 

  

agriculture and turf 

  

the john deere agriculture and turf segment was created at the beginning of the third quarter of 2009 by combining the former agricultural equipment segment and the commercial and consumer equipment segment in order to achieve greater alignment and efficiency by leveraging common processes standards and resources combining these segments into a new agriculture and turf segment was one of the early components in the adoption of a new global operating model designed to enable geographic growth and increase competitiveness for the segment 

  

the agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes a full line of agricultural and turf equipment and related service parts as an additional component of the global operating model the segment is currently consolidating its equipment operations into five product platforms — including crop harvesting combines cotton and sugarcane harvesters and related frontend equipment and sugarcane loaders turf and utility utility vehicles riding lawn equipment walk behind mowers commercial mowing equipment golf course equipment implements for mowing tilling snow and debris handling aerating and many other residential commercial golf and sports turf care applications and other outdoor power products hay and forage selfpropelled forage harvesters and attachments balers and mowers crop care tillage seeding and application equipment including sprayers nutrient management and soil preparation machinery and tractors loaders and large medium and utility tractors the segment also provides integrated agricultural management systems technology and landscapes and nursery products 

  

in addition to the john deere brand the agriculture and turf segment also manufactures and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the frontier brand name walkbehind mowers and scarifiers in europe under the sabo brand name and tractors in china under the benye brand name the segment also builds products for sale by mass retailers including the home depot and lowe’s john deere landscapes a unit of the segment distributes irrigation equipment nursery products and landscape supplies including seed fertilizer and hardscape materials primarily to landscape service professionals john deere water a unit of the agriculture and turf segment manufactures and distributes precision agriculture irrigation equipment and supplies in 2008 john deere expanded its water technology business with the acquisitions of tsystems international inc and plastro irrigation systems ltd john deere also purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale 

  

sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and governmental policies including the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels and access to financing interest and exchange rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels energy costs and other input costs associated with farming other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers 

  

innovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment buying for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the united states and canada and a growing proportion of sales in many countries outside north america is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters selfpropelled sprayers and seeding equipment additionally as john deere expands its business globally especially in developing countries where demand for smaller equipment is greater john deere’s sales of tractors below 100 horsepower have increased the company has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced technology and global satellite positioning to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields improve soil conservation and minimize chemical use and to gather information 

  

retail sales of lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors residential and commercial mowers utility vehicles and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions 

  

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment the company offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural equipment the segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers 

  

  

who take delivery of machines during offseason periods in the united states and canada there are typically several used equipment tradein transactions for every new combine and cotton harvesting equipment sale to provide support to the company’s dealers for these used equipment tradeins the company provides dealers with a fixed pool of funds which can be used to either defray the costs of carrying used equipment inventory or to provide financing incentives to customers purchasing the used equipment  

  

retail demand for turf and utility equipment normally is higher in the second and third quarters john deere is pursuing a strategy of building and shipping as close to retail demand as possible consequently to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year production and shipment schedules of these product lines normally will be proportionately higher in the second and third quarters of each year corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales 

  

construction and forestry 

  

john deere construction earthmoving material handling and forestry equipment includes a broad range of backhoe loaders crawler dozers and loaders fourwheeldrive loaders excavators motor graders articulated dump trucks landscape loaders skidsteer loaders log skidders log feller bunchers log loaders log forwarders log harvesters and a variety of attachments this segment’s forestry machines and attachments are distributed under the john deere and waratah brand names in addition to the equipment manufactured by the construction and forestry segment john deere purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale 

  

the prevailing levels of residential commercial and public construction and the condition of the forest products industry influence retail sales of john deere construction earthmoving material handling and forestry equipment general economic conditions the level of interest rates availability of credit and certain commodity prices such as those applicable to pulp paper and saw logs also influence sales 

  

pursuant to agreements between john deere and bell equipment limited bell bell and deere collaborate to design articulated dump trucks which are manufactured by deere in the united states for john deere’s distribution under the deere trade name in north central and south america deere licenses bell to manufacture and sell certain deeredesigned construction equipment in specified territories of africa bell is also the distributor of certain deere manufactured construction equipment under the bell trade name and forestry equipment under the deere trade name in certain territories of africa

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend   

governmental actions  the company’s businesses are exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties related to the action or inaction of governmental bodies the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the world trade organization could have a material effect on the international flow of agricultural commodities which may result in a corresponding effect on the demand for agricultural equipment in many areas of the world the policies of the brazilian government including those related to exchange rates and commodity prices and argentine government could significantly change the dynamics of the agricultural economy in south america 

  

with respect to the ongoing global economic conditions changes in governmental banking monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase the availability of credit may not be effective and could have a material impact on the company’s customers and markets to the extent that the company participates in governmental programs designed to address current negative conditions both in the united states and in other countries there is no assurance such programs will remain available for sufficient periods of time or 

  

  

on acceptable terms to benefit the company and the expiration of such programs could have unintended adverse effects in addition certain competitors may be eligible for certain programs that the company is ineligible for which may create a competitive disadvantage the company’s operations and results could also be materially impacted by financial regulatory reform governmental policies on taxes and spending can also affect the company especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development 

  

changing demand for farm outputs  changing worldwide demand for food and the demand for different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on prices for farm commodities and consequently the demand for the company’s agricultural equipment in addition global economic conditions may have an impact on agricultural commodity prices 

  

impact of globalization  the continuing globalization of businesses may significantly change the dynamics of the company’s competition customer base and product offerings the company’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent on access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to brazil russia india and china in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes the company to multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change increased exposure to currency fluctuations differing local product preferences and product requirements differing labor regulations and differing tax laws simultaneously these emerging markets are becoming more important as their economies grow as other international companies grow globally and local low cost manufacturers expand their production capacities 

  

economic conditions and outlook  conditions in the global financial markets and general economy materially affect the company’s results of operations the demand for the company’s products and services could be adversely affected in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment lower consumer spending lower corporate earnings and lower business investment significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows the company’s investment management activities could be adversely impacted by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings general economic conditions can affect the demand for the company’s equipment current negative economic conditions and outlook have decreased housing starts and other construction and dampened demand for certain construction equipment the company’s turf operations and its construction and forestry segment are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions significant or prolonged declines in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations if continuing negative economic conditions extend to the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on agricultural equipment sales 

  

currency fluctuations  the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s results 

  

risks to financial services  current negative economic conditions have adversely affected the financial industry in which the credit segment operates the credit segment provides financing to a significant portion of john deere sales worldwide the credit segment’s inability to access funds to support its financing activities to the company’s customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the credit segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally continued negative market conditions could further reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the credit segment’s writeoffs and provisions for credit losses 

  

consumer attitudes  the confidence the company’s customers have in the general economic outlook can have a significant effect on their propensity to purchase equipment and consequently on the company’s sales continuing negative economic conditions could significantly impair customer confidence the company’s ability to match its new product offerings to its customers’ anticipated preferences for enhanced technologies and different types and sizes of equipment is important as well 

  

weather conditions poor or unusual weather conditions particularly in the spring can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of the company’s customers particularly the customers of the agriculture and turf segment sales of turf care equipment in the important spring selling season can be dramatically impacted by weather 

  

supply base and raw material costs  many of the company’s suppliers also supply the automotive industry the severe downturn in automotive sales and the weak financial condition and restructuring of some major automakers could cause these suppliers to face severe financial hardship and disrupt the company’s access to critical components changes in the availability and price of raw 

  

  

materials which are more likely to occur during times of economic volatility could have a material negative impact on the company’s costs of production and in turn on the profitability of the business 

  

interest rates and credit ratings  rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and could affect the demand for the company’s equipment in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to the company’s credit segment decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect the company’s returns as well 

  

environmental risk the company’s operations are subject to and affected by increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the company’s foreign operations violations of such laws or regulations can lead to investigation and remediation costs significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities and claims for damages to property or injury to persons resulting from the environmental health or safety impacts of the company’s operations or past contamination could prevent or restrict the company’s operations require significant expenditures to achieve compliance involve the imposition of cleanup liens andor give rise to civil or criminal liability there can be no assurance that violations of such legislation andor regulations which could result in enforcement actions or private claims would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations 

  

beginning in 2011 the company’s equipment operations must meet new and increasingly stringent engine emission standards including interim tier 4 and stage iiib nonroad diesel emission requirements applicable to many engines manufactured by the company and many models of john deere agricultural and construction and forestry equipment while the company has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and does not currently foresee obstacles that would prevent timely compliance these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or impact the company’s ability to distribute certain equipment or engines which could negatively impact business results 

  

climate change there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases “ghg” continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions there is growing consensus that some form of us regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances the impact of any future mandatory ghg legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on the company’s global businesses and products is dependent on the design of the mandate or standard and so the company is unable to predict its significance at this time 

  

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company’s customers and therefore on the company’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include changes in weather patterns including drought and rainfall levels water availability storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels these potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost production sales and financial performance of john deere’s operations 

  

the risks identified above should be considered in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis beginning on page 17 and specifically the other risks described in the safe harbor statement on pages 19 and 20 the company’s results of operations may be affected by these identified risks andor by risks not currently contemplated

the products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets 

  

the credit segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used agricultural commercial and consumer and construction and forestry equipment in addition it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment provides operating loans finances retail revolving charge accounts offers certain crop risk mitigation products and invests in wind energy generation 

  

john deere’s worldwide agricultural equipment commercial and consumer equipment and construction and forestry operations are sometimes referred to as the “equipment operations” the credit and certain miscellaneous service operations are sometimes referred to as “financial services” 

  

additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on page 16 the john deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837 the present company was incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1958

market conditions and outlook 

  

given the sudden sharp downturn in global economic activity and the ongoing turmoil in world financial markets the outlook for the year ahead is highly uncertain and its impact on the company’s operations is difficult to assess subject to the economic uncertainties company equipment sales are projected to be about flat for the full year of 2009 and up about 7 percent for the first quarter included in the forecast is a negative currencytranslation impact of about 6 percent for both the full year and first quarter john deere’s net income is forecast to be about 19 billion for 2009 and about 275 million for the first quarter 

  

agricultural equipment worldwide sales of the company’s agricultural equipment are forecast to increase by about 5 percent for fullyear 2009 this includes a negative currencytranslation impact of about 8 percent

  

farmmachinery industry sales in the united states and canada are forecast to be up about 5 percent for the year led by an increase in large tractors and combines the company expects agricultural commodity prices to remain at healthy levels in 2009 though below the previous year while costs moderate for key inputs such as fuel and fertilizer sales of cotton equipment small tractors and equipment commonly used by livestock producers are expected to be lower 

  

industry sales in western europe are forecast to be down 5 to 10 percent for the year sales are expected to be down moderately in central europe and the cis commonwealth of independent states countries including russia while demand in these areas for 

  

  

highly productive farm equipment remains good sales will depend on the availability and cost of credit sales in south american markets are expected to be down 10 to 20 percent in 2009 with the decline related to credit access in brazil and drought conditions in argentina 

  

commercial  consumer equipment reflecting the us housing market decline and recessionary economic conditions john deere commercial and consumer equipment sales are projected to be down about 6 percent for the year the segment expects sales gains from new products to partly offset the impact of the economic decline

  

construction  forestry us markets for construction and forestry equipment are forecast to remain under pressure due to further deterioration in the alreadyweakened housing sector a steep decline in nonresidential construction and negative economic growth the global economic slowdown is expected to lead to a lower level of forestry equipment sales in both the united states and europe subject to the economic uncertainties discussed earlier john deere’s worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to decline by approximately 12 percent for the year despite the poor economic climate company sales are expected to benefit from innovative new products

  

credit subject to the uncertainty associated with present economic conditions fullyear 2009 net income for john deere’s credit operations is forecast to be approximately 300 million the forecast decrease from 2008 is primarily due to narrower financing spreads related to the current funding environment

  

2008 consolidated results compared with 2007 

  

worldwide net income in 2008 was 2053 million or 470 per share diluted 476 basic compared with 1822 million or 400 per share diluted 405 basic in 2007 net sales and revenues increased 18 percent to 28438 million in 2008 compared with 24082 million in 2007 net sales of the equipment operations increased 20 percent in 2008 to 25803 million from 21489 million last year this included a positive effect for currency translation of 4 percent and price changes of 2 percent net sales in the us and canada increased 9 percent in 2008 net sales outside the us and canada increased by 40 percent which included a positive effect of 10 percent for currency translation 

  

worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of 2927 million in 2008 compared with 2318 million in 2007 higher operating profit was primarily due to the favorable impact of higher shipment volumes and improved price realization partially offsetting these factors were increased raw material costs higher selling administrative and general expenses increased research and development costs and expenses to close a facility in canada see note 3 

  

the equipment operations’ net income was 1676 million in 2008 compared with 1429 million in 2007 the same operating factors mentioned above as well as a higher effective tax rate this year affected these results 

  

net income of the company’s financial services operations in 2008 decreased to 337 million compared with 364 million in 2007 the decrease was primarily a result of increased selling administrative and general expenses an increase in average leverage and a higher provision for credit losses partially offset by growth in the average credit portfolio additional information is presented in the following discussion of the credit operations 

  

the cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2008 was 759 percent compared with 756 percent last year the increase was primarily due to higher raw material costs partially offset by higher sales and production volumes and improved price realization 

  

additional information on 2008 results is presented on pages 15 – 17 

  

equipment operations 

  

agricultural equipment 

  

the john deere worldwide agricultural equipment segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm equipment and related service parts including tractors combine cotton and sugar harvesting equipment tillage seeding nutrient management and soil preparation machinery sprayers hay and forage equipment material handling equipment integrated agricultural systems technology and precision agricultural irrigation equipment and supplies 

  

sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and governmental policies including the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels and access to financing interest and exchange rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels energy costs and other input costs associated with farming other important factors affecting new equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors 

  

  

harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers hay and forage equipment and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of equipment purchasers 

  

innovations in machinery and technology also influence buying for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations the company has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced technology and global satellite positioning to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields improve soil conservation and minimize chemical use and to gather information 

  

large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the united states and a growing proportion of sales outside north america is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters selfpropelled sprayers and seeding equipment 

  

the agricultural equipment segment also manufactures and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the frontier brand name as well as the john deere brand 

  

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment the company offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the agricultural equipment segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of equipment the agricultural equipment segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during offseason periods in the us and canada there are typically several used equipment tradein transactions for every new combine and cotton harvesting equipment sale to provide support to the company’s dealers for these used equipment tradeins the company provides dealers with a fixed pool of funds and the dealers are then responsible for all associated inventory and sale costs using these funds

  

an important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a diverse variety of shortline and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods because of industry conditions including the merger of certain large integrated competitors and the global capability and emergence of many competitors the agricultural equipment business continues to undergo significant change and may become even more competitive 

  

john deere water technologies a unit of the agricultural equipment segment manufactures and distributes precision irrigation products in 2008 john deere expanded its water technology business with the acquisitions of tsystems international inc and plastro irrigation systems ltd 

  

commercial and consumer equipment 

  

the john deere commercial and consumer segment includes lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors residential and commercial zeroturn radius mowers front mowers utility vehicles and golf and turf equipment a broad line of associated implements for mowing tilling snow and debris handling aerating and many other residential commercial golf and sports turf care applications are also included the product line also includes walkbehind mowers and other outdoor power products retail sales of these commercial and consumer equipment products are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year the production and shipment schedules of the commercial and consumer equipment segment’s product lines closely correspond to the seasonal pattern of retail sales 

  

the commercial and consumer segment manufactures and sells certain equipment attachments under the frontier brand name and manufactures and sells walkbehind mowers and scarifiers in europe under the sabo brand as well as the john deere brand the segment also builds products for sale by mass retailers including the home depot and lowe’s 

  

john deere landscapes inc a unit of the segment distributes irrigation equipment nursery products and landscape supplies including seed fertilizer and hardscape materials primarily to landscape service professionals in 2007 john deere acquired lesco inc expanding its customer base for these products 

  

in addition to the equipment manufactured by the commercial and consumer equipment segment john deere purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale 

  

seasonality retail demand for the segment’s equipment normally is higher in the second and third quarters the commercial and consumer equipment segment is pursuing a strategy of building and shipping as close to retail demand as possible consequently 

  

  

production shipping and retail sales normally will be proportionately higher in the second and third quarters of each year

 item 1a risk factors 

  

governmental actions  the company’s agricultural business is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties related to the action or inaction of governmental bodies the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the world trade organization could have a material effect on the international flow of agricultural commodities which may result in a corresponding effect on the demand for agricultural equipment in many areas of the world the policies of the brazilian government including those related to exchange rates and commodity prices and argentine government could significantly change the dynamics of the agricultural economy in south america with respect to the current global economic downturn changes in governmental banking monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase the availability of credit may not be effective and could have a material impact on the company’s customers and markets 

  

in addition to the extent that the company participates in governmental programs designed to address current conditions both in the us and outside the us there is no assurance such programs will remain available for sufficient periods of time or on acceptable terms to benefit the company and the expiration of such programs could have unintended adverse effects in addition certain competitors may be eligible for certain programs that the company is ineligible for which may create a competitive disadvantage 

  

the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 the “eesa” was signed into law on october 3 2008 to stabilize and provide liquidity to us financial markets there can be no assurance as to the actual impact of the implementing regulations of the eesa or any other governmental program on the financial markets the company’s business financial condition results of operations access to credit and trading price of common stock could be materially and adversely affected if the financial markets fail to stabilize or if current financial market conditions worsen 

  

  

the company may also become subject to additional restrictions pursuant to participation in the eesa’s specific programs for example john deere’s participation in the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program will require the payment of certain fees to the fdic the costs of participation or nonparticipation in any such program as well as the effect of such programs on the company’s results of operations cannot be reliably determined at this time 

  

changing demand for farm outputs  changing worldwide demand for food and the demand for different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on prices for farm commodities and consequently the demand for the company’s agricultural equipment in addition global economic conditions may have an impact on commodity prices

  

globalization  the continuing globalization of agricultural businesses may significantly change the dynamics of the company’s competition customer base and product offerings the company’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent on access to and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in additional geographic markets including but not limited to brazil russia india and china in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes the company to multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change increased exposure to currency fluctuations differing local product preferences and product requirements differing labor regulations and differing tax laws simultaneously these emerging markets are becoming more competitive as other international companies grow globally and local low cost manufacturers expand their production capacities

  

economic condition and outlook  recent significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows the company’s investment management operations could be adversely impacted by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings general economic conditions can affect the demand for the company’s equipment current negative economic conditions and outlook have decreased housing starts and other construction and dampened demand for certain construction equipment the company’s commercial and consumer equipment and construction and forestry segments are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions a significant or prolonged decline in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations if current economic difficulties as well as depressed housing markets continue into the foreseeable future if current economic conditions extend to the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on agricultural equipment sales 

  

the volatility in global financial markets has reached unprecedented levels global financial market downturns began in the second half of 2007 and significantly increased during the fourth quarter of 2008 volatile oil prices falling equity market values declining business weakened consumer confidence and risks of increased inflation and deflation and increased unemployment rates have created fears of a severe recession conditions in the global financial markets and general economy materially affect the company’s results of operations the demand for the company’s products and services could be adversely affected in an economic crisis characterized by higher unemployment lower consumer spending lower corporate earnings and lower business investment 

  

currency fluctuations  the reporting currency for the company’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a continuing and significant impact on the company’s results

  

risks to financial services segment  the current economic downturn and market volatility have adversely affected the financial industry in which the credit segment operates the credit segment provides financing to a significant portion of john deere sales worldwide the credit segment’s inability to access funds to support its financing activities to the company’s customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the credit segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and fund operations and the costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities in recent weeks the credit markets have reached unprecedented levels of volatility resulting in reduced levels of liquidity and disruption of domestic and foreign financial markets if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen funding could be unavailable or insufficient additionally under current market conditions customer confidence levels may result in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the credit segment’s writeoffs and provisions for credit losses 

  

consumer attitudes  the confidence the company’s customers have in the general economic outlook can have a significant effect on their propensity to purchase equipment and consequently on the company’s sales current negative economic conditions could significantly impair customer confidence the company’s ability to match its new product offerings to its customers’ anticipated preferences for enhanced technologies and different types and sizes of equipment is important as well

  

  

weather poor or unusual weather conditions particularly in the spring can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of the company’s customers particularly the customers of the agricultural and commercial and consumer segments sales in the important spring selling season can have a dramatic effect on the commercial and consumer segment’s financial results

  

supply base and raw material costs  many of the company’s suppliers also supply the automotive industry the severe downturn in automotive sales and the weak financial condition of some major automakers could cause these suppliers to face severe financial hardship and disrupt the company’s access to critical components changes in the availability and price of raw materials which are more likely to occur during times of economic volatility could have a material negative impact on the company’s costs of production and in turn on the profitability of the business

  

interest rates and credit ratings  if interest rates rise they could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and could affect the demand for the company’s equipment in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to the company’s credit segment decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect the company’s returns as well

  

environmental the company’s operations are subject to and affected by environmental health and safety laws and regulations by federal state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the company’s foreign operations violations of such laws or regulations can lead to investigation and remediation costs significant fines or penalties in addition increased requirements of governmental authorities and claims for damages to property or injury to persons resulting from the environmental health or safety impacts of the company’s operations or past contamination could prevent or restrict the company’s operations require significant expenditures to achieve compliance involve the imposition of cleanup liens andor give rise to civil or criminal liability there can be no assurance that violations of such legislation andor regulations which could result in enforcement actions or private claims would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations

  

climate change there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases “ghg” continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors are considering ways to reduce ghg emissions there is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances the impact of any future mandatory ghg legislative or regulatory requirements on the company’s businesses and products is dependent on the design of the mandate and so the company is unable to predict its significance at this time 

  

furthermore the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company’s customers and therefore on the company’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions these may include changes in weather patterns including drought and rainfall levels water availability storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels these potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of john deere’s operations 

  

the risks identified above should be considered in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis beginning on page 15 and specifically the other risks described in the safe harbor statement on pages 17 and 18 the company’s results of operations may be affected by these identified risks andor by risks not currently contemplated

equipment operations 

  

agricultural equipment 

  

sales of agricultural equipment particularly in the united states and canada are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels interest rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels energy costs and other input costs associated with farming other important factors affecting new equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of equipment purchasers 

  

innovations to machinery and technology also influence buying for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations the company has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced technology and global satellite positioning to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields improve soil conservation and minimize chemical use and to gather information 

  

  

large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the united states is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters and selfpropelled sprayers 

  

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment the company offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the agricultural equipment segment incurs substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of equipment the agricultural equipment segment also incurs costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during offseason periods in the united states and canada used equipment tradeins of which there are typically several transactions for every new combine and cotton harvesting equipment sale are supported with a fixed pool of funds available to dealers which are then responsible for all associated inventory and sale costs

  

an important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a diverse variety of shortline and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods because of industry conditions especially the merger of certain large integrated competitors and the global capability of many competitors the agricultural equipment business continues to undergo significant change and may become even more competitive

 item 1a   risk factors

  

governmental actions  the company’s agricultural business is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties related to the action or inaction of governmental bodies the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the world trade organization could have a material effect on the international flow of agricultural commodities which may result in a corresponding effect on the demand for agricultural equipment in many areas of the world

  

in the united states the 2007 farm bill may significantly affect prices for farm commodities particularly corn cotton and rice and this in turn could affect farmers’ demand for the company’s products and services 

  

the policies of the brazilian government including those related to exchange rates and commodity prices could significantly change the dynamics of the agricultural economy in that country 

  

  

changing demand for farm outputs  changing worldwide demand for food and the demand for different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on prices for farm commodities and consequently the demand for the company’s agricultural equipment

  

globalization  the continuing globalization of agricultural businesses may significantly change the dynamics of the company’s competition customer base and product offerings the company’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent on its success in developing additional geographic markets

  

economic condition and outlook  general economic conditions can affect the demand for the company’s equipment as well negative economic conditions or a negative outlook for example can decrease housing starts and other construction and dampen demand for equipment weakness in the overall farm economy can have a similar effect on agricultural equipment sales

  

consumer attitudes  the confidence the company’s customers have in the general economic outlook can have a significant effect on their propensity to purchase equipment and consequently on the company’s sales the company’s ability to match its new product offerings to its customers’ anticipated preferences for enhanced technologies and different types and sizes of equipment is important as well

  

weather poor or unusual weather conditions particularly in the spring can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of the company’s customers particularly the customers of the agricultural and commercial and consumer segments sales in the important spring selling season can have a dramatic effect on the commercial and consumer segment’s financial results

  

raw material costs  changes in the availability and price of raw materials such as steel rubber and fuel used in the production of the company’s equipment could have an effect on its costs of production and in turn on the profitability of the business

  

interest rates and credit ratings  if interest rates rise they could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and could affect the demand for the company’s equipment in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to the company’s credit segment decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect the company’s returns as well

 item 1   business 

products 

deere  company company and its subsidiaries collectively called john deere have operations which are categorized into four major business segments 

the agricultural equipment segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm equipment and related service parts — including tractors combine cotton and sugarcane harvesters tillage seeding and soil preparation machinery sprayers hay and forage equipment integrated agricultural management systems technology and precision agricultural irrigation equipment 

the commercial and consumer equipment segment manufactures and distributes equipment products and service parts for commercial and residential uses — including tractors for lawn garden commercial and utility purposes mowing equipment including walkbehind mowers golf course equipment utility vehicles landscape products and irrigation equipment and other outdoor power products 

the construction and forestry segment manufactures distributes to dealers and sells at retail a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction earthmoving material handling and timber harvesting — including backhoe loaders crawler dozers and loaders fourwheeldrive loaders excavators motor graders articulated dump trucks landscape loaders skidsteer loaders and log skidders feller bunchers log loaders log forwarders log harvesters and related attachments 

the products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets 

the credit segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used agricultural commercial and consumer and construction and forestry equipment in addition it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment provides operating loans finances retail revolving charge accounts offers certain crop risk mitigation products and invests in wind energy generation 

john deere’s worldwide agricultural equipment commercial and consumer equipment and construction and forestry operations are sometimes referred to as the “equipment operations” the credit and certain miscellaneous service operations are sometimes referred to as “financial services” 

additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on pages 19 and 20 the john deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837 the present company was incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1958 

the company’s internet address is httpwwwjohndeerecom through that address the company’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the securities and exchange commission the information contained on the company’s website is not included in or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

  

market conditions and outlook the company’s equipment sales are projected to be roughly flat for the full year and to increase approximately 5 percent for the first quarter of 2007 compared to the same periods in 2006 consistent with ongoing asset management initiatives production levels are expected to be down about 4 percent for both the year and first quarter construction and forestry production in the united states and canada is expected to be down about 16 percent in the first quarter based on the above net income is forecast to be around 1325 billion for the year and in a range of 150 million to 175 million for the first quarter 

agricultural equipment  worldwide farm economic conditions remain quite promising demand for crops is benefiting from a global population that is gaining in both size and affluence and from a sharp rise in the use of renewable fuels in the united states and other parts of the world prices for key farm commodities have surged recently and worldwide carryover stocks for wheat and corn are at 30 year lows in relation to consumption nevertheless fiscal 2007 sales in the united states and canada are expected to get off to a slow start as a result of higher than desired used equipment inventories and customer uncertainty regarding the direction of united states farm legislation in addition farmers’ concerns over the sustainability of the recent commodity price rally and with respect to input costs are expected to weigh on 2007 sales based on these factors the company projects that industry retail sales in the united states and canada will be roughly flat for the year 

in western europe industry retail sales are forecast to be flat to down slightly for the year due to the effect of a higher valueadded tax in germany and further farm consolidation following the sharp downturn of the last two years industry sales in south america are expected to be down about 10 percent for 2007 the forecast reduction is primarily related to uncertainty over government sponsored financing programs in brazil sales in australia are expected to be down by nearly 25 percent for the year due in large part to the effect of serious drought on the nation’s wheat crop 

based on these factors and market conditions worldwide sales of john deere agricultural equipment are forecast to increase by about 4 percent for full year 2007 first quarter sales are expected to rise by about 10 percent being driven by new products in europe and by a late calendar year 2006 sales pickup in germany expected in advance of the valueadded tax hike on january 1 farm machinery production in the united states and canada is expected to be down approximately 8 percent for the first quarter in comparison with the same period a year ago 

commercial  consumer equipment  john deere commercial and consumer equipment sales are forecast to be up about 4 percent for the year growth in the landscapes operations and the successful introduction of new products are expected to more than offset the impact of a softer market for residential housing 

construction  forestry  markets for construction and forestry equipment are expected to see a slowdown in 2007 while nonresidential spending is forecast for further improvement residential housing construction is expected to be lower in this environment the company’s worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to decrease by about 5 percent for fiscal 2007 

credit  full year 2007 net income for deere’s credit operations is forecast to be approximately 345 million the expected improvement is being driven by growth in the credit portfolio largely offset by higher selling and administrative expenses in support of division growth initiatives 

2006 consolidated results compared with 2005 worldwide net income in 2006 was 1694 million or 718 per share diluted 726 basic compared with 1447 million or 587 per share diluted 595 basic in 2005 income from continuing operations which excludes the company’s discontinued health care business see note 2 was 1453 

  

million or 616 per share diluted 623 basic in 2006 compared to 1414 million or 574 per share diluted 581 basic last year net sales and revenues from continuing operations increased 5 percent to 22148 million in 2006 compared with 21191 million in 2005 net sales of the equipment operations increased 2 percent in 2006 to 19884 million from 19401 million last year this included a positive effect for price changes of 3 percent equipment net sales in the united states and canada increased 3 percent in 2006 net sales outside the united states and canada increased by 2 percent which included a negative effect of 1 percent for currency translation 

worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of 1905 million in 2006 compared with 1842 million in 2005 higher operating profit was primarily due to improved price realization and lower retirement benefit costs partially offsetting these factors were increased raw material costs higher selling and administrative expenses the impact of lower shipping volumes and increased spending for research and development 

the equipment operations’ net income was 1089 million in 2006 compared with 1096 million in 2005 the same operating factors mentioned above along with the expense related to the repurchase of certain outstanding debt securities and higher effective tax rates affected these results 

net income of the company’s financial services operations in 2006 increased to 584 million compared with 345 million in 2005 primarily due to the sale of the health care operations income from the financial services continuing operations in 2006 was 344 million compared with 312 million in 2005 the increase was primarily a result of growth in the credit portfolio partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses additional information is presented in the following discussion of the credit operations 

income from discontinued operations was 241 million in 2006 or 102 per share diluted 103 basic compared to 33 million or 13 per share diluted 14 basic last year the increase was primarily due to the previously mentioned sale of the health care operations 

the cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2006 was 773 percent compared to 782 percent last year the decrease was primarily due to improved price realization and lower retirement benefit costs partially offset by higher raw material costs and lower shipping volumes 

finance and interest income and interest expense increased this year primarily due to growth in the credit operations portfolio and higher financing rates other income increased this year primarily due to investment income from marketable securities insurance premiums for extended warranties crop insurance commissions and service income research and development costs increased this year due to a large number of new products selling administrative and general expenses increased primarily due to growth sharebased compensation expense and the provision for credit losses other operating expenses were higher primarily as a result of the expense related to the repurchase of outstanding notes see note 3 extended warranty claims depreciation related to a higher level of equipment on operating leases and service expenses 

the company has several defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit health care and life insurance plans the company’s postretirement benefit costs for these plans in 2006 were 447 million compared to 538 million in 2005 the longterm expected return on plan assets which is reflected in these costs was an expected gain of 84 percent in 2006 and 85 percent in 2005 or 795 million in 2006 compared to 744 million in 2005 the actual return was a gain of 1364 million in 2006 compared to a gain of 1057 million in 2005 in 2007 the expected return will be approximately 84 percent the total unrecognized losses related to the plans at october 31 2006 and 2005 were 3693 million and 3969 million respectively the company expects postretirement benefit costs in 2007 to be approximately the same as 2006 the company makes any required contributions to the plan assets under applicable regulations and voluntary contributions from time to time based on the company’s liquidity and ability to make taxdeductible contributions total company contributions to the plans were 866 million in 2006 

  

and 859 million in 2005 which include direct benefit payments for unfunded plans these contributions also included voluntary contributions to the united states plan assets of 739 million in 2006 and 556 million in 2005 total company contributions in 2007 are expected to be approximately 443 million including voluntary contributions to united states plan assets of approximately 340 million see the following discussion of “critical accounting policies” for more information about postretirement benefit obligations 

additional information on 2006 results is presented on pages 18  20 

equipment operations 

agricultural equipment 

sales of agricultural equipment particularly in the united states and canada are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels interest rates agricultural trends including the production of and demand for renewable fuels energy costs and other input costs associated with farming other important factors affecting new equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment including tractors harvesting equipment selfpropelled sprayers and seeding equipment weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of equipment purchasers 

innovations to machinery and technology also influence buying for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations the company has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced technology and global satellite positioning to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields to improve environmental management and to gather information 

large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the united states is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters and selfpropelled sprayers 

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment the company offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the equipment operations incur substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of equipment the equipment operations also incur costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment is sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during offseason periods in the united states and canada used equipment tradeins of which there are typically several transactions for every new combine and cotton harvesting equipment sale are supported with a fixed pool of funds available to dealers which are then responsible for all associated inventory and sale costs 

an important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a diverse variety of shortline and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods because of industry conditions especially the merger of certain large integrated competitors and the global capability of many competitors the agricultural equipment business continues to undergo significant change and may become even more competitive 

  

commercial and consumer equipment 

the john deere commercial and consumer segment includes frontengine lawn tractors lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors utility tractors zeroturning radius mowers front mowers and a variety of utility vehicles a broad line of associated implements for mowing tilling snow and debris handling aerating and many other residential commercial golf and sports turf care applications are also included the product line also includes walkbehind mowers and other outdoor power products retail sales of these commercial and consumer equipment products are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year the production and shipment schedules of the company’s product lines closely correspond to the seasonal pattern of retail sales 

the division manufactures and sells walkbehind mowers in europe under the sabo brand as well as the john deere brand the division also builds products for sale by mass retailers since 1999 the company has built products for sale through the home depot in 2006 the company began selling products through lowe’s as well 

john deere landscapes inc a unit of the division distributes irrigation equipment nursery products and landscape supplies primarily to landscape service professionals 

in addition to the equipment manufactured by the commercial and consumer division john deere purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale

 item 1a risk factors 

governmental actions  the company’s agricultural business is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties related to the action or inaction of governmental bodies the outcome of the global negotiations under the auspices of the world trade organization could have a material effect on the international flow of agricultural commodities which may result in a corresponding effect on the demand for agricultural equipment in many areas of the world 

in the united states the 2007 farm bill may significantly affect prices for farm commodities particularly corn cotton and rice and this in turn could affect farmers’ demand for the company’s products and services 

the policies of the brazilian government including those related to exchange rates and commodity prices could significantly change the dynamics of the agricultural economy in that country 

changing demand for farm outputs  changing worldwide demand for food and the demand for different forms of bioenergy could have an effect on prices for farm commodities and consequently the demand for the company’s agricultural equipment 

globalization  the continuing globalization of agricultural businesses may significantly change the dynamics of the company’s competition customer base and product offerings the company’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a large extent on its success in developing geographic markets 

economic condition and outlook  general economic conditions can affect the demand for the company’s equipment as well negative economic conditions or a negative outlook for example can decrease housing starts and other construction and dampen demand for equipment weakness in the overall farm economy can have a similar effect on agricultural equipment sales 

consumer attitudes  the confidence the company’s customers have in the general economic outlook can have a significant effect on their propensity to purchase equipment and consequently on the company’s sales the company’s ability to match its new product offerings to its customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment is important as well 

weather   poor or unusual weather conditions particularly in the spring can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of the company’s customers particularly the customers of the agricultural and commercial and consumer segments sales in the important spring selling season can have a dramatic effect on the commercial and consumer segment’s financial results 

raw material costs  changes in the availability and price of raw materials such as steel rubber and fuel used in the production of the company’s equipment could have an effect on its costs of production and in turn on the success of the business 

interest rates and credit ratings  if interest rates rise they could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and could affect the demand for the company’s equipment in addition funding costs are very important to the company’s credit segment decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can increase the company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect the company’s returns as well 

the risks identified above should be considered in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis beginning on page 18 and specifically the other risks described in the safe harbor statement on pages 20 and 21 the company’s results of operations may be affected by these identified risks andor by risks not currently contemplated

 item 1   business

  

products 

  

deere  company company and its subsidiaries collectively called john deere have operations which are categorized into four major business segments 

  

the agricultural equipment segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm equipment and related service parts  including tractors combine cotton and sugarcane harvesters tillage seeding and soil preparation machinery sprayers hay and forage equipment material handling equipment and integrated agricultural management systems technology 

  

the commercial and consumer equipment segment manufactures and distributes equipment products and service parts for commercial and residential uses — including tractors for lawn garden commercial and utility purposes mowing equipment including walkbehind mowers golf course equipment utility vehicles including those commonly referred to as allterrain vehicles or “atvs” landscape products and irrigation equipment and other outdoor power products 

  

the construction and forestry segment manufactures distributes to dealers and sells at retail a broad range of machines and service parts used in construction earthmoving material handling and timber harvesting — including backhoe loaders crawler dozers and loaders fourwheeldrive loaders excavators motor graders articulated dump trucks landscape loaders skidsteer loaders and log skidders feller bunchers log loaders log forwarders log harvesters and related attachments 

  

the products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets 

  

the credit segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used agricultural commercial and consumer and construction and forestry equipment in addition it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment provides operating loans finances retail revolving charge accounts offers certain crop risk mitigation products and invests in wind energy development 

  

john deere also provides managed health care plans john deere’s worldwide agricultural equipment commercial and consumer equipment and construction and forestry operations are sometimes referred to as the “equipment operations” the credit health care and certain miscellaneous service operations are sometimes referred to as “financial services” 

  

additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on pages 17 and 18 the john deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837 the present company was incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1958 

  

the company’s internet address is httpwwwjohndeerecom through that address the company’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the securities and exchange commission the information contained on the company’s website is not included in or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

  

  

market conditions and outlook   company equipment sales are expected to increase by 1 to 3 percent for fullyear 2006 and by 11 to 14 percent for the first quarter production levels are expected to be down slightly for the year but up about 4 percent in the first quarter the company intends to sell its health care operations for a gain of approximately 225 million aftertax based on the above net income is forecast to be around 17 billion approximately 15 billion excluding the gain on the sale of the health care operations for the year and in a range of 175 million to 200 million for the first quarter 

  

agricultural equipment  although the farm sector is expected to remain in solid financial condition industry sales in the united states and canada are forecast to be down 5 to 10 percent in 2006 factors contributing to the decline include concerns over higher farm input costs especially for fuel and fertilizer the absence of united states tax incentives which helped sales in the first part of 2005 and slightly lower cash receipts farmers are expected to benefit from debt levels that remain well under control and from rising land values

  

in other parts of the world industry retail sales in western europe are forecast to be down about 5 percent for the year concerns over higher input costs government policies and the future direction of farm subsidies are expected to put downward pressure on sales in the region for the year in south america industry sales are forecast to be down about 5 percent as a result of a relatively strong brazilian currency a reduction in soybean acreage in brazil and concerns regarding footandmouth disease 

  

based on these factors and market conditions worldwide sales of john deere agricultural equipment are forecast to be down 2 to 4 percent for the year company sales are expected to benefit from a number of newly introduced products including a line of morepowerful and fuelefficient large tractors 

  

commercial  consumer equipment  sales of john deere commercial and consumer equipment are forecast to be up 10 to 12 percent for the year with benefit from newly introduced products an assumed return to more normal weather patterns and a full year of sales from the division’s recent landscapesbusiness acquisition division sales are also expected to be helped by an expanded presence of john deere products in the mass channel

  

construction  forestry  markets for construction equipment are forecast to experience further growth in 2006 as a result of united states economic conditions conducive to a healthy level of construction spending especially in the nonresidential sector on this basis contractors and rental companies are expected to continue updating and expanding their fleets forestry equipment markets are projected to remain near last year’s level in the united states and canada and to be lower in europe in this environment deere’s worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to rise by 5 to 7 percent for fiscal 2006

  

financial services  fullyear net income for the company’s financial services operations is forecast to be about 565 million approximately 340 million excluding the gain on the sale of the health care operations net income for the credit operations is expected to improve due to growth in the credit portfolio

  

2005 consolidated results compared with 2004   the company had net income in 2005 of 1447 million or 587 per share diluted 595 basic compared with 1406 million or 556 per share diluted 569 basic in 2004 net sales and revenues increased 10 percent to 21931 million in 2005 compared with 19986 million in 2004 net sales of the equipment operations increased 10 percent in 2005 to 19401 million from 17673 million last year net sales in the united states and canada rose 10 percent in 2005 outside the united states and canada net sales increased by 6 percent excluding currency translation and by 10 percent on a reported basis 

  

  

the company’s equipment operations had net income of 1096 million in 2005 compared with 1097 million in 2004 net income decreased primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses increased manufacturing overhead costs related to production system improvements and higher research and development costs these factors were partially offset by the margin on higher shipments and lower retirement benefit costs improved price realization offset higher raw material costs in addition this year’s results benefited from increased interest and investment income and a lower effective tax rate 

  

net income of the company’s financial services operations in 2005 was 345 million compared with 309 million in 2004 the increase was primarily due to growth in the credit operations portfolio a lower credit loss provision and increased underwriting margins in health care additional information is presented in the following discussion of the credit and “other” operations 

  

additional information on 2005 results is presented on pages 16  18 

  

equipment operations 

  

agricultural equipment 

  

sales of agricultural equipment particularly in the united states and canada are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels interest rates agricultural trends energy costs and other input costs associated with farming weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of equipment purchasers 

  

innovations to machinery and technology also influence buying for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations the company has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced technology and global satellite positioning to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields to improve environmental management and to gather information 

  

large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the united states is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters and selfpropelled sprayers 

  

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment the company offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the equipment operations incur substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of equipment the equipment operations also incur costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment is sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during offseason periods in the united states and canada used equipment tradeins of which there are typically several transactions for every new combine and cotton harvesting equipment sale are supported with a fixed pool of funds available to dealers which are then responsible for all associated inventory and sale costs

  

an important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a diverse variety of shortline and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods because of industry conditions especially the merger of certain large integrated 

  

  

competitors and the global capability of many competitors the agricultural equipment business continues to undergo significant change and may become even more competitive 

  

commercial and consumer equipment 

  

john deere commercial and consumer equipment includes frontengine lawn tractors lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors utility tractors zeroturning radius mowers front mowers and a variety of utility vehicles a broad line of associated implements for mowing tilling snow and debris handling aerating and many other residential commercial golf and sports turf care applications are also included the product line also includes walkbehind mowers and other outdoor power products retail sales of these commercial and consumer equipment products are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year the production and shipment schedules of the company’s product lines closely correspond to the seasonal pattern of retail sales 

  

the division manufactures and sells walkbehind mowers in europe under the sabo brand as well as the john deere brand the division also builds products for sale by mass retailers since 1999 the company has built products for sale through the home depot stores and in 2006 will begin selling its products through lowe’s stores 

  

john deere landscapes inc a unit of the division distributes irrigation equipment nursery products and landscape supplies primarily to landscape service professionals 

  

in addition to the equipment manufactured by the commercial and consumer division john deere purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale 

  

seasonality retail demand for the division’s equipment normally is higher in the second and third quarters the division is pursuing a strategy of building and shipping as close to retail demand as possible consequently production shipping and retail sales normally will be proportionately higher in the second and third quarters of each year

products 

  

deere  company company and its subsidiaries collectively called john deere have operations which are categorized into four major business segments 

  

the agricultural equipment segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm equipment and related service parts — including tractors combine cotton and sugarcane harvesters tillage seeding and soil preparation machinery sprayers hay and forage equipment material handling equipment and integrated agricultural management systems technology 

  

the commercial and consumer equipment segment manufactures and distributes equipment products and service parts for commercial and residential uses — including small tractors for lawn garden commercial and utility purposes walkbehind mowers golf course equipment utility vehicles including those commonly referred to as allterrain vehicles or “atvs” landscape products and irrigation equipment and other outdoor power products

the products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets 

  

the credit segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used agricultural commercial and consumer and construction and forestry equipment in addition it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment provides operating loans finances retail revolving charge accounts and plans to offer certain crop risk mitigation products 

  

john deere also provides managed health care plans john deere’s worldwide agricultural equipment commercial and consumer equipment and construction and forestry operations are sometimes referred to as the “equipment operations” the special technologies operations were combined with the agricultural equipment operations in 2004 the credit health care and certain miscellaneous service operations are sometimes referred to as “financial services” 

  

additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on pages 16 and 17 the john deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837 the present company was incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1958 

  

the company’s internet address is httpwwwjohndeerecom through that address the company’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the securities and exchange commission the information contained on the company’s website is not included in or incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

  

  

market conditions and outlook   as a result of the factors and conditions outlined below company equipment sales for 2005 are expected to increase by 2 to 7 percent with net income forecast to be approximately 15 billion firstquarter equipment sales are currently forecast to be up 20 to 25 percent in comparison with the same period last year production levels are expected to increase by 11 to 13 percent for the quarter consolidated net income for firstquarter 2005 is forecast to be in a range of 200 million to 225 million beyond the ongoing impact of the company’s businessimprovement efforts a positive customer response to john deere products is expected to continue driving performance in 2005 

  

agricultural equipment  on a worldwide basis sales of john deere agricultural equipment are forecast to be up 2 to 5 percent for the year despite a downturn in commodity prices united states farmers are benefiting from record production of corn and soybeans in addition the livestock and dairy sectors are strong and government payments are expected to increase substantially in 2005 as a result united states farmcash receipts are forecast to be about the same as 2004’s record level given these conditions the company expects industry retail sales in the united states and canada to be up about 5 percent for fiscal 2005 in comparison with the very strong levels of the prior year

  

in other parts of the world industry retail sales in western europe are forecast to be flat to down 5 percent for the year farmers in the region have benefited from a good harvest this fall however they are expected to see little change in income as a result of lower grain prices higher input costs and flat governmentsupport payments in south america industry sales are forecast to be down 10 to 20 percent on the basis of lower commodity prices increased input costs and a weaker united states dollar 

  

commercial  consumer equipment  sales of john deere commercial and consumer equipment are expected to increase 2 to 5 percent for the year with help from new models of compact tractors an updated utilityvehicle line and higher sales of commercial mowing equipment

  

construction  forestry  markets are expected to be supported in the coming year by moderate economic growth relatively low interest rates and a favorable level of housing starts in this environment sales of construction and forestry equipment are expected to see further growth as contractors and rental operations continue to replenish their fleets as a result division sales are forecast to be up 6 to 9 percent for the year

  

financial services  although the company’s credit operations are expected to benefit from further growth in the loan portfolio net income for 2005 is forecast to be down primarily due to increased leverage in the portfolio the credit division is expected to report net income of around 280 million for the year in its healthcare operations the company expects net income of about 15 million for 2005 as a result of an improved underwriting margin

  

2004 consolidated results compared with 2003   the company had net income in 2004 of 1406 million or 556 per share diluted 569 basic compared with 643 million or 264 per share diluted 268 basic in 2004 net sales and revenues increased 29 percent to 19986 million in 2004 compared with 15535 million in 2003 net sales of the equipment operations increased 32 percent in 2004 to 17673 million from 13349 million last year net sales increased primarily due to higher shipments net sales in the united states and canada rose 33 percent in 2004 outside the united states and canada net sales increased by 20 percent for the year excluding currency translation and by 30 percent on a reported basis 

  

the company’s equipment operations which exclude the financial services operations had net income of 1097 in 2004 compared with 305 million in 2003 income increased primarily due to increased 

  

  

shipments and price realization the increase was partially offset by a larger provision for employee bonuses and higher raw material costs the provision for bonuses was driven by the strong performance in the equipment operations 

  

net income of the company’s financial services operations in 2004 was 309 million compared with 330 million in 2003 the decrease was primarily due to higher administrative costs lower credit margins and increased medical claims costs additional information is presented in the worldwide credit operations and worldwide other operations discussions on page 16 

  

equipment operations 

  

agricultural equipment 

  

sales of agricultural equipment particularly in the united states and canada are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels interest rates agricultural trends and other input costs associated with farming weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of equipment purchasers 

  

innovations to machinery and technology also influence buying for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations the company has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced technology and global satellite positioning to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields to improve environmental management and to gather information 

  

large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the united states is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters and selfpropelled sprayers 

  

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment the company offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the equipment operations incur substantial seasonal variation in cash flows to finance production and inventory of equipment the equipment operations also incur costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment is sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers to take delivery of machines during offseason periods used equipment tradeins of which there are typically several transactions for every new combine and cotton harvesting equipment sale are supported with a fixed pool of funds available to dealers which are then responsible for all associated inventory and sale costs

  

an important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a diverse variety of shortline and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods because of industry conditions especially the merger of certain large integrated competitors and the global capability of many competitors the agricultural equipment business continues to undergo significant change and may become more competitive 

  

  

commercial and consumer equipment 

  

john deere commercial and consumer equipment includes frontengine lawn tractors lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors utility tractors zeroturning radius mowers front mowers and small utility vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2003 the division expanded its offering of utility vehicles with new products focused on residential commercial agricultural and consumer markets a broad line of associated implements for mowing tilling snow and debris handling aerating and many other residential commercial golf and sports turf care applications are also included the product line also includes walkbehind mowers and other outdoor power products retail sales of these commercial and consumer equipment products are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions in an effort to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories through the year the company has recently modified the production and shipment schedules of its product lines to more closely correspond to the seasonal pattern of retail sales 

  

the division manufactures and sells walkbehind mowers in europe under the sabo brand as well as the john deere brand and a line of commercial mowing equipment primarily in north america under the great dane brand the division also builds products for sale by mass retailers since 1999 the company has built products for sale through the home depot stores

the credit segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used agricultural commercial and consumer and construction and forestry equipment in addition it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment provides operating loans and finances retail revolving charge accounts 

  

john deere is also engaged in special technologies operations and provides managed health care plans john deere’s worldwide agricultural equipment commercial and consumer equipment construction and forestry and special technologies operations are sometimes referred to as the “equipment operations” the credit and health care operations are sometimes referred to as “financial services”

market conditions and outlook 

  

as a result of the factors and conditions outlined below sales for the full 2004 fiscal year are expected to increase between 9 and 11 percent and net income is forecast to be in a range of 750 million to 850 

  

million the company’s net equipment sales for the first quarter of 2004 are currently forecast to be up approximately 25 percent in comparison with depressed sales levels in the first quarter of 2003 although production levels are expected to increase only 9 to 11 percent for the first quarter companywide net income for the first quarter in 2004 is forecasted in a range of 100 million to 150 million excluding the impact of currency and price sales are expected to increase 18 to 20 percent for the quarter and 6 to 8 percent for the year 

  

the company’s yearly earnings estimate also includes an increase of approximately 125 million pretax in postretirement benefit costs based on the company’s assumptions that reflect recent trends in medical inflation and interest rates 

  

agricultural equipment after hitting a record level in 2003 united states farm income is expected to remain strong in the coming year as a result of continuing high crop and livestock prices as well as favorable levels of carryover stocks in farm commodities in addition tax provisions that offer expanded depreciation and expense writeoffs should lend further support to farm machinery sales as a result of these positive factors industry retail sales in the united states and canada are now expected to be up 5 to 10 percent for fiscal 2004 in other parts of the world industry retail sales in western europe are expected to be flat to down 5 percent for the year mainly as a result of lower farm income due to the impact of drought on the livestock sector the company believes industry sales in south america will be flat in 2004 while favorable conditions support further industry growth in south america the company believes this could be offset by the timing and availability of brazilian government financing on a worldwide basis sales of the company’s agricultural equipment are now forecast to be up between 8 to 10 percent for the year with an increase in physical volume of 5 to 7 percent 

  

commercial and consumer equipment the company’s commercial and consumer equipment sales are expected to continue benefiting from the success of new products including an expanded utilityvehicle line and the 100 series lawn tractor introduced in the mass and dealer channels in 2003 as a result the segment’s sales are forecast to be up between 10 to 12 percent for the year 

  

construction and forestry retail activity in the construction and forestry sectors rose at a healthy rate in 2003 mainly as a result of strong replacement demand the company’s sales for 2003 rose sharply in virtually all market segments and outpaced the industry further replacement demand is expected to lead to modest growth in the industry in 2004 in 2004 the company’s shipments of construction and forestry equipment are projected to be up 2 to 4 percent the company consolidated nortrax inc during the first quarter of 2004 nortrax inc and nortrax investments inc collectively called nortrax are ventures involved in the ownership and development of several construction equipment dealer locations including nortrax in the consolidated results will add an additional estimated 275 million to sales for the year 

  

credit operations although the company’s credit operations are expect to benefit from further growth in the loan portfolio net income for 2004 is forecast to be down slightly as a result of lower gains on receivable sales the credit operations expect net income of about 300 million for the year 

  

2003 consolidated results compared with 2002 

  

the company had net income in 2003 of 643 million or 264 per share diluted 268 basic compared with 319 million or 133 per share diluted 134 basic in 2002 the success of new products and ongoing efforts to manage costs and asset intensity were evident in the results for 2003 improved market conditions also contributed to the stronger performance of the company’s construction and forestry and commercial and consumer equipment segments additionally as a result of disciplined asset management trade receivables ended the year at their lowest level in more than a decade net sales and revenues increased 11 percent to 15535 million in 2003 compared with 13947 million in 2002 net sales of the equipment operations increased 14 percent in 2003 to 13349 million from 11703 million last year 

  

the company’s equipment operations which exclude the financial services operations had net income of 305 million in 2003 compared with 78 million in 2002 income increased primarily due to improved price realization and a higher physical volume of sales partially offsetting these factors were higher postretirement benefit costs of 306 million last year’s results were negatively affected by the costs of closing certain facilities and higher costs associated with the company’s minority investments in nortrax in addition prioryear results were negatively impacted by a higher effective tax rate 

  

net income of the company’s financial services operations in 2003 was 330 million compared with 262 million in 2002 the increase was due primarily to lower loan losses growth in the portfolio and the absence of losses from argentina related to the peso devaluation last year additional information is presented in the credit operations discussion on pages 17 20 and 21 

  

equipment operations 

  

agricultural equipment 

  

sales of agricultural equipment particularly in the united states and canada are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and the amount and timing of government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels interest rates agricultural trends and the levels of costs associated with farming weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of equipment purchasers 

  

innovations to machinery and technology also influence buying for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations the company has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced technology and global satellite positioning to enable farmers to better control input costs and yields to improve environmental management and to gather information 

  

large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the united states is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers selfpropelled forage harvesters and selfpropelled sprayers 

  

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment the company offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the equipment operations incur substantial seasonal indebtedness with related interest expense to finance production and inventory of equipment the equipment operations also incur costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand new combine and cotton harvesting equipment is sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers to take delivery of machines during offseason periods used equipment tradeins of which there are typically several transactions for every new machine sale are supported with a fixed pool of funds available to dealers which are then responsible for all associated inventory and sale costs 

  

an important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a diverse variety of shortline and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and 

  

marketing methods because of industry conditions especially the merger of certain large integrated competitors the agricultural equipment business continues to undergo significant change and may become more competitive

products 

  

deere  company company and its subsidiaries collectively called john deere have operations which are categorized into four major business segments 

  

the agricultural equipment segment manufactures and distributes a full line of farm equipment and service parts — including tractors combine cotton and sugarcane harvesters tillage seeding and soil preparation machinery sprayers hay and forage equipment material handling equipment and integrated agricultural management systems technology 

  

the commercial and consumer equipment segment manufactures and distributes equipment and service parts for commercial and residential uses — including small tractors for lawn garden commercial and utility purposes riding and walkbehind mowers golf course equipment utility vehicles landscape and irrigation equipment and other outdoor power products

the products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets 

  

the credit segment primarily finances sales and leases by john deere dealers of new and used agricultural commercial and consumer and construction and forestry equipment in addition it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment provides operating loans and finances retail revolving charge accounts 

  

john deere is also engaged in special technologies operations and provides managed health care plans john deere’s worldwide agricultural equipment commercial and consumer equipment construction and forestry and special technologies operations are sometimes referred to as the “equipment operations” the credit and health care operations are sometimes referred to as “financial services” 

  

additional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on pages 16 and 17 the john deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural machinery since 1837 the present company was incorporated under the laws of delaware in 1958 

  

market conditions and outlook 

  

based on the market conditions outlined below net equipment sales for the first quarter of 2003 are currently forecast to be up 20 to 25 percent from the same period last year with companywide net income from zero to 50 million the company expects equipment sales for the full year to be up 8 to 10 percent and enterprise net income to be in a range of 500 million to 600 million this includes the favorable impact of approximately 53 million after tax from the firstquarter adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets eliminating goodwill expense 

  

the company’s yearly earnings estimate also includes higher pension and postretirement benefit expense of between 250 million to 300 million pretax as the company is modifying its assumptions to reflect recent trends in medical inflation interest rates and equity returns this compares with an increase in that expense in 2002 of approximately 115 million before special items 

  

agricultural equipment  although commodity prices softened this fall they remain well above yearago levels and are helping support positive fundamentals in the global farm sector in the united states and canada however machinery sales have continued to lag mainly due to dryweather conditions and poor crop production in many key areas in addition while recently enacted legislation is generally supportive of higher farm income some farmers are feeling nearterm cash flow pressure due to the absence of emergency government payments as a result the company believes that retail activity may be slow early in 2003 but will gather momentum in conjunction with spring planting and be higher for the year in other areas the company’s sales in western europe are expected to grow in 2003 as the company builds on last year’s strong response to newly introduced products and further increases its presence in this important region the company’s sales in australia are expected to be down due to drought conditions while south american sales are forecast to be about the same as last year due to the uncertain economic situation in brazil as a result of these factors worldwide sales of john deere agricultural equipment are forecast to be up about 8 percent for the year 

  

commercial and consumer equipment  shipments of john deere commercial and consumer equipment are projected to be up about 15 percent for the year supporting the improved outlook is a recent strengthening in retail activity as well as the expected success of the new 100series line of john deere lawn tractors that will be available in the spring because of the company’s efforts in 2001 and 2002 to reduce field inventories sales are also expected to benefit from producing more in line with retail demand 

  

construction and forestry the company believes that construction equipment markets will continue to be pressured by lagging business investment and general weakness in sales to independent rental companies global forestry markets are expected to remain sluggish as well in this environment the company’s sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to be up about 2 percent for the year in may 2002 under a new marketing agreement with hitachi construction machinery co ltd of japan hitachi the company began distributing hitachi brand construction equipment in the united states and canada and mining equipment in all of the americas excluding these sales from both years the division sales are expected to decline approximately 2 percent 

  

credit operations credit results for 2003 are expected to benefit from lower writeoffs growth in the loan portfolio and stable margins on this basis net income for the year is projected to increase more than 20 percent to about 300 million 

  

2002 consolidated results compared with 2001 

  

the company had net income in 2002 of 319 million or 133 per share diluted 134 basic compared with a net loss of 64 million or 27 per share diluted 27 basic in 2001 special charges of 46 million or 18 per share diluted in 2002 and 217 million or 91 per share diluted in 2001 had a negative impact on the results for both years these charges were related to the costs of closing and restructuring certain facilities in both years and a voluntary earlyretirement program last year excluding these costs income in 2002 more than doubled to 365 million or 151 per share diluted compared with income of 153 million or 64 per share diluted in 2001 better price realization as well as the favorable impact of the company’s broadbased cost and expense reduction initiatives were the primary drivers of the improved results in 2002 in addition favorable customer response to new products contributed to achieving higher sales and more efficient production levels these factors in conjunction with a 323 million reduction in trade receivables 

  

and inventories helped generate consolidated cash flow from operations of 19 billion for the year well above 2001 levels net sales and revenues were 13947 million in 2002 compared to 13293 million in 2001 net sales of the equipment operations were 11703 million this year compared to 11077 million last year 

  

the company’s equipment operations which exclude the financial services operations had net income of 78 million in 2002 compared to a net loss of 238 million in 2001 before special items the income was 124 million in this year compared to a loss of 23 million last year income before special items increased primarily due to improved price realization cost and expense reductions higher sales of agricultural and commercial and consumer equipment and the absence of losses from the homelite consumer products business which was sold in addition the 2002 results benefited from lower interest expense partially offsetting these factors were the compensation to credit for financing trade receivables higher new product startup costs and costs associated with nortrax inc a venture involved in the ownership and development of several construction equipment dealer locations also having a negative effect were higher postretirement benefit costs lower production and sales from core construction and forestry operations in davenport and dubuque iowa and a higher tax rate 

  

net income of the company’s financial services operations in 2002 was 262 million compared to 192 million in 2001 additional credit operations information is presented on pages 17 20 and 21 health care premiums and fees and related health care claims and costs increased this year compared to last year primarily from increases in enrollment premium increases and medical cost inflation 

  

equipment operations 

  

agricultural equipment 

  

sales of agricultural equipment particularly in the united states and canada are affected by total farm cash receipts which reflect levels of farm commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and government payments sales are also influenced by general economic conditions farm land prices farmers’ debt levels interest rates agricultural trends and the levels of costs associated with farming weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of equipment purchasers 

  

innovations to machinery and technology also influence buying for example larger more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations the company has developed a comprehensive agricultural management systems approach using advanced technology and global satellite positioning that should enable farmers to better control input costs and yields and to improve environmental management 

  

large costefficient highlymechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output the largesize agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to john deere a large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the united states is comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower selfpropelled combines selfpropelled cotton pickers and selfpropelled forage harvesters 

  

seasonality  seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during various times of the year seasonal demand must be estimated in advance and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand in order to achieve efficient utilization of manpower and facilities throughout the year for certain equipment the company offers early order discounts to retail customers production schedules are based in part on these early order programs the equipment operations incur substantial seasonal indebtedness with related interest expense to finance production and inventory of equipment the equipment operations also incur costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand the equipment operations often encourage early 

retail sales decisions for both new and used equipment by waiving retail finance charges or offering lowrate financing during offseason periods and in early order promotions 

  

an important part of the competition within the agricultural equipment industry during the past decade has come from a diverse variety of shortline and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods because of industry conditions especially the merger of certain large integrated competitors the agricultural equipment business continues to undergo significant change and may become more competitive 

  

commercial and consumer equipment 

  

john deere commercial and consumer equipment includes rearengine riding mowers frontengine lawn tractors lawn and garden tractors compact utility tractors utility tractors front mowers and small utility vehicles a broad line of associated implements for mowing tilling snow and debris handling aerating and many other residential commercial golf and sports turf care applications are also included the product line also includes walkbehind mowers and other outdoor power products retail sales of commercial and consumer equipment products are influenced by weather conditions consumer spending patterns and general economic conditions
