we continue to expand and deepen our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world with the most broad and diversified portfolio of benchmark products we believe we have a significant opportunity to expand the participation of our nonus customer base in our markets our penetration of these markets lags our development in the us and we believe that there is room for significant growth and development of these financial markets in 2021 approximately 29 of our electronic

we provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to market participants for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing house our clearing services offer the ability to optimize collateral 

and capital efficiencies across portfolios within the clearing house while meeting the heightened regulatory requirements on derivatives the majority of our clearing volumes and activities are related to our listed futures and options which represents the majority of our open interest and collateral held against these positions we also offer clearing services for otc interest rate swaps fx forwards and commodity swaps the addition of our enhanced standard portfolio analysis of risk span margin framework cme span 2 will provide enhanced risk management capabilities in a single unified interface by maintaining spans current calculations and functions while incorporating several new modeling reporting and margin replication enhancements cme span 2 will initially be launched with certain futures and options on energy products and then expanded to other asset classes as cme span 2 is implemented margins for diversified portfolios will consist of products using the enhanced cme span 2 framework in addition to the existing span framework ensuring appropriate levels of offsets will continue to be provided across products subject to the span and span 2 frameworks

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has seen multiple new entrants over time and we expect competition to continue to intensify and become more global especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank european market infrastructure regulation emir emir 22 markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii capital requirements directive iv market abuse regulation benchmarks regulation basel iii and various other laws and regulations 

please also refer to the discussion below and in  item 1a — risk factors beginning on page 15 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties 

competition in our derivatives exchange business 

we believe competition in the derivatives business is based on a number of factors including among others 

• brand and reputation 

• efficient and secure settlement clearing and support services 

• depth and liquidity of markets 

• diversity of product offerings and frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services 

• ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs 

• efficient and seamless customer experience 

• transparency reliability anonymity and security in transaction processing 

• regulatory environment 

• connectivity accessibility flexibility in execution methods and distribution 

• technological capability and innovation and 

• overall transaction costs 

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse and complementary product offerings frequency and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from others in the industry we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop and offer new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability functionality and security maintain liquidity and low transaction costs continue to strengthen our risk management capabilities and solutions and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers 

we compete in a large and expanding financial services trading clearing and settlement marketplace globally our competitors include among other entities exchanges such as intercontinental exchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited and deutsche börse ag we have also seen the emergence of new players in the derivatives exchange business in some cases backed by market makers and brokerdealers as well as crypto platforms competition also includes alternative means of developing exposures through alternative instruments depending on market factors such as cash otc etfs options warrants contracts for differences structured products and other offerings and incorporates large customer and channel internalization of trade flows and data new emerging competitors have targeted different segments of our industry with multiple execution models and products and emerging technologies will continue to offer additional alternative products in the future competition in our industry continues to be dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business 

competition in our cme clearing business 

in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with compliance with doddfrank emir 22 basel iii mifid ii and other various laws and regulations 

our competitors in the clearing services space include among others companies such as ice lch group the occ depository trust  clearing corporation hong kong exchanges and clearing japan securities clearing corporation lme clearing and deutsche börse ag in light of the implementation of new regulatory requirements and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing and other related posttrade services such as nodal and eris in the us as cftcregulated designated clearing organizations we have also seen the acquisition of smaller clearing houses by larger and better capitalized firms including ftx’s acquisition of ledgerx 

we believe competition in clearing services is based on among other things the value of providing customers with capital and margin efficiencies quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house regulatory costs timely delivery of the services reputation diversity of the service offerings confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the fees charged for the services provided 

competition in our cash markets business 

the cash markets businesses face substantial competition across a wide and growing array of venues in the fx space the marketplace is highly fragmented and there is competition from other electronic communication networks singledealer platforms bankowned multiparticipant platforms streaming and request for quote services trading venues tied to data platforms voice brokers other broker enabled platforms and other venues there is a growing array of platforms and technologies and they are often owned by many wellcapitalized financial institutions and intermediaries that are also driving internalization of client fx trade flows in the fixed income space there are also multiple providers of treasury european and us repo and european bond trading as well as other products such as corporate bonds municipal bonds mortgagebacked bonds and agencies and a multitude of competitors and new entrants offering singledealer liquidity bankowned multiparticipant platforms streaming and request for quote services and other broker and exchangeenabled platforms 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data calculation and distribution capabilities that could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange multiple other industry players offer both referential and indicative pricing alternatives to cme offerings which are widely distributed and available across a variety of media distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products although we may receive license fees for such products such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable product 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are regulated and serve a customer base that includes regulated institutions or individuals developments in the regulatory environment therefore have the potential to significantly affect our businesses as such we are subject to extensive regulation primarily in the us and europe 

please also refer to the discussion below and in item 1a — risk factors beginning on page 15 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties 

regulation of our derivatives business cme clearing and our sef 

our operation of us futures exchanges cme clearing and our sef is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc that requires our regulated subsidiaries to satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures and swaps markets and clearing houses in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank 

regulations implementing doddfrank include rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain otc derivatives swap reporting operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting product definitions the definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets swap execution facilities and swap data repositories 

cme has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization these designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities by the cftc and the federal reserve board 

in connection with the global offering of our products and clearing services this business is also subject to the rules and regulations of the local jurisdictions in which we conduct business including the european securities and markets authority esma the uk financial conduct authority fca and bank of england and the netherlands authority for the financial markets afm 

regulation of our cash markets business 

the operation of our brokertec platform subjects us to regulation by the financial industry regulatory authority finra and the us securities and exchange commission sec as a brokerdealer and alternative trading system operator it also subjects us to regulation by authorities in the eu as a multilateral trading facility and regulated market and by the applicable regulators in singapore and canada our ebs business holds various permissions approvals and exemptions globally including those that subject certain of its activities to cftc fca the dutch authority for the financial markets afm and hong kong monetary authority hkma oversight 

the settlement of matched principal and exchangetraded businesses requires access to clearing houses either directly or through thirdparty providers of clearing and settlement services brokertec americas is a member of the ficc through which it clears us treasury and repo products 

regulation of our market data business 

a portion of our market data business offered by cme group benchmark administration is subject to regulation by the eu benchmarks regulation which regulates our repofunds rate suite of daily euro repo indices our cme group benchmark administration which is authorized as a benchmark administrator by the fca administers and calculates the cme term secured overnight financing rate sofr reference rates group of benchmarks 

key areas of focus 

we actively monitor and participate in the domestic and international legislative and rulemaking processes for our industry including providing government testimony commenting on proposed legislation and rulemaking and educating our regulators and policymakers on potential impacts to the marketplace we are also focused on the us presidential administration and its new federal regulatory appointees and any anticipated changes that may result 

our key areas of focus in the regulatory environment are 

• the fca’s announcement of its phase out of the use of libor which may unfavorably impact our ability to list our existing suite of eurodollar futures and options products 

• the implementation of a transaction tax or user fee in the us uk or eu  or in the states of illinois or new jersey which could discourage institutions and individuals from using our markets or products or encourage them to trade in another less costly jurisdiction legislation to impose a financial transaction tax has been proposed previously in the us congress illinois general assembly and state of new jersey legislature additionally from time to time including this fiscal year the proposed us presidential budget request has included a proposal to impose a user fee to fund all or a portion of the budget of the cftc legislation would be necessary to impose such a fee 

• the potential for further regulation stemming from industry performance disruptions and residual concerns around electronic trading activity and in particular high frequency trading 

• legislation that proposes to eliminate the 6040 tax treatment of certain of our futures and options contracts which would result in 60 of the gains being taxed at the shortterm capital gain rate instead of the longterm capital gain rate this would impose a significant increase in tax rates applicable to certain market participants and could result in a decrease in their trading activity 

• certain provisions in relation to the eu regulations on benchmarks have yet to come into effect and prices and data provided by cme group for use by eu supervised entities and use of those benchmarks may be impacted 

• concerns that european legislators will prohibit or restrict exclusive licenses for benchmark indexes which might impact the profitability of several of our most popular contracts 

• the implementation of rules resulting in negative treatment of the liquidity profile of us treasury securities including as qualifying liquidity resources or any potential limitation on the use of us treasury securities as collateral could result in increased costs to us and our clearing firms 

• the implementation of the final phases of uncleared margin rules umr phases 5  6 across jurisdictions and implications for customers management of exposures 

• the potential regulation of cryptocurrencies which may impact our existing offerings or our ability to provide future offerings

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of global market economic and political conditions that are beyond our control and that could significantly impact our business and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets the trading volumes in our markets are directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

• economic political and geopolitical market conditions 

• legislative and regulatory changes including any direct or indirect restrictions on or increased costs associated with trading in our markets or our clearing services 

• broad trends in the industry and financial markets 

• changes in price levels trading volumes and volatility in the derivatives cash and overthecounter otc markets and in their underlying markets 

• shifts in demand or supply in commodities underlying our products 

• competition 

• changes in government monetary policies including central bank decisions related to quantitative easing and the us federal reserve and other international banks forecasted interest rates 

• availability of capital to our market participants and their appetite for risktaking 

• levels of assets under our customers management 

• volatile weather patterns droughts natural disasters and other catastrophes 

• pandemics affecting our customer base or our ability to operate our markets and 

• consolidation or expansion in our customer base and within our industry 

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility however as evidenced by our past performance in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital the shifts in market trading patterns we experienced as a result of the financial crisis of 2008 may or may not recur in the future and our business will be affected by future economic uncertainties which may result in decreased trading volume and a more challenging business environment for us we believe that our interest rate product line could continue to be negatively impacted by a return to a zero interest rate policy a reduction in overall trading volume or in certain products could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenue material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

please see item 1a  risk factors  risks relating to our business beginning on page 19 for additional information 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business and our failure to maintain compliance with regulations our status as a regulated entity or brokertec americas status as a member in good standing at ficc could result in the loss of customers 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the us uk and european union as a result of our global operations we are also subject to the rules and regulations of other local jurisdictions in which we conduct business and offer our products and services as appropriate 

our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to extensive legislation and regulatory scrutiny and we face the risk of changes to our regulatory environment and business in the future and have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply additional new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed in the us or other jurisdictions which could change or require us to change our business practices or the structure of our business including its current governance or regulatory structure or impose significant costs on us by for example requiring more of our funds to be set aside for the guaranty fund this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients overall trading volume and demand for our market data and other services additionally regulations imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally may adversely impact their trading activity in our markets to the extent the legislative and regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

legislation may be proposed both domestically and internationally that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets if such proposals were to become law they could have a negative impact on our industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading and could make our markets less competitive with a resulting negative impact on our business financial condition and operating results 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market derivatives clearing organization swap execution facility swap data repository brokerdealer multilateral trading facility or other regulatory penalties 

our brokerdealer and multilateral trading facility businesses brokertec and ebs are also extensively regulated in various jurisdictions these regulatory obligations generally include proper licensing and qualification of the firms and individuals substantive conduct standards communication and disclosure rules monitoring and surveillance training capital requirements supervisory obligations maintenance of antimoney laundering programs suspicious activity reporting risk management standards trade reporting and ongoing examinations and reviews the risks from failing to comply with these regulatory obligations include potential liability disciplinary action against the firm and individuals monetary penalties and restrictions on future activities 

brokertec americas matched principal platform facilitates anonymous trading in significant volumes from wholesale market participants many of which are ficc members and understand that brokertec americas is also a ficc member such that their trades are expected to be novated promptly to ficc which will be their ultimate counterparty a failure of brokertec americas to maintain its membership could adversely impact the willingness of such participants to continue trading on our platform as part of maintaining its ficc membership brokertec americas is required to timely and fully meet all margin calls and other obligations established by ficc and as such must maintain ready access to sufficient liquidity to satisfy those obligations brokertec americas maintains access to liquidity resources it believes will satisfy these obligations in normal and stressed circumstances but there can be no guarantee it will never experience a shortfall 

please see item 1  business  regulatory matters beginning on page 11 for additional information on our areas of regulatory focus 

some of cme clearings largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

our clearing house seeks to offer customers intermediaries and clearing firms universal access in order to maximize the efficient use of capital exercise appropriate oversight of value at risk and maintain operating leverage from clearing activities on our exchanges our strategic business plan for our futures and options business is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business some of our clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions of futures or options from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition from other companies if we are not able to successfully compete our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and in some cases operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges otc markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large industry participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others our competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do 

our competitors may 

• respond more quickly to competitive pressures and opportunities including responses based upon their corporate governance structures which may be more flexible and efficient than our corporate governance structure 

• develop products that are preferred by our customers compared to those offered by cme group 

• develop risk transfer products that compete with our products 

• price their products and services more competitively 

• develop and expand their network infrastructure and service offerings more efficiently 

• utilize better more userfriendly or more reliable technology 

• take greater advantage of acquisitions alliances and other opportunities that provide a competitive advantage 

• more effectively market promote and sell their products and services 

• better leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners or exploit better recognized brand names to market and sell their services or 

• exploit regulatory disparities between traditional regulated exchanges and alternative markets that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lowercost business model 

if our products markets and services are not competitive or are viewed as less competitive our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected a decline in our fees or loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

please see item 1  business  competition beginning on page 10 for additional information on the competitive environment and its potential impact on our business 

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers at substantially similar trading levels or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase trading volume in our markets to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution facilities our preand posttrade services and clearing facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies in the 

past such as lowering the fees they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity payments or rebates we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to expand our products and services that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin 

our clearing firm clients must meet certain capital requirements and must deposit collateral to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements there is no guarantee the collateral deposited will continue to maintain its value to the extent a clearing firm were to experience a decrease in capital and be unable to meet requirements it may be required to decrease its trading activity 

additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts and a substantial decrease in their trading activity could have a negative impact on the liquidity of the particular product line or contract 

if we fail to maintain trading volume as a result of a loss of customers or decrease in trading activity expand our product offerings or execution facilities or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected declines in trading volume may also negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of trading volume because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis and our profitability could be adversely affected 

our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other cybersecurity risks our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats which could result in wrongful use of our data or our customers’ data or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in substantial liabilities we also could be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems andor investigate any alleged attack 

we regard the secure storage and transmission of data and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations and our operational resiliency our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to targeted attacks such as phishing attacks unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism ransom attacks firewall or encryption failures or other security or operational risks criminal groups political activist groups and nationstate actors have targeted the financial services industry in general and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other information security threats while we have not experienced cyber incidents that are individually or in the aggregate material we have experienced cyber attacks of varying degrees in the past 

our usage of mobile web and cloud technologies such as those pursuant to our partnership with google cloud may increase our risk of a cyber attack our security defenses may also be impacted or breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our technology systems and data or our customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the services we provide that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while resulting in regulatory penalties or the imposition of additional obligations by regulators or others as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous and complex any failure to comply may carry significant penalties and reputational damage 

we have designed our cyber defense program to mitigate such attacks and security risks through administrative physical and technical safeguards as part of our global information security and privacy programs we employ resources to prevent detect and respond to cyberattacks and security risks that could impact our people processes and technology infrastructure including the rapid response to zeroday vulnerabilities however our security measures or those of our thirdparty providers including any cloudbased technologies such as those pursuant to our partnership with google cloud may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed any security attack or breach could result in system failures and delays malfunctions in our operations loss of customers or lower trading volume loss of competitive position damage to our reputation disruption of our business legal liability or regulatory fines and significant costs which in turn may cause our revenues and earnings to decline though we have insurance against certain cyber and privacy risks and attacks we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and regulatory liability and penalties 

many aspects of our business present substantial litigation risks these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction or that we failed to effectively fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities we may be subject to disputes regarding the quality of trade execution the settlement of trades or other matters relating to our services we may become subject to these claims as a 

result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation to the extent we are found to have failed to fulfill our regulatory obligations we could lose our authorizations or licenses or become subject to conditions that could make future operations more costly and impair our profitability such events could also result in customer dissatisfaction and a decline in their willingness to trade on our markets 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism which poses physical security risks and cybersecurity risks than other companies 

given our role in the global financial services industry we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on our industry generally or on our business while we have implemented significant physical security protection measures business continuity plans and established backup sites to provide operational resiliency in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such an attack may result in harm to our personnel or the closure of our facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance coverage available or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks also may negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to our business 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economy including the us economy and the global financial markets and has disrupted our business and our clients’ businesses the ultimate impact from covid19 including duration is unknown and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the international and us economies and financial markets the spread of covid19 has caused illness quarantines cancellation of events and travel business and school shutdowns reduction in business activity and financial transactions labor shortages employee attrition supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability in the us similar impacts also have been experienced throughout the world including in every country in which we do business given the unique and unpredictable nature of this event future impacts to our business are unknown and could be material those impacts may include among others the following 

• continued disruption to our business and operations 

• key members of senior management or a significant number of our employees being unable to work as a result of contracting covid19 or related illnesses 

• reduced productivity and operating effectiveness as a result of our employees working remotely and impacts on our clients encountering similar circumstances 

• impacts on our thirdparty suppliers and their ability to fulfill their obligations to us 

• decreased trading volume and unprecedented market stresses in global financial markets 

• changes in demand for our products and services based upon fiscal monetary and trade policies adopted in response to the economic impact of the pandemic 

• reduced economic activity generally which could cause businesses to have less need to hedge in our markets 

• delays in our expansion investment strategic initiatives and system integrations 

• impacts to our ability to expand our client base grow our business and generate new revenue due to the inability to hold inperson meetings events and conferences and other impacts from social distancing 

• impacts on our brand and reputation due to negative investor sentiment in the overall financial markets 

• increased financial and operational stress experienced by our clearing firm members due to unprecedented volatility or downturn including significant losses that may result in a reduction of business or a default 

• market access or trading limitations imposed by governmental authorities and 

• increased technology and cybersecurity risks social engineering and phishing campaigns 

these potential impacts may exist for a significant period of time and may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided 

the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting employee travel and continuing workfromhome protocols and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine 

to be in the best interests of our employees and clients there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the pandemic or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic further impacts our business results of operations or financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict but may include among others the duration and spread of the pandemic including through new variant strains its severity the actions taken by governments and other third parties to contain the virus or treat its impact such as vaccination and the effect of such actions on our business practices including ending workfromhome protocols or transitioning to more hybrid work models the impact of existing and any future federal stimulus measures and the pace at which and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume or even if they resume whether such economic and operating conditions can be sustained 

in addition many of the other risk factors described herein could be heightened by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related economic conditions which could result in a material impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

damage to our reputation or brand could harm our business 

maintaining our reputation and brand is critical to attracting and retaining customers investors and employees and to maintaining our relationships with our regulators and other government officials negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our company products or services including social and environmental concerns relating to our company or certain commodity products and increased impact from climate change or criticism or market reaction to the performance of our market in periods of extreme volatility could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our business prospects these issues may include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a including risks from customer disputes system failures or intrusions failures to meet our regulatory obligations failures of a clearing firm or other counterparty issues relating to our thirdparty suppliers alleged or actual fraud or misconduct or manipulative activity or ineffective risk management 

the success of our markets depends on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading and clearing systems that have the functionality performance availability and resilience capacity security and speed required by our customers 

the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces for a wide range of products that have the required functionality performance availability and resilience capacity security and speed to attract and retain customers in 2021 93 of our overall contract volume was generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform and we generated 3363 million in revenue attributable to the brokertec and ebs trading platforms 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platforms and other technology offerings to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

• provide reliable and costeffective services to our customers 

• develop in a timely manner the required functionality to support electronic trading in a manner that is competitive with the functionality supported by other electronic markets 

• maintain the competitiveness of our fee structure 

• attract independent software vendors to write frontend software that will effectively access our electronic trading systems and automated order routing system 

• respond to technological developments or service offerings by competitors and 

• generate sufficient revenue to justify the substantial capital investment we have made and will continue to make to enhance our electronic trading platforms and other technology offerings 

if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading systems and technology offerings if we are unable to develop them to include other products and markets or if they do not have the required functionality performance availability and resilience capacity security and speed desired by our customers our ability to successfully compete and our revenues and profits will be adversely affected although we are focused on the technology and customer experience as part of the anticipated migration of the ebs platform to cme globex in the first half of 2022 we cannot guarantee that we will not experience any client attrition and to the extent any such client attrition is significant it could have a negative impact on our revenues 

additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

our business is highly dependent on our ability to process execute and monitor in an efficient and uninterrupted manner a large number of transactions which occur at high volumes and frequencies across multiple systems and our ability to access key business data financial information order processing and invoicing we are heavily reliant on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology and communications and other business systems and software supporting our operations our systems or those of our thirdparty providers including cloud providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

• unanticipated disruptions in service to our customers 

• slower response times and delays in our customers trade execution and processing 

• failed settlement of trades 

• incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades 

• financial losses 

• security breaches 

• litigation or other customer claims 

• loss of customers or 

• regulatory sanctions 

we cannot assure that we will not experience system failures from power or telecommunications failures acts of god war or terrorism human error on our part or on the part of our thirdparty providers or partners natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyber attacks acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems or the systems of our thirdparty providers do not operate properly are compromised or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platforms and technology offerings or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impact our trading volumes impair our reputation damage our brand result in regulatory fines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

regulations relating to our trading and clearing systems generally require the handling of anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause them to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in volume however we cannot assure that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance or speed increased trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of our platforms system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead our regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and as we execute our business strategy although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected 

we as well as many of our customers depend on thirdparty suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies internet service providers data processors cloud hosting providers data center providers and software and hardware vendors for 

elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance although we conduct due diligence and monitor important suppliers and service providers including their resiliency we cannot provide assurances of their performance and any interruption or cessation of their supplies or services could negatively impact our operations or those of our customers as well as affect our reputation financial or regulatory posture 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our trading platforms and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current and certify as to our enhancements and changes to their software to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our enhancements and changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services or provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased trading volume lower revenues and higher costs in addition while we may be entitled to recovery for breaches of or liabilities otherwise incurred in connection with our agreements with thirdparty suppliers and service providers such recovery is limited by the terms of these agreements and may not compensate us in full 

our business exposes us to substantial credit risk of our clearing firms and other counterparties and consequently a decrease in their financial resources could adversely affect us 

our clearing house operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles we routinely guarantee transactions submitted by our clearing firm customers with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one or more of our clearing firms additionally we are exposed to the risk of loss from the failure of a matched principal counterparty to settle its trades at brokertec americas 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations additionally brokertec americas is exposed to the potential risk of loss in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms and other counterparties can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a fund currently 980 million to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to qualified family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances if their clearing firm becomes insolvent 

our threemonth eurodollar futures and options contracts are based on the threemonth us dollar london interbank offered rate libor underlying rate to the extent trading in eurodollar contracts decreases or is discontinued and our alternative contracts are not successful our revenues would be negatively impacted certain of our other businesses could also be negatively affected by changes to libor 

our eurodollar futures and options contracts are based on the threemonth us dollar ice libor underlying rate in 2021 average trading volume in our eurodollar contracts was 35 million contracts and open interest was 408 million contracts the uk fca which regulates libor announced its intention to phase out the use of libor with the cessation of oneweek and twomonth usd libor as well as nonusd libor tenors after december 31 2021 and the cessation of publication of threemonth sixmonth and oneyear usd libor after june 30 2023 financial institutions that currently report information used to set usd libor are expected to stop doing so during 2023 and in 2021 the us federal reserve board and other regulatory bodies issued guidance encouraging banks and other financial market participants to cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate no later than december 31 2021 in light of regulatory guidance we expect banks and other financial market participants to cease entering into new contracts based on usd libor and there is no guarantee that they will reference rates associated with our alternative products 

the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions has recommended replacing usd libor with other benchmark alternatives such as secured overnight financing rate sofr however it is unknown whether these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for libor 

any transition away from libor to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we have closely engaged with the industry regulators and market participants to launch products using alternative reference rates including our sofr and sterling overnight index average 

sonia futures contracts while these actions have resulted in an increase in market acceptance of sofr there is no guarantee that this transition will be successful maintain current market structure or replace the revenue we derive from our eurodollar contracts if trading volume were to decline or discontinue altogether 

our market data revenues may be reduced by decreased demand poor overall economic conditions regulatory changes or a significant change in how market participants trade and use market data 

we offer a wide range of data services designed to support the trading risk management investment and business needs of our customers revenues from our market data and information services represented 12 and 11 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively factors that may affect our performance and demand for our data include but are not limited to 

• our ability to maintain existing customers utilizing our data and to attract new customers with our products and services 

• a decrease in overall trading volume which may lead to a decreased demand for our market data 

• a challenging business environment for our customers which may require them to reduce their usage of our market data 

• the impacts of new regulations laws rules or other government policies 

• our ability to ensure that customers are appropriately licensed and are paying fees for the data used 

• the protection of our intellectual property rights and identification of misappropriation andor misuses of cme group market data and 

• our ability to keep pace with technological developments and client preferences 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to execute on strategic initiatives to grow our business including efforts to serve the otc markets and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances our growth strategy also may subject us to increased legal compliance and regulatory obligations unless our growth results in an increase in revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions other investments and strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of historical merger and acquisition activity in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us which could impact our ability to identify growth opportunities we may issue additional equity andor debt in connection with strategic partnerships the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially 

the process of integration also may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from our growth initiatives and investments which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we also may be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively affect our stock price our joint venture osttra with ihs markit is subject to many of these risks including the potential we may not achieve the expected cost savings synergies and other strategic benefits from the transaction 

within the anticipated time frames that the joint venture may be more costly than expected or that we may experience customer attrition 

the expansion of our global operations is complex and subjects us to increased business and economic risks that could adversely affect our financial results 

in connection with our expanded global operations we face certain risks inherent in doing business internationally these risks include 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• complying with extensive and complex compliance requirements regulations and oversight by regulators other than our primary functional regulators 

• difficulties in staffing and associated costs in managing multiple international locations 

• general economic social and political conditions 

• protectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in some countries 

• reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 

• language and cultural differences and 

• potentially adverse tax consequences 

if we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully or if the risks above become substantial for us our financial performance and operating results could suffer further any measures we may implement to reduce risks of our international operations may not be effective may increase our expenses and may require significant management time and effort 

as our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements from local currencies into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore any increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

the euuk trade and cooperation agreement was effective on january 1 2021 as a result of brexit we have established certain cme group businesses in amsterdam an eu jurisdiction which allows these businesses to continue offering products and services to customers in the eu however this has resulted in and may continue to result in increased legal compliance and operational costs 

our risk management compliance and monitoring programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators including during supervisory engagements and regulatory examinations and we are subject to their inquiry and oversight our regulators have broad enforcement and supervisory powers including the power to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our regulatory designations or the registration of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to manage our risks and comply with applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of effective risk management compliance and monitoring programs in the case of alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

we maintain risk management compliance and monitoring policies procedures and programs that are designed to prevent detect deter monitor and manage our risks including enterprise risk and internal audit programs but such policies procedures and programs may not be fully effective some of our risk management processes depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers employees or other matters or potential threats that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal and compliance regulatory reputational and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot guarantee that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there continue to be highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct or manipulative activity by employees of financial services firms and other market participants improper trading activity on our platforms by participants could include activities such as spoofing layering wash trading and manipulation misconduct by our employees and agents could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or the company improper securities trading activities improper use or unauthorized disclosure of data or confidential information of the company or its customers among other potential misconduct 

it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases if we were found to have not met our regulatory oversight and compliance obligations we could be subject to regulatory sanctions enforcement actions financial penalties restrictions on our activities for failure to properly identify monitor and respond to potentially problematic activity and such outcomes could seriously harm our reputation our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability further allegations by regulatory or criminal authorities of improper trading activities in our markets could affect our brand and reputation and reduce the number of participants trading in our markets if that should occur we could face a corresponding decline in trading volume and revenue 

intellectual property rights licensed from thirdparty price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue material changes in the intellectual property landscape or regulatory framework pertaining to such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products 

we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products that are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from thirdparty price reporting agencies to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily susceptible to manipulation our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenues 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the us europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the us and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have patent applications pending our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights it is possible that employees or third parties may copy misappropriate or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot guarantee that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the us are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patents we could also be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we might still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 34 billion of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 23 billion 

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

• require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of cash flows to fund capital expenditures to pursue acquisitions or investments to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry or 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitors 

the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our regulated businesses are also required to maintain minimum capital requirements set by their applicable regulators 

please see item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — regulatory requirements beginning on page 45 for additional information capital requirements 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years including in connection with the global pandemic there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the past we have experienced ratings downgrades our failure to maintain our ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital additionally if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of our fixedrate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

our average rate per contract for our derivatives business is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result our average rate per contract in any particular period may not be a reliable indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract for our derivatives business which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation we cannot assure that our average rate per contract in any particular period serves as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

ten of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our derivatives exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our exchange members combined with the cme members rights to elect six directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

ten of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our exchange members in 2021 84 of our derivatives contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income and profit from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of profit that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights 

are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result members may not have the same economic interests as holders of our class a common stock in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their methods of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges and require that we maintain open outcry for options products still meeting certain volume thresholds and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our exchange members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent we have limited ability to eliminate these election rights and prior attempts to do so did not receive the necessary shareholder approvals in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options contracts we also clear futures options and swaps contracts through our clearing house futures contracts options contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global company with customer access available virtually all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers governments and central banks customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers

most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platforms these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house 

prior to september 2021 we provided optimization services that delivered transaction lifecycle management and information services to help our customers optimize their capital mitigate their risk and reduce operational costs optimization services included traiana trioptima and reset in september 2021 we contributed the net assets of our optimization business to osttra our new joint venture with ihs markit 

our clearing house clears settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges in addition to cleared swaps products our clearing houses performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies certain brokertec and ebs contracts are cleared at thirdparty clearing houses 

business trends 

economic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the federal reserve bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry competition is influenced by our brand and reputation the efficiency and security of our settlement clearing and support services depth and liquidity of our markets diversity of product offerings including frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services our ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs efficient and seamless customer experience transparency reliability anonymity and security of transaction processing the regulatory environment connectivity accessibility flexibility in execution methods and distribution and technology capability and innovation as well as overall transaction costs we believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges clearing organizations swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as markets continue to evolve we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers the competitive environment to which we are subject is discussed in item 1 business on page 10  

regulatory environment our exchangetraded derivatives exchanges and other businesses are regulated and we serve a customer base that includes regulated institutions and individuals developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly impact our business compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability the regulatory environment to which we are subject is discussed in item 1 business on page 11  

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on maximizing futures and options growth globally diversifying our business and revenues and delivering unparalleled customer efficiencies and operational excellence including through our partnership with google cloud this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes our strategic initiatives are discussed in item 1 business on page 7  

revenues 

clearing and transaction fees a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for exchangetraded and overthecounter otc contracts because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue 

• rate structure 

• product mix 

• venue and 

• the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers 

rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts fee limits and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

product mix we offer exchangetraded futures and options contracts as well as clearedonly interest rate swap contracts we also offer foreign exchange spot and forward contracts and fixed income products rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products 

venue our exchange and platforms are an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves beginning in may 2021 open outcry trading is now limited to eurodollar options and secured overnight financing rate sofr options products following the permanent closure of most of our open outcry pits 

typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

clearing and transaction fees for cash markets business  our cash markets business provides matching services whereby we match a buyer and seller of financial instruments to allow both parties to complete the trade bilaterally or through a thirdparty clearing house we are not involved in the settlement of the contract but charge a transaction fee generally based on volume or notional value of the trade for providing the matching service the cash markets business includes brokertec americas which generates revenue from a matched principal business this business serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement revenue is generated from this business generally on a transaction fee basis 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services and other various services related to our exchange operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through thirdparty distributors 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotations trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure and incentive programs for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

other revenues other revenue includes access and communication fees access and communication fees are connectivity fees charged to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services our communication services include our colocation program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers 

prior to the contribution of the net assets of our optimization business to osttra other revenues included revenues from our optimization services which included fees for risk management and information services for the otc markets including portfolio reconciliation and posttrade processing revenue earned from these services was typically generated through subscriptions or transaction fees 

other revenues also include fees for collateral management equity subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume however licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity energy and swap volumes and the majority of our employee bonuses vary indirectly with overall contract volume as bonuses are primarily based on our financial performance 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce 

the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

in general stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices 

professional fees and outside services this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives regulatory and other compliance matters temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements furniture fixtures and equipment this expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of cbot holdings inc nymex holdings inc and nex as well as other asset and business acquisitions intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm market data and other customer relationships

• technology expense consists of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology it also includes costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and some market data customers telecommunications costs of our exchange and fees paid for access to external market data this expense may be driven by system capacity functionality and redundancy requirements it also may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the us to access our electronic platforms directly 

• licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of contract volume in equity index products this expense also includes royalty fees and broker rebates on energy and metals products as well as revenue sharing on cleared swaps contracts and some new product launches this expense fluctuates with changes in contract volumes as well as changes in fee structures

critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value 

• level 1 inputs which are considered the most reliable evidence of fair value consist of quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 

• level 2 inputs consist of observable market data such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable 

• level 3 inputs consist of unobservable inputs which are derived and cannot be corroborated by market data or other entityspecific inputs 

for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and note 17 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends in addition the carrying value of goodwill as denominated in foreign currencies is adjusted each reporting period as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar such foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity 

we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the carrying value of the amortizing asset to its undiscounted net cash flows if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value in connection with this impairment assessment management also challenges the useful lives of our definitelived intangible assets on a periodic basis 

revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm a reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges this reserve has historically been immaterial the reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as managements estimate of future adjustment activity 

income taxes calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations and we occasionally may consult with relevant tax authorities or engage thirdparty expertise where appropriate we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use are capitalized we also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained in the cloud software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software which is generally two to four years but up to eight years for certain trading and clearing applications depending upon expected useful lives amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use in addition software assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable or that a reduction in the estimated useful lives is warranted

revenues 



clearing and transaction fees 

futures and options 

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract for futures and options total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain clearedonly contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures below exclude trading volume for the cash markets business as well as interest rate swaps 



we estimate the following decrease in clearing and transaction fees based on a change in total contract volume and a change in average rate per contract during 2021 compared with 2020 



average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure including volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation 

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume contract volume can be influenced by many factors including political and economic factors the regulatory environment and market competition 



in 2021 when compared with 2020 overall market volatility remained lower following periods of higher volatility in 2020 with the exception of interest rate volatility  in mid2021 the federal reserve indicated a potential increase in interest rates earlier than many market participants expected which resulted in higher volatility within the interest rate market however volatility remained lower in other markets throughout much of 2021 equity market volatility was higher in 2020 as a result of the governmental and business response to the covid19 pandemic in addition a continued rebalance and reduction in demand in the crude oil market as a result of the covid19 pandemic resulted in lower market volatility within the energy market in 2021 we believe these factors led to the changes in volume in 2021 when compared with 2020 

due to the covid19 pandemic in march 2020 we closed our open outcry trading floor and reopened it in august 2020 for eurodollar options in may 2021 we announced our decision to permanently close the trading floor outside of eurodollar options and secured overnight financing rate sofr options 

interest rate products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years   

   

1 us treasury futures and options now include respective weekly treasury options that were previously separated under a unique product category prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation 

in 2021 when compared with 2020 overall interest rate contract volume in creased due to higher overall interest rate volatility resulting from changes in market expectations we believe interest rate volatility increased following the federal reserves indication that it would maintain its zero interest rate policy in the short term and potentially raise interest rates sooner than expected in addition we believe the increase in us treasury contract volume was due to a record level of us treasury issuances which has led to an increased need for market participants to manage their risk across the treasury yield curve 

equity index products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity index products 



in 2021 when compared with 2020 equity index contract volume decreased slightly due to overall lower volatility we believe the v olatility within the broadbased indexes including the sp 500 subsided in 2021 following significant equity market volatility in early 2020 resulting from uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of governmental and business actions to combat the covid19 pandemic however there was an increase in volatility within certain narrowbased technology and small cap indexes which resulted from a market repricing of certain stocks in early 2021 we believe this increase in volatility contributed to an increase in the emini nasdaq 100 and emini russell 2000 contract volume in 2021 

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products 



overall foreign exchange contract volume decreased in 2021 when compared with 2020 which we believe is due to lower overall market volatility market volatility subsided in 2021 following very high foreign exchange volatility in early 2020 

caused by significant uncertainty surrounding the economic impacts of the governmental and business actions to combat the covid19 pandemic 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products 



in 2021 when compared with 2020 overall commodity contract volume decreased which we believe is a result of lower market volatility in the second half of 2021 m arket volatility subsided in the second half of 2021 following periods of higher volatility in 2020 and early 2021 as crop supplies met demand following the 2021 growing season and covid19 related supply chain disruptions were corrected 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products 



overall energy contract volume decreased in 2021 when compared with 2020 which we believe was a ttributable to lower overall market volatility within the energy market we believe this was due to a continued rebalance and reduction in demand in the crude oil markets as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition forecasts of warmer than expected weather resulted in a decrease in natural gas contract volume compared with 2020 we believe these factors led to the overall decrease in energy volume 

metal products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products 



lower overall market volatility within the gold and silver markets contributed to the o verall decline in metal contract volume in 2021 when compared with 2020 volatility was higher in 2020 as investors used gold and other precious metals as safehaven investments as a result of uncertainty within other markets caused by the governmental and business actions to combat the covid19 pandemic 

average rate per contract 

the average rate per contract was lower in 2021 when compared with 2020 the decrease in the average rate per contract was primarily due to a change in product mix interest rate contract volume increased by 5 percentage points as a percent of total volume while all other products collectively decreased by 5 percentage points in general interest rate products have a lower rate per contract compared with the remaining contracts 

cash markets business 

total clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2021 includes 3962 million of transaction fees attributable to the cash markets business compared with  4474 million in 2020 this revenue primarily includes brokertecss fixed income volume and ebs foreign exchange volume 



the related average daily notional value for the years ended 2021 and 2020 for key cash markets products were as follows 



overall average daily notional value for the cash markets business increased slightly in 2021 when compared with 2020 the increase in european repo transactions was largely due to increased volatility as a result of the european union unexpectedly leaving interest rates unchanged we believe the decreases in us treasury and spot fx volumes are primarily due to lower levels of volatility following periods of higher volatility in early 2020 caused by significant uncertainty surrounding the economic impacts of the governmental and business actions to combat the covid19 pandemic despite the increase in average daily notional value transaction revenue decreased due to the tiered pricing structure and incentive rate programs 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one clearing firm represented approximately 10 of our clearing and transaction fees in 2021 should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trad ing activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm 

other sources of revenue 

market data and information services in 2021 when compared with 2020 the increase in market data and information services revenue was largely attributable to an increase in certain device fees 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented in aggregate approximately 34 of our market data and information services revenue in 2021 despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 

other revenues the decrease in other revenues in 2021 when compared with 2020 was largely attributable to the deconsolidation of the optimization business in september 2021 as part of the contribution of the businesss net assets to osttra our joint venture with ihs markit 

expenses 



2021 compared with 2020 

operating expenses decreased by 2017 million in 2021 when compared with 2020 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the net decrease in operating expenses 



overall operating expenses decreased in 2021 when compared with 2020 due to the following reasons 

• amortization of purchased intangibles was lower in 2021 as intangible assets related to cme groups optimization business were contributed to osttra a joint venture with ihs markit in september 2021 amortization was no longer taken on these intangible assets once they were classified as held for sale in january 2021 following approval of the contribution by the companys board of directors 

• professional fees and outside services expenses decreased due to a greater reliance on consultants for platform integrations information security and systems enhancements in 2020 as well as a reduction in legal fees related to our business activities and product offerings 

• salaries benefits and employer taxes were lower during 2021 when compared to 2020 due to higher reductions in workforce and the contribution of employees from cme groups optimization businesses to the new joint venture with ihs markit in september 2021 

• in 2020 we recognized higher impairment charges on certain intangible assets and fixed assets related to a subsidiary 

• decreases in stockbased compensation expense were primarily due to higher forfeitures resulting from reductions in headcount compared to 2020 

increases in operating expenses in 2021 when compared with 2020 were as follows 

• employee separation and retention costs were higher during 2021 due to a higher reduction in workforce compared to 2020 

• bonus expenses increased in 2021 largely due to performance relative to our 2021 cash earnings target when compared with 2020 performance relative to our 2020 cash earnings target 

nonoperating income expense   

nm not meaningful 

investment income the increase in investment income in 2021 when compared with 2020 was largely due to higher net unrealized and realized gains on investments of 1225 million 

equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries higher income generated from our spdji business venture contributed to an increase in equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2021 when compared with 2020 in september 2021 we also began recognizing our share of net earnings in our investment in osttra our new joint venture with ihs markit 

other income expense in 2021 we recognized a net gain of 4007 million on the deconsolidation and contribution of our optimization business to osttra which contributed to an increase in other income in 2021 we also recognized a gain of 304 million related to the sale of a building in chicago in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as proceeds from a legal settlement 

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 



the effective tax rate decreased in 2021 when compared with 2020 in 2021 we recognized a gain on the deconsolidation and contribution of our optimization business to osttra which was not taxable the decrease due to the gain was partially offset by an increase to the statutory rate in the united kingdom 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

we have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations however we have used our commercial paper program from time to time to fund large shortterm funding needs including our acquisition of nex in 2018 while our cost structure is generally fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels in addition to using our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations we may continue to utilize our commercial paper program to meet our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments it is also possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities 

cash will also be required for noncancellable purchase obligations as at december 31 2021 commitments include material contractual purchase obligations that are noncancellable purchase obligations relate to advertising licensing hardware software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services aside from the table below we have certain other arrangements that have a perpetual term for which we pay 50 million per year at december 31 2021 future minimum payments due under purchase obligations were payable as follows in millions 



future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity performance improvements integration of acquired platforms and improvements to some of our office spaces each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and modification of our offices remote data centers telecommunications network and other operating equipment in 2022 we expect capital expenditures to total approximately 1400 million to 1500 million net of any leasehold improvement allowances we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders with a target of between 50 to 60 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant we are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of our state of incorporation which could limit our ability to declare and pay dividends on february 3 2022 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 100 per share for all outstanding common and preferred shares the dividend will be payable on march 25 2022 to shareholders of record on march 10 2022 assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately 3630 million the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 325 per share on december 9 2021 paid on january 14 2022 to the shareholders of record on december 28 2021 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results capital expenditures potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

sources and uses of cash 

the following is a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was lower in 2021 compared with 2020 largely due to a decrease in clearing and transaction fee revenue and other revenue we also contributed the operating net assets of the optimization business to osttra in the third quarter of 2021 which resulted in a net decrease in operating cash flow in addition our income tax payments were higher in 2021 compared with 2020 

investing activities 

the increase in cash provided by investing activities in 2021 compared with 2020 was largely due to the net cash received from the osttra joint venture transaction of  1007 million and the additional proceeds received from sales of investments in 2021 in addition our purchases of fixed assets were lower in 2021 when compared with 2020 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities was higher in 2021 when compared with 2020 mainly due to an increase in cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions in addition we received proceeds of  9650 million from the issuance of 

preferred shares in connection with our partnership with google cloud the increase in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a reduction in the amount of outstanding commercial paper in 2020 for discussion regarding the revision of the presentation of the consolidated statements of cash flow to include cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 

debt instruments 

the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2021

liquidity and cash management 

cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash totaled 28 billion and 16 billion at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our corporate investment policy and alternative investment choices a majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in us treasury securities us government agency securities and us treasury security reverse repurchase agreements and shortterm bank deposits our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that no additional contribution will be necessary in 2022 to meet our funding goal however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on various factors including the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2022 and the december 31 2022 discount rate

we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2021 consisted of fixedrate borrowings of 34 billion in us dollar equivalent changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixedrate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows we did not have any variablerate borrowings at december 31 2021 

credit risk 

cme clearing house 

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through thirdparty exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for exchangetraded and interest rate swaps products for clearing firms we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk we establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity we marktomarket open positions of clearing firms at least once a day twice a day for futures and options contracts and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value we have the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant these practices allow our clearing house to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity 

despite our safeguards we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

we maintain two separate financial safeguard packages 

• a financial safeguard package for all futures options and overthecounter swap contracts other than cleared interest rate swap contracts base package and 

• a financial safeguard package for cleared interest rate swap contracts 

in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for clearing membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit 

we maintain a 70 billion 364day multicurrency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or us treasury securities performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day multicurrency line of credit we also have the option to use our 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default 

at december 31 2021 aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for both financial safeguard packages was  2248 billion including cash performance bond deposits noncash deposits interest earnings facility funds and letters of credit a defaulting firms performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm 

the following shows the available assets at december 31 2021 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets 



 

1 our clearing house designates 1000 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firms guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit 

2 guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms include guaranty fund contributions required of clearing firms but do not include any excess deposits held by us at the direction of clearing firms 

3 in the event of a clearing firm default if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm our corporate contribution and the nondefaulting clearing firms guaranty fund contributions we would assess all nondefaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the guaranty fund we could assess nondefaulting clearing members 275 of their existing guaranty fund requirements up to a maximum of 550 of their existing guaranty fund requirements as provided in the rules assessment powers are calculated to reflect the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for in the event clearing member defaults exhaust the guaranty fund however the total amount available would be reduced by the defaulted clearing members assessment obligations since they would no longer be able to satisfy their obligations 

the following shows the available assets for the interest rate swap financial safeguard package at december 31 2021 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears interest rate swap contracts after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets 



 

1 our clearing house designates 1500 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firms guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit 

2 guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms for interest rate swap contracts include guaranty fund contributions required of those clearing firms 

3 in the event of a clearing firm default if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm our corporate contribution and the nondefaulting firms guaranty fund contributions we would assess nondefaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the interest rate swap guaranty fund assessment powers are calculated to reflect the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for based on potential failure of the third and fourth largest clearing 

brokertec americas matched principal business 

brokertec americas maintains a matched principal business where it serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement brokertec americas uses fixed income clearing corporation ficc a thirdparty central clearing house as well as a thirdparty clearing bank for the settlement of transactions and is required to post shortterm margin requirements twice a day that can vary based on the size of unsettled transactions and any adverse market changes at december 31 2021 the balance of the collateral at ficc was  1000 million which was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 

without sufficient funds to meet its obligations brokertec americas could be exposed to risk of breach of contract with the counterparties and the inability to continue as a member of the thirdparty central clearing house transactions with clearing house members are typically confirmed and novated shortly after execution at which point the clearing house assumes the risk of settlement for transactions with counterparties that are not members of the thirdparty clearing house settlement typically occurs on the day following execution and prior to settlement brokertec americas is exposed to the risk of loss in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations if that were to occur brokertec americas would have the right to cover or liquidate the open position but could incur a loss as a result of market movements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on monetary assets liabilities revenues and expenses held at subsidiaries where those balances and activity are denominated in a currency other than the subsidiarys functional currency gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result primarily from cash debt and other monetary assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in british pounds euros and japanese yen 

aggregate transaction gains losses for 2021 2020 and 2019 were 04 million 93 million and 72 million respectively we expect the foreign currency gainloss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold monetary assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries market uncertainty could potentially lead to significant volatility with foreign currency exchange rates which could result in additional foreign currency gainloss 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets liabilities revenues and expenses from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we report on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income the financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income aggregate translation gains losses net of tax for 2021 2020 and 2019 were 620 million 1343 million and 06 million respectively 

foreign currency exchange risk related to customer collateral 

a portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in various foreign currencies we marktomarket all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price therefore our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive has seen multiple new entrants over time and we expect competition to continue to intensify and become more global especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank european market infrastructure regulation emir emir 22 markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii capital requirements directive iv market abuse regulation benchmarks regulation basel iii and various other laws and regulations 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 15 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties 

competition in our derivatives exchange business 

we believe competition in the derivatives business is based on a number of factors including among others 

• brand and reputation 

• efficient and secure settlement clearing and support services 

• depth and liquidity of markets 

• diversity of product offerings and frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services 

• ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs 

• efficient and seamless customer experience 

• transparency reliability anonymity and security in transaction processing 

• regulatory environment 

• connectivity accessibility flexibility in execution methods and distribution 

• technological capability and innovation and 

• overall transaction costs 

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse and complementary product offerings frequency and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from others in the industry we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop and offer new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability functionality and security maintain liquidity and low transaction costs continue to strengthen our risk management capabilities and solutions and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers 

we compete in a large and expanding financial services trading clearing and settlement marketplace globally our competitors include among other entities exchanges such as intercontinental exchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited and deutsche börse ag competition also includes alternative means of developing exposures through alternative instruments depending on market factors such as cash otc etfs options warrants contracts for differences structured products and other offerings and incorporates large customer and channel internalization of trade flows and data new emerging competitors have targeted different segments of our industry with multiple execution models and products and emerging technologies will continue to offer additional alternative products in the future competition in our industry continues to be dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business 

competition in our cme clearing business 

in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with compliance with doddfrank emir 22 basel iii mifid ii and other various laws and regulations 

our competitors in the clearing services space include among others companies such as ice lch group the options clearing corporation depository trust  clearing corporation hong kong exchanges and clearing japan securities clearing corporation lme clearing and deutsche börse ag in light of the implementation of new regulatory requirements and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may 

undertake to provide clearing and other related posttrade services such as nodel and eris in the us as cftc regulated designated clearing organizations 

we believe competition in clearing services is based on among other things the value of providing customers with capital and margin efficiencies quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house regulatory costs timely delivery of the services reputation diversity of the service offerings confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the fees charged for the services provided 

competition in our cash markets business 

the cash markets businesses face substantial competition across a wide array of venues in the fx space the marketplace is highly fragmented and there is competition from other electronic communication networks single dealer platforms bankowned multiparticipant platforms streaming and request for quote services trading venues tied to data platforms voice brokers other broker enabled platforms and other venues there is a growing array of platforms and technologies and they are often owned by many wellcapitalized financial institutions and intermediaries that are also driving internalization of client fx trade flows in the fixed income space there are also multiple providers of treasury european and us repo and european bond trading as well as other products such as corporate bonds municipal bonds mortgagebacked bonds and agencies and a multitude of competitors and new entrants offering singledealer liquidity bankowned multiparticipant platforms streaming and request for quote services and other broker and exchangeenabled platforms 

competition in our optimization services business 

the optimization services business faces substantial competition across each of the segments in which cme group operates there are multiple providers of compression services reconciliation services trade processing analytics and regulatory reporting services in addition there is considerable innovation occurring in this business with new entrants and new technologies being developed to serve customers and differentiate offerings competition also comes from other clearing houses and exchange groups who are today internalizing or have plans to internalize various services as well as existing back office service providers who may embed these services in their offerings 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products although we may receive license fees for such products such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable product 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are regulated and serve a customerbase that includes regulated institutions or individuals developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly affect our businesses as such we are subject to extensive regulation primarily in the us and europe 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom uk formally withdrew from the european union eu after a majority of voters in the uk approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit as a result of brexit we have established certain businesses in amsterdam an eu jurisdiction which will allow us to continue to provide services to eu clients we have also entered into agreements to work with eubased clearing venues to clear eu based repo traded products additionally amendments to emir 22 became effective during 2020 which resulted in changes to the eu equivalence and recognition regime for noneu clearing houses including cme clearing the european commission adopted several implementing and delegated acts relating to central counterparties established in third countries under the emir 22 revisions to the european market infrastructure regulation 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 15 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties 

regulation of our derivatives business cme clearing and our sef 

our operation of us futures exchanges cme clearing and our sef is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc that requires our regulated subsidiaries to satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures and swaps markets and clearing houses in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank 

regulations implementing doddfrank include rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain otc derivatives swap reporting operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting product definitions the 

definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets swap execution facilities and swap data repositories 

cme has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization these designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities by the cftc and the federal reserve board 

in connection with the global offering of our products and clearing services this business is also subject to the rules and regulations of the local jurisdictions in which we conduct business including the european securities and markets authority esma the uk financial conduct authority fca and bank of england and the netherlands authority for the financial markets afm 

regulation of our cash markets business

regulation of our market data business 

a portion of our market data business offered by cme group benchmark administration is subject to regulation by the eu benchmarks regulation which regulates our repofunds rate suite of daily euro repo indices 

key areas of focus 

we actively monitor and participate in the domestic and international rulemaking processes for our industry including providing government testimony commenting on proposed rulemaking and educating our regulators on potential impacts to the marketplace we are also focused on the new us presidential administration and any anticipated changes that may result 

our key areas of focus in the regulatory environment are 

• the potential impact of the adoption of emir 22 allowing for the direct regulation by the eu of noneu clearing houses like ours and resulting changes to the eu equivalence and recognition regime on noneu clearing houses and exchanges with customers based in europe emir 22 became effective on january 1 2020 and as of december 31 2020 we do not anticipate a significant impact to our business 

• rules respecting capital charges under basel iii with respect to clearing members of central counterparties may have negative implications for the cleared derivatives markets additional risks could arise through inconsistent adoption of the basel iii capital charges globally potentially leading to disparate impacts on our customers 

• the potential for further regulation stemming from industry performance disruptions and residual concerns around electronic trading activity and in particular high frequency trading 

• the potential elimination of the 6040 tax treatment of certain of our futures and options contracts which would result in 60 of the gains being taxed at the shortterm capital gain rate instead of the longterm capital gain rate this would impose a significant increase in tax rates applicable to certain market participants and could result in a decrease in their trading activity 

• the implementation of a transaction tax or user fee in the us uk or eu or in the states of illinois or new jersey which could discourage institutions and individuals from using our markets or products or encourage them to trade in another less costly jurisdiction legislation to impose a financial transaction tax has been proposed in the us congress illinois general assembly and state of new jersey legislature in the last legislative sessions and could be proposed again in the current legislative sessions additionally from time to time the proposed us presidential budget request has included a proposal to impose a user fee to fund all or a portion of the budget of the cftc 

• certain provisions in relation to the eu regulations on benchmarks came into effect on january 1 2018 and prices and data provided by cme group for use by eu supervised entities and use of those benchmarks may be impacted on november 30 2020 the european commission european parliament and the council agreed to postpone application of the rules on third country benchmarks until december 31 2023 as a result all prices and data provided by cme group are available for use by eu supervised entities throughout the transition period until january 1 2023 subject to entering into appropriate licensing arrangements where relevant the implementation of legislation in the eu impacting how benchmark index prices are formed including new requirements for price submitters price aggregators and markets that list contracts that reference index prices 

• concerns that european legislators will prohibit or restrict exclusive licenses for benchmark indexes which might impact the profitability of several of our most popular contracts 

• the fca has indicated that it will no longer require banks to participate in the libor panel after december 31 2021 the possibility exists that the fca may find libor to not be representative of the underlying shortterm interest rate pricing or unfit for such purpose and thus may unfavorably impact our ability to list our existing suite of eurodollar futures and options products 

• the implementation of rules resulting in negative treatment of the liquidity profile of us treasury securities including as qualifying liquidity resources or any potential limitation on the use of us treasury securities as collateral could result in increased costs to us and our clearing firms 

• the implementation of the final phases of uncleared margin rules umr phase 5  6 across jurisdictions and implications for customers management of exposures

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of global market economic and political conditions that are beyond our control and that could significantly impact our business and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets the trading volumes in our markets are directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

• economic political and geopolitical market conditions 

• legislative and regulatory changes including any direct or indirect restrictions on or increased costs associated with trading in our markets or our clearing services 

• broad trends in the industry and financial markets 

• changes in price levels trading volumes and volatility in the derivatives cash and otc markets and in their underlying markets 

• shifts in demand or supply in commodities underlying our products 

• competition 

• changes in government monetary policies including central bank decisions related to quantitative easing and the us federal reserve and other international banks forecasted commitment to zero or nearzero interest rates 

• availability of capital to our market participants and their appetite for risktaking 

• levels of assets under our customers management 

• volatile weather patterns droughts natural disasters and other catastrophes 

• pandemics affecting our customer base or our ability to operate our markets and 

• consolidation or expansion in our customer base and within our industry 

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility however as evidenced by our past performance in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital the shifts in market trading patterns we experienced as a result of the financial crisis of 2008 may or may not recur in the future and our business will be affected by future economic uncertainties which may result in decreased trading volume and a more challenging business environment for us we believe that our interest rate product line will continue to be negatively impacted by the current state of the economy and a zerointerest rate policy a reduction in overall trading volume or in certain products could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenue material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

please see item 1a  risk factors  risks relating to our business beginning on page 19 for additional information 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business and our failure to maintain compliance with regulations our status as a regulated entity or brokertec americas status as a member in good standing at ficc could result in the loss of customers 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the us uk and europe as a result of our global operations we are also subject to the rules and regulations of other local jurisdictions in which we conduct business and offer our products and services as appropriate 

due to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 the us and numerous other jurisdictions have undertaken reviews of the legal framework governing financial markets and have either enacted new laws rules and regulations or are in the process of enacting new laws rules and regulations that could impact our business we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with the extensive regulations that apply to our business 

additional new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed in the us or other jurisdictions which could change or require us to change our business practices or the structure of our business including its current governance structure or impose significant costs on us by for example requiring more of our funds to be set aside for the guaranty fund this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients overall trading volume and demand for our market data and other services additionally regulations imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally may adversely impact their trading activity in our markets to the extent the legislative and regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

legislation may be proposed both domestically and internationally that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets if such proposals were to become law they could have a negative impact on our industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading and could make our markets less competitive 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market derivatives clearing organization swap execution facility swap data repository or brokerdealer or other regulatory penalties 

our brokerdealer and multilateral trading facility businesses brokertec and ebs are also extensively regulated in various jurisdictions these regulatory obligations generally include proper licensing and qualification of the firms and individuals substantive conduct standards communication and disclosure rules monitoring and surveillance training capital requirements supervisory obligations maintenance of antimoney laundering programs suspicious activity reporting risk management standards trade reporting and ongoing examinations and reviews the risks from failing to comply with these regulatory obligations include potential liability disciplinary action against the firm and individuals monetary penalties and restrictions on future activities 

brokertec americas matched principal platform facilitates anonymous trading in significant volumes from wholesale market participants many of which are ficc members and understand that brokertec americas is also a ficc member such that their trades are expected to be novated promptly to ficc which will be their ultimate counterparty a failure of brokertec americas to maintain its membership could adversely impact the willingness of such participants to continue trading on our platform as part of maintaining its ficc membership brokertec americas is required to timely and fully meet all margin calls and other obligations established by ficc and as such must maintain ready access to sufficient liquidity to satisfy those obligations brokertec americas maintains access to liquidity resources it believes will satisfy these obligations in normal and stressed circumstances but there can be no guarantee it will never experience a shortfall 

please see item 1  business  regulatory matters beginning on page 11 for additional information on our areas of regulatory focus 

some of cme clearings largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

our clearing house seeks to offer customers intermediaries and clearing firms universal access in order to maximize the efficient use of capital exercise appropriate oversight of value at risk and maintain operating leverage from clearing activities on our exchanges our strategic business plan for our futures and options business is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business some of our clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions of futures or options from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our revenues and profits could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition from other companies if we are not able to successfully compete our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and in some cases operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges otc markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large industry participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others our competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do 

our competitors may 

• respond more quickly to competitive pressures including responses based upon their corporate governance structures which may be more flexible and efficient than our corporate governance structure 

• develop products that are preferred by our customers compared to those offered by cme group 

• develop risk transfer products that compete with our products 

• price their products and services more competitively 

• develop and expand their network infrastructure and service offerings more efficiently 

• utilize better more userfriendly or more reliable technology 

• take greater advantage of acquisitions alliances and other opportunities that provide a competitive advantage 

• more effectively market promote and sell their products and services 

• better leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners or exploit better recognized brand names to market and sell their services or 

• exploit regulatory disparities between traditional regulated exchanges and alternative markets that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lowercost business model 

if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected a decline in our fees or loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

please see item 1  business  competition beginning on page 10 for additional information on the competitive environment and its potential impact on our business 

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers at substantially similar trading levels or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase trading volume in our markets to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution facilities our preand posttrade 

services and clearing facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies in the past such as lowering the fees they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity payments or rebates we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to expand our products and services that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin 

our clearing firm clients must meet certain capital requirements and must deposit collateral to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements there is no guarantee the collateral deposited will continue to maintain its value to the extent a clearing firm were to experience a decrease in capital and be unable to meet requirements it may be required to decrease its trading activity 

additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts and a substantial decrease in their trading activity could have a negative impact on the liquidity of the particular product line or contract 

if we fail to maintain trading volume as a result of a loss of customers or decrease in trading activity expand our product offerings or execution facilities or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected declines in trading volume may also negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of trading volume because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis and our profitability could be adversely affected 

our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyber security threats which could result in wrongful use of our data or our customers’ data or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in substantial liabilities we also could be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems andor investigate any alleged attack 

we regard the secure storage and transmission of data and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to targeted attacks such as phishing attacks unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism ransom attacks firewall or encryption failures or other security risks criminal groups political activist groups and nationstate actors have targeted the financial services industry in general and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other information security threats while we have not experienced cyber incidents that are individually or in the aggregate material we have experienced cyber attacks of varying degrees in the past our usage of mobile and cloud technologies may increase our risk for a cyber attack our security defenses may also be impacted or breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our technology systems and data or our customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the services we provide that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while resulting in regulatory penalties or the imposition of additional obligations by regulators or others as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous and complex any failure to comply may carry significant penalties and reputational damage 

we have designed our cyber defense program to mitigate such attacks and security risks through administrative physical and technical safeguards as part of our global information security and privacy programs we employ resources to prevent detect and respond to cyberattacks and security risks that could impact our people processes and technology infrastructure including the rapid response to zeroday vulnerabilities however our security measures or those of our thirdparty providers including any cloudbased technologies may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed any security attack or breach could result in system failures and delays malfunctions in our operations loss of customers or lower trading volume loss of competitive position damage to our reputation disruption of our business legal liability or regulatory fines and significant costs which in turn may cause our revenues and earnings to decline though we have insurance against some cyber and privacy risks and attacks we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and regulatory liability and penalties 

many aspects of our business present substantial litigation risks these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction or that we failed to effectively fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities we may be subject to disputes regarding the quality of trade execution the settlement of trades or other matters relating to our services we may become subject to these claims as a 

result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation to the extent we are found to have failed to fulfill our regulatory obligations we could lose our authorizations or licenses or become subject to conditions that could make future operations more costly and impair our profitability such events could also result in customer dissatisfaction and a decline in their willingness to trade on our markets 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism which poses physical security risks and cybersecurity risks than other companies 

given our role in the global financial services industry we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on our industry generally or on our business while we have implemented significant physical security protection measures business continuity plans and established backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such an attack may result in harm to our personnel the closure of our facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance coverage available or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks also may negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to our business 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economy including the us economy and the global financial markets and has disrupted our business and that of our clients’ businesses the ultimate impact from covid19 including duration is unknown and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the ongoing covid19 health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and us economies and financial markets the spread of covid19 has caused illness quarantines cancellation of events and travel business and school shutdowns reduction in business activity and financial transactions labor shortages supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability in the us similar impacts also have been experienced throughout the world including in every country in which we do business given the unique and unpredictable nature of this event future impacts to our business are unknown and could be material those impacts may include among others the following 

• continued disruption to our business and operations 

• key members of senior management or a significant number of our employees unable to work as a result of contracting covid19 or related illnesses 

• reduced productivity and operating effectiveness as a result of our employees working remotely and impacts on our clients encountering similar circumstances 

• impacts on our thirdparty suppliers and their ability to fulfill their obligations to us 

• decreased trading volume and unprecedented market stresses in global financial markets 

• changes in demand for our products and services based upon fiscal monetary and trade policies adopted in response to the economic impact of the pandemic 

• reduced economic activity generally could cause businesses to have less need to hedge in our markets 

• delays in our expansion investment and strategic initiatives and system integrations 

• impacts to our ability to expand our client base grow our business and generate new revenue due to the inability to hold inperson meetings events and conferences and other impacts from social distancing 

• impacts on our brand and reputation due to negative investor sentiment in the overall financial markets 

• increased financial and operational stress experienced by our clearing firm members due to unprecedented volatility including significant losses that may result in a reduction of business or a default 

• market access or trading limitations imposed by governmental authorities and 

• increased technology and cybersecurity risks social engineering and phishing campaigns 

these potential impacts may exist for a significant period of time and may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided 

in the past year we have experienced an overall decrease in trading volume which we believe is in part a result of effects of the covid19 pandemic additionally the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting employee travel and continuing workfromhome protocols and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees and clients we also closed our open outcry trading floor and trading is now conducted almost entirely through our electronic trading system in august 2020 the eurodollar options pit was reopened after being reconfigured to meet social distancing standards with additional safety standards in place there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic further impacts our business results of operations or financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict but may include among others the duration and spread of the pandemic its severity the actions taken by governments and other third parties to contain the virus or treat its impact such as vaccination and the effect of such actions on our business practices including ending workfromhome protocols the impact of existing and any future federal stimulus measures and the pace at which and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume or even if they resume whether such economic and operating conditions can be sustained 

in addition many of the other risk factors described herein could be heightened by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related economic conditions which could result in a material impact on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

damage to our reputation could harm our business 

maintaining our reputation and brand is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and to maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services including social and environmental concerns relating to certain commodity products and increased impact from climate change or criticism or market reaction to the performance of our market in periods of extreme volatility could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our business prospects these issues may include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a including risks from customer disputes system failures or intrusions failures to meet our regulatory obligations failures of a clearing firm or other counterparty issues relating to our thirdparty suppliers alleged or actual fraud or misconduct or manipulative activity or ineffective risk management 

the success of our markets depends on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading and clearing systems that have the functionality performance availability capacity security and speed required by our customers 

the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces for a wide range of products that have the required functionality performance availability capacity security and speed to attract and retain customers in 2020 94 of our overall contract volume was generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform and we generated 3525 million in revenue attributable to the brokertec and ebs trading platforms 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platforms and other technology offerings to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

• provide reliable and costeffective services to our customers 

• develop in a timely manner the required functionality to support electronic trading in a manner that is competitive with the functionality supported by other electronic markets 

• maintain the competitiveness of our fee structure 

• attract independent software vendors to write frontend software that will effectively access our electronic trading systems and automated order routing system 

• respond to technological developments or service offerings by competitors and 

• generate sufficient revenue to justify the substantial capital investment we have made and will continue to make to enhance our electronic trading platforms and other technology offerings 

if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading systems and technology offerings if we are unable to develop them to include other products and markets or if they do not have the required functionality performance availability capacity security and speed desired by our customers our ability to successfully compete and our revenues and profits will be adversely affected although we are focused on the technology and customer experience as part of the migration of the brokertec platform to cme globex in the first quarter of 2021 and the expected migration of the ebs platform to cme globex in the 

fourth quarter of 2021 we cannot guarantee that we will not experience any client attrition and to the extent any such client attrition is significant it could have an impact on our revenues 

additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

our business is highly dependent on our ability to process execute and monitor in an efficient and uninterrupted manner a large number of transactions which occur at high volumes and frequencies across multiple systems and our ability to access key business data financial information order processing and invoicing we are heavily reliant on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology and communications and other business systems and software supporting our operations our systems or those of our thirdparty providers including cloud providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

• unanticipated disruptions in service to our customers 

• slower response times and delays in our customers trade execution and processing 

• failed settlement of trades 

• incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades 

• financial losses 

• security breaches 

• litigation or other customer claims 

• loss of customers or 

• regulatory sanctions 

we cannot assure that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failures acts of god war or terrorism human error on our part or on the part of our vendors natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyber attacks acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems or the systems of our thirdparty providers do not operate properly are compromised or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platforms and technology offerings or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impact our trading volumes impair our reputation damage our brand result in regulatory fines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

regulations relating to our trading and clearing systems generally require the handling of anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause them to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in volume however we cannot assure that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of our platforms system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead our regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and as we execute our business strategy although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing 

volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected 

we as well as many of our customers depend on thirdparty suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies internet service providers data processors cloud hosting providers data center providers and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our trading platforms and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services or provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased trading volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our business exposes us to substantial credit risk of our clearing firms and other counterparties and consequently a decrease in their financial resources could adversely affect us 

our clearing house operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles we routinely guarantee transactions submitted by our clearing firm customers with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one or more of our clearing firms additionally we are exposed to the risk of loss from the failure of a matched principal counterparty to settle its trades at brokertec americas 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations additionally brokertec americas is exposed to the potential risk of loss in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms and other counterparties can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a fund currently 980 million to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to qualified family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances if their clearing firm becomes insolvent 

our threemonth eurodollar futures contracts are based on the threemonth us dollar london interbank offered rate libor underlying rate to the extent trading in eurodollar contracts decreases or is discontinued and our alternative contracts are not successful our revenues would be negatively impacted certain of our other businesses could also be negatively affected by changes to libor 

our eurodollar futures contract is based on the threemonth us dollar ice libor underlying rate in 2020 average trading volume in our eurodollar contracts was 31 million contracts and open interest was 324 million contracts libor is the subject of national and international proposals for reform which advocate for the transition of survey based interbank offered rates to alternative transactionbased reference rates a transition from the widespread use of libor to alternative benchmark rates is likely to occur over the next several years the uk fca which regulates libor has announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions has recommended replacing us dollar libor with other benchmark alternatives such as sofr it is unknown whether these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for libor in october 2020 central banking counterparties revised the discounting and price alignment interest pai of usdollar cleared interest rate swaps to use sofr this event affected interest rate swaps including auctions of newly created sofr basis swaps and increased liquidity for sofr and the resulting orderly auctions 

on november 30 2020 ice benchmark administration iba announced a consultation on its intention to cease the publication of certain libor rates including its intention to cease the publication of the threemonth us dollar libor on june 30 2023 the uk fca also announced its proposed approach to ensure an orderly winddown of libor and has supported publication of threemonth us dollar libor tenor in a representative manner through june 30 2023 the us federal reserve office of comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance company also issued a statement 

encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use us dollar libor as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by december 31 2021 

any transition away from libor to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we have closely engaged with the industry regulators and market participants to launch products using alternative reference rates including our sofr and sterling overnight index average sonia futures contracts while these actions have resulted in an increase in market acceptance of sofr there is no guarantee that this transition will be successful or replace the revenue we derive from our eurodollar contracts if trading volume were to decline or discontinue altogether 

our market data revenues may be reduced by decreased demand poor overall economic conditions regulatory changes or a significant change in how market participants trade and use market data 

we offer a wide range of data services designed to support the trading risk management investment and business needs of our global customer base revenues from our market data and information services represented 11 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively factors that may affect our performance and demand for our data include but are not limited to 

• our ability to maintain existing customers utilizing our data and to attract new customers with our products and services 

• a decrease in overall trading volume which may lead to a decreased demand for our market data 

• a challenging business environment for our customers which may require them to reduce their usage of our market data 

• the impacts of new regulations laws rules or other government policies 

• our ability to ensure that customers are appropriately licensed and are paying fees for the data used 

• the protection of our intellectual property rights and identification of misappropriation andor misuses of cme group market data and 

• our ability to keep pace with technological developments and client preferences 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the otc markets and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances our growth strategy also may subject us to increased legal compliance and regulatory obligations unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions other investments and strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of historical merger and acquisition activity in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us which could impact our ability to identify growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially 

the process of integration also may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter 

potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from our growth initiatives and investments which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we also may be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively affect our stock price our acquisition of nex is subject to many of these risks including the potential we may not achieve the expected cost savings synergies and other strategic benefits from the transaction within the anticipated time frames and the integration of nex with our operations may not be successful or may be delayed or more costly than expected or that we may experience customer attrition 

the expansion of our global operations is complex and subjects us to increased business and economic risks that could adversely affect our financial results 

in connection with our expanded global operations we face certain risks inherent in doing business internationally these risks include 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• complying with extensive and complex regulations and oversight 

• difficulties in staffing and associated costs in managing multiple international locations 

• general economic social and political conditions 

• protectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in some countries 

• reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 

• language and cultural differences and 

• potentially adverse tax consequences 

if we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully or if the risks above become substantial for us our financial performance and operating results could suffer further any measures we may implement to reduce risks of our international operations may not be effective may increase our expenses and may require significant management time and effort 

as our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements from local currencies into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore any increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

the brexit transition period between the uk and eu ended in december 2020 and the euuk trade and cooperation agreement provisionally entered into force on january 1 2021 as a result of brexit we have established certain cme group businesses in amsterdam an eu jurisdiction which allows these businesses to continue offering products and services to customers in the eu however this has resulted in and may continue to result in increased legal compliance and operational costs 

our risk management and compliance programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators including during regulatory examinations and we are subject to their inquiry and oversight our regulators have broad enforcement and supervisory powers including the power to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our regulatory designations or the registration of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to manage our risks and comply with applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of effective risk management compliance and monitoring programs in the case of alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

we maintain risk management and compliance policies procedures and programs which are designed to prevent detect deter monitor and manage our risks but such policies procedures and programs may not be fully effective some of our risk management processes depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers employees or other matters or potential threats that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal and compliance regulatory reputational and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large 

number of transactions and events we cannot guarantee that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct or manipulative activity by employees of financial services firms and other market participants in the past improper trading activity on our platforms by participants could include activities such as spoofing layering wash trading and manipulation misconduct by our employees and agents could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or the company or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of data or confidential information of the company or its customers 

it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases if we were found to have not met our regulatory oversight and compliance obligations we could be subject to regulatory sanctions financial penalties restrictions on our activities for failure to properly identify monitor and respond to potentially problematic activity and seriously harm our reputation our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability further allegations by regulatory or criminal authorities of improper trading activities could affect our brand and reputation and reduce the number of participants trading in our markets if that should occur we could face a corresponding decline in trading volume and revenue 

intellectual property rights licensed from thirdparty price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue material changes in the intellectual property landscape or regulatory framework pertaining to such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products 

we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from thirdparty price reporting agencies to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily susceptible to manipulation our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenues 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the us europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the us and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have patent applications pending our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy misappropriate or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example one of our former employees pleaded guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot guarantee that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the us are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patents we could also be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we might still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 34 billion of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 24 billion 

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

• require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing the availability of cash flows to fund capital expenditures to pursue acquisitions or investments to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry or 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitors 

the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our us exchanges swap execution facility and clearing house also are required to maintain minimum capital levels as defined by the cftc and brokertec americas is required to meet minimum capital requirements set by the sec 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years including in connection with the global pandemic there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the past we have experienced ratings downgrades our failure to maintain our ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital additionally if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of our fixedrate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

our average rate per contract for our derivatives business is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result our average rate per contract in any particular period may not be a reliable indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract for our derivatives business which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation we cannot assure that our average rate per contract in any particular period serves as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

eleven of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our derivatives exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our exchange members combined with the cme members rights to elect six directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

eleven of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our exchange members in 2020 83 of our derivatives contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income and profit from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of profit that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights 

are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result members may not have the same economic interests as holders of our class a common stock in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their methods of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges and require that we maintain open outcry for options products still meeting certain volume thresholds and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our exchange members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent we have limited ability to eliminate these election rights in 2018 we held a special meeting of shareholders to eliminate all or some of these director election rights while the proposal received majority support it failed to achieve the required support under delaware law from a majority of the outstanding owners of the class b common stock in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

our class b common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized overthecounter market each class of our class b common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our cme exchange cmes rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights each share of our class b common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights

our clearing house clears settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges in addition to cleared swaps products our clearing houses performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies certain brokertec and ebs contracts are cleared at thirdparty clearing houses 

business trends 

economic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the federal reserve bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry competition is influenced by our brand and reputation the efficiency and security of our settlement clearing and support services depth and liquidity of our markets diversity of product offerings including frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services our ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs efficient and seamless customer experience transparency reliability anonymity and security of transaction processing the regulatory environment connectivity accessibility flexibility in execution methods and distribution technology capability and innovation as well as overall transaction costs we believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges clearing organizations swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as markets continue to evolve we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers the competitive environment to which we are subject is discussed in item 1 business on page 10 

regulatory environment exchangetraded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly impact our business compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability the regulatory environment to which we are subject is discussed in item 1 business on page 11 

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on maximizing futures and options growth globally diversifying our business and revenues and delivering unparalleled customer efficiencies and operational excellence this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes our strategic initiatives are discussed in item 1 business on page 7 

revenues 

clearing and transaction fees a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for exchangetraded and overthecounter contracts because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue 

• rate structure 

• product mix 

• venue and 

• the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers 

rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts fee limits and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

product mix we offer exchangetraded futures and options contracts as well as clearedonly interest rate swap contracts through our acquisition of nex we also offer foreign exchange spot and forward contracts and fixed income products 

rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products 

venue our exchange and platforms are an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

clearing and transaction fees for cash markets business  our cash markets business provides matching services whereby we match a buyer and seller of financial instruments to allow both parties to complete the trade bilaterally or through a thirdparty clearing house we are not involved in the settlement of the contract but charge a transaction fee generally based on volume or notional value of the trade for providing the matching service the cash markets business also includes brokertec americas which generates revenue from a matched principal business this business serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement revenue is generated from this business generally on a transaction fee basis 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services and other various services related to our exchange operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through thirdparty distributors 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotations trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure and incentive programs for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

other revenues other revenue includes access and communication fees access and communication fees are connectivity fees charged to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services our communication services include our colocation program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers 

other revenues include revenues from our optimization services which include fees for risk management and information services for the overthecounter markets including portfolio reconciliation and posttrade processing revenue earned from these services is typically generated through subscriptions or transaction fees 

other revenues also include fees for posttrade services fees for collateral management equity subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms 

expenses 

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume however licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity energy and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce 

the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

in general stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices 

professional fees and outside services this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives regulatory and other compliance matters temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements furniture fixtures and equipment this expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of cbot holdings inc nymex holdings inc and nex as well as other asset and business acquisitions intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm market data and other customer relationships 

other expenses we incur additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

• technology expense consists of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology it also includes costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and some market data customers telecommunications costs of our exchange and fees paid for access to external market data this expense may be driven by system capacity functionality and redundancy requirements it also may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the us to access our electronic platforms directly 

• licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of contract volume in equity index products this expense also includes royalty fees and broker rebates on energy and metals products as well as revenue sharing on cleared swaps contracts and some new product launches this expense fluctuates with changes in contract volumes as well as changes in fee structures 

• other expenses include occupancy and building operations expenses including rent maintenance real estate taxes utilities and other related costs related to leased property in chicago new york the uk india as well as other smaller locations throughout the world other expenses also include marketing and travelrelated expenses as well as general and administrative costs marketing advertising and public relations expense includes media print and other advertising costs as well as costs associated with our product promotion other expenses also include litigation and customer settlements impairment charges on operating assets gains and losses on disposals of certain operating assets and foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on certain foreign monetary assets and liabilities 

nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include noncore investing and financing activities 

• investment income includes income from shortterm investment of clearing firms cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions as well as excess operating cash interest income and realized gains and losses from our marketable securities realized gains and losses as well as dividend income from our strategic equity investments and gains and losses on trading securities in our nonqualified deferred compensation plans investment income is influenced by market interest rates changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms the amount of dividends distributed by our strategic investments and the availability of funds generated by operations 

• interest and other borrowing costs expense includes charges associated with various shortterm and longterm funding facilities including commitment fees on lines of credit agreements 

• equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes income and losses from our investments in spdow jones indices llc spdji shanghai cfetsnex international money broking co ltd and dubai mercantile exchange 

• other income expense includes expenses related to the distribution of a portion of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms gains and losses on derivative contracts as well as other various income and expenses outside our core operations 

critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value 

• level 1 inputs which are considered the most reliable evidence of fair value consist of quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 

• level 2 inputs consist of observable market data such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable 

• level 3 inputs consist of unobservable inputs which are derived and cannot be corroborated by market data or other entityspecific inputs 

for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends in addition the carrying value of goodwill as denominated in foreign currencies is adjusted each reporting period as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar such foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity 

we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the carrying value of the amortizing asset to its undiscounted net cash flows if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value in connection with this impairment assessment management also challenges the useful lives of our definitelived intangible assets on a periodic basis 

revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm a reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges this reserve has historically been immaterial the reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as managements estimate of future adjustment activity 

income taxes calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations and we occasionally may consult with relevant tax authorities or engage third party expertise where appropriate we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use are capitalized we also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained in the cloud software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software which is generally two to four years but up to eight years for certain trading and clearing applications depending upon expected useful lives amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use in addition software assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable or that a reduction in the estimated useful lives is warranted

revenues 



clearing and transaction fees 

futures and options 

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract for futures and options total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain clearedonly contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures below exclude trading volume for the cash markets business as well as interest rate swaps 



we estimate the following decreases in clearing and transaction fees based on a change in total contract volume and a change in average rate per contract during 2020 compared with 2019 



average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure including volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation 

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume contract volume can be influenced by many factors including political and economic factors the regulatory environment and market competition 



in 2020 when compared with 2019 overall market volatility declined following a period of very high volatility in the first quarter of 2020 during the first quarter of 2020 the federal reserve made the unexpected decision to lower the federal funds rate due to economic concerns from the covid19 pandemic which resulted in significant volatility within the financial and equity markets however interest rate volatility subsided following indication by the federal reserve that it did not intend to raise interest rates in the foreseeable future equity market volatility remained high throughout 2020 as a result of the governmental and business response to the covid19 pandemic as well as political uncertainty surrounding the us presidential and congressional elections in november in addition heightened producer price competition within the oil markets combined with lower energy demands during the covid19 pandemic resulted in significant market volatility within the energy market during the first quarter of 2020 however this volatility subsided as oil prices stabilized and demand for crude oil remained low for the remainder of 2020 we believe these factors led to the changes in volume in 2020 when compared with 2019 

interest rate products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years   



in 2020 when compared with 2019 overall interest rate contract volume decreased we believe this was d ue to the federal reserves decision to cut interest rates to near zero in early 2020 and its indication that it would not raise interest rates in the foreseeable future in response to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic 

equity index products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity index products volume below for the year ended 2019 includes microemini contract volumes for each index beginning on may 6 2019 which was the date the contracts were launched 



in 2020 when compared with 2019 equity index contract volume increased due to higher overall volatility in the equity market in 2020 particularly in the first and fourth quarters we believe the increase in volatility was attributable to uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of governmental and business actions to combat the covid19 pandemic as well as political uncertainty surrounding the us presidential and congressional elections average daily contract volume in 2020 also included microemini equity index contract volume of approximately 1 8 million per day compared to approximately 03 million per day in 2019 microemini equity index contracts have a notional size of onetenth of the traditional emini con tracts 

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products 



in 2020 when compared with 2019 overall foreign exchange contract volume was flat which we believe resulted from lower overall volatility in 2020 market volatility subsided in the second half of the year following very high foreign exchange volatility in the first quarter caused by significant uncertainty surrounding the economic impacts of governmental and business 

actions to combat the covid19 pandem ic in addition we believe foreign exchange trading declined slightly due to operational strains from stay at home orders and risk aversion by market participants during the covid19 pandemic 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products 



overall commodity contract volume was relatively flat in 2020 when compared with 2019 corn contract volume decreased due to lower price volatility which we believe was caused by large stock piles and lower demand we believe the increase in soybean contract volume was due to an increase in demand for commodities from china 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products 



overall energy contract volume was relatively flat in 2020 when compared with 2019 which we believe was due to periods of high volatility in early 2020 followed by periods of low volatility as a result of governmental and business actions to combat the covid19 pandem ic  the increase in natural gas volume is the result of significant price declines in early 2020 followed by price increases in the second half of 2020 as a result of higher demand during the winter months this was partially offset by a decrease in crude oil volume due to a reduction in demand caused by the covid19 pandemic 

metal products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products 



overall metal contract volume increased in 2020 when compared with 2019 due to an increase in metals price volatility caused by investors using gold and other precious metals as safehaven alternative investments due to significant uncertainty within other markets caused by the covid19 pandemic 

average rate per contract 

the average rate per contract was substantially the same in 2020 when compared with 2019 there was an increase in the average rate per contract due to a change in product mix interest rate contract volume decreased by 12 percentage points as a percent of total volume while all other products collectively increased by 12 percentage points in general interest rate products have a lower rate per contract compared with the remaining contracts the increase in the average rate per contract was offset by the introduction of the microemini equity index contracts in mid2019 which have a lower average rate per contract compared with a standard emini contract microemini equity index contracts have a notional size of onetenth of the traditional emini contracts 

cash markets business 

total clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2020 includes 4474 million of transaction fees attributable to the cash markets business acquired from nex compared with 4830 million in 2019 this revenue primarily includes brokertecss fixed income volume and ebs foreign exchange volume 



the related average daily notional value for the years ended 2020 and 2019 for key cash markets products were as follows 



overall average daily notional value for the cash markets business decreased in 2020 when compared with 2019 due to expectations of potentially low interest rates for an extended period of time and economic uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one clearing firm represented approximately 10 of our clearing and transaction fees in 2020 should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trad ing activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm 

other sources of revenue 

market data and information services in 2020 when compared with 2019 the increase in market data and information services revenue was largely attributable to an increase in certain device fees an increase in subscriber device counts and higher demand for cme group data 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented in aggregate approximately 35 of our market data and information services revenue in 2020 despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 

other revenues the increase in other revenues in 2020 when compared with 2019 is largely attributable to an increase in custody fees due to a new rate structure put in place in 2020 

expenses 



2020 compared with 2019 

operating expenses decreased by 340 million in 2020 when compared with 2019 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the net decrease in operating expenses 



overall operating expenses decreased in 2020 when compared with 2019 due to the following reasons 

• bonus expenses decreased in 2020 largely due to a reduction in headcount with legacy nex businesses in conjunction with our planned integration as well as performance relative to our 2020 cash earnings target when compared with 2019 performance relative to our 2019 cash earnings target 

• during 2019 we recognized higher impairment charges on certain intangibles and fixed assets due to the disposal of various businesses 

• travel and entertainment expenses decreased as a result of the companys response to the covid19 pandemic with the vast majority of staff working remotely during 2020 

• marketing expenses decreased compared with 2019 due to a reduction in planned advertising media campaigns and special promotional events 

increases in operating expenses in 2020 when compared with 2019 were as follows 

• licensing and other fee agreements expenses increased during 2020 due to higher fees related to revenue sharing agreements for certain equity contracts which resulted from an increase in volume and an increase in license rates for certain products 

• professional fees and outside services expenses increased due to higher legal fees compared to 2019 as well as professional and legal fees incurred in 2020 in connection with to our recently announced joint venture with ihs markit 

• stockbased compensation expense increased due to acceleration of certain grants and the impact related to our september 2019 and 2020 grants 

nonoperating income expense 



investment income the decrease in investment income in 2020 when compared with 2019 was largely due to a decline in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that are reinvested the decrease in earnings resulted primarily from lower rates of interest earned in the cash account at the federal reserve bank of chicago following significant interest rate cuts in early 2020 despite an increase in our average reinvestment amount 

interest and other borrowing costs interest and other borrowing costs were lower in 2020 when compared with 2019 primarily due to lower borrowing costs on commercial paper issuances as there were higher average balances of commercial paper outstanding during 2019 when compared with 2020 interest and other borrowing costs were also lower during 2020 due to interest expense recognized on the €3500 million fixed rate notes and the ¥191 billion term loan assumed as part of the nex acquisition in 2018 and subsequently paid off during the first quarter of 2019 

equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries higher income generated from our spdji business venture contributed to an increase in equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2020 when compared with 2019 

other income expense in 2020 when compared with 2019 we recognized lower expense related to a reduction in the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestments to the clearing firms due to lower interest income earned on our reinvestment in addition a gain of 15 million was recognized on derivative contracts in 2020 compared with a net loss of 177 million in 2019 

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 



in 2020 when compared with 2019 the effective tax rate was higher due to the recognition of additional benefits from the internal revenue code section 250 deduction in 2019 proposed fdii deduction regulations were released in 2019 and as a result we revised our income tax calculations to reflect the proposed guidance the benefit recognized in 2019 includes estimates for the deduction for 2018 and 2019 whereas the benefit recognized in 2020 only includes the deduction for 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

we have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations however as part of the funding for the nex acquisition we utilized our commercial paper program in late 2018 and through the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 for shortterm funding requirements while our cost structure is generally fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels in addition to using our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations we may continue to utilize our commercial paper program to meet our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments it is also possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity performance improvements integration of acquired platforms as well as improvements to some of our office spaces each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and modification of our offices remote data centers telecommunications network and other operating equipment in 2021 we expect capital expenditures to total approximately 1800 million to 1900 million net of any leasehold improvement allowances and any onetime costs associated with the nex integration we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders with a target of between 50 to 60 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant we are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of our state of incorporation which could also limit our ability to declare and pay dividends on february 3 2021 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 090 per share the dividend will be payable on march 25 2021 to shareholders of record on march 10 2021 assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately 3220 million the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 250 per share on december 10 2020 paid on january 13 2021 to the shareholders of record on december 28 2020 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results capital expenditures potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

sources and uses of cash 

the following is a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was relatively flat in 2020 compared with 2019 

investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2020 compared with 2019 was largely due to a decrease in cash proceeds received on sales of certain privatelyheld investments 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was higher in 2020 when compared with 2019 due to an increase in the amount of cash dividends paid the increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a reduction in the amount of outstanding debt repayments in 2020 compared with 2019 

debt instruments 

the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2020

liquidity and cash management 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 16 billion at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our corporate investment policy and alternative investment choices a majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in us treasury securities us government agency securities and us treasury security reverse repurchase agreements and shortterm bank deposits our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that an additional contribution may be necessary in 2021 to meet our funding goal however the amount of the

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2020 consisted of fixedrate borrowings of 34 billion in us dollar equivalent changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixedrate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows we did not have any variablerate borrowings at december 31 2020 

credit risk 

cme clearing house 

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through thirdparty exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for exchangetraded and interest rate swaps products for clearing firms we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk we establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity we marktomarket open positions of clearing firms at least once a day twice a day for futures and options contracts and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value we have the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant these practices allow our clearing house to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity 

despite our safeguards we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

we maintain two separate financial safeguard packages 

• a financial safeguard package for all futures options and overthecounter swap contracts other than cleared interest rate swap contracts base package and 

• a financial safeguard package for cleared interest rate swap contracts 

in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for clearing membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit 

we maintain a 70 billion 364day multicurrency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or us treasury securities performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day multicurrency line of credit we also have the option to use our 24 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default 

at december 31 2020 aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for both financial safeguard packages was 2119 billion including cash performance bond deposits noncash deposits interest earnings facility funds and letters of credit a defaulting firms performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm 

the following shows the available assets at december 31 2020 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets 



 

1 our clearing house designates 1000 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firms guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit 

2 guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms include guaranty fund contributions required of clearing firms but do not include any excess deposits held by us at the direction of clearing firms 

3 in the event of a clearing firm default if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm our corporate contribution and the nondefaulting clearing firms guaranty fund contributions we would assess all nondefaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the guaranty fund we could assess nondefaulting clearing members 275 of their existing guaranty fund requirements up to a maximum of 550 of their existing guaranty fund requirements as provided in the rules assessment powers are calculated to reflect the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for in the event clearing member defaults exhaust the guaranty fund however the total amount available would be reduced by the defaulted clearing members assessment obligations since they would no longer be able to satisfy their obligations 

the following shows the available assets for the interest rate swap financial safeguard package at december 31 2020 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears interest rate swap contracts after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets 



 

1 our clearing house designates 1500 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firms guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit 

2 guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms for interest rate swap contracts include guaranty fund contributions required of those clearing firms 

3 in the event of a clearing firm default if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm our corporate contribution and the nondefaulting firms guaranty fund contributions we would assess nondefaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the interest rate swap guaranty fund assessment powers are calculated to reflected the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for based on potential failure of the third and fourth largest clearing 

brokertec americas matched principal business 

brokertec americas maintains a matched principal business where it serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement brokertec americas uses fixed income clearing corporation ficc a thirdparty central clearing house as well as a thirdparty clearing bank for the settlement of transactions and is required to post shortterm margin requirements twice a day that can vary based on the size of unsettled transactions and any adverse market changes at december 31 2020 the balance of the collateral at ficc was 1001 million which was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 

without sufficient funds to meet its obligations brokertec americas could be exposed to risk of breach of contract with the counterparties and the inability to continue as a member of the thirdparty central clearing house transactions with clearing house members are typically confirmed and novated shortly after execution at which point the clearing house assumes the risk of settlement for transactions with counterparties that are not members of the thirdparty clearing house settlement typically occurs on the day following execution and prior to settlement brokertec americas is exposed to the risk of loss in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations if that were to occur brokertec americas would have the right to cover or liquidate the open position but could incur a loss as a result of market movements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on monetary assets liabilities revenues and expenses held at subsidiaries where those balances and activity are denominated in a currency other than the subsidiarys functional currency gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result primarily from cash debt and other monetary assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in british pounds euros and japanese yen 

aggregate transaction losses for 2020 2019 and 2018 were 93 million 72 million and 736 million respectively we expect the foreign currency gainloss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold monetary assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries brexit continues to generate economic and political uncertainty throughout the world particularly throughout the uk and the eu this uncertainty could potentially lead to significant volatility with foreign currency exchange rates which could result in additional foreign currency gainloss 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets liabilities revenues and expenses from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we report on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income the financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income aggregate translation gains losses net of tax for 2020 2019 and 2018 were 1343 million 06 million and 25 million respectively 

foreign currency exchange risk related to customer collateral 

a portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in various foreign currencies we marktomarket all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price therefore our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results

we continue to expand and deepen our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world with the most broad diversified portfolio of benchmark products we believe we have significant opportunity to expand the participation of our nonus customer base in our markets our penetration of these markets lags our development in the united states and we believe that there is room for significant growth and development of these financial markets in 2019 approximately 28 of our electronic futures and options volume was from transactions reported as outside the united states and approximately 58 of our market data revenue was derived from outside the united states we also achieved 20 growth in trading volume during asian trading hours and 7 growth during european trading hours in 2019 compared to the 2018

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify and become more global especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank european market infrastructure regulation emir emir 22 markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii capital requirements directive iv crd iv market abuse regulation benchmarks regulation basel iii and various other laws and regulations 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 14 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties 

competition in our derivatives exchange business 

we believe competition in the derivatives business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse and complementary product offerings frequency and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from others in the industry we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop and offer new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability functionality and security maintain liquidity and low transaction costs continue to strengthen our risk management capabilities and solutions and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers 

we compete in a large and expanding financial services trading clearing and settlement marketplace globally our competitors include among other entities exchanges such as intercontinental exchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited and deutsche börse ag competition also includes alternative means of developing exposures through alternative instruments depending on market factors such as cash otc etfs options warrants contracts for differences structured products and other offerings and incorporates large customer internalization of trade flows new emerging competitors have targeted different segments of our industry and emerging technologies may offer alternative products in the future competition in our industry continues to be dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business 

competition in our cme clearing business 

in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with compliance with doddfrank emir 22 basel iii mifid ii and other various laws and regulations 

our competitors in the clearing services space include among others companies such as ice lch group the options clearing corporation depository trust  clearing corporation and deutsche börse ag in light of the implementation of regulatory requirements and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing and other related posttrade services 

we believe competition in clearing services is based on among other things the value of providing customers with capital and margin efficiencies quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house regulatory costs timely delivery of the services reputation diversity of the service offerings confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the fees charged for the services provided 

competition in our cash markets business 

the cash markets businesses face substantial competition across a wide array of venues in the fx space the marketplace is highly fragmented and there is competition from other electronic communication networks single dealer platforms bankowned multiparticipant platforms streaming and request for quote services trading venues tied to data platforms voice brokers other broker enabled platforms and other venues there is a growing array of platforms and technologies and they are often owned by many wellcapitalized financial institutions and intermediaries that are also driving internalization of client fx trade flows in the fixed income space there are also multiple providers of treasury european and us repo and european bond trading and a multitude of competitors and new entrants offering singledealer liquidity bankowned multiparticipant platforms streaming and request for quote services and other broker and exchangeenabled platforms 

competition in our optimization services business 

the optimization services business faces substantial competition across each of the segments in which cme group operates there are multiple providers of compression services reconciliation services trade processing analytics and regulatory reporting services in addition there is considerable innovation occurring in this business with new entrants and new technologies being developed to serve customers and differentiate offerings 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products although we may receive license fees for such products such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable product 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are regulated and serve a customerbase that includes regulated institutions or individuals developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly affect our businesses as such we are subject to extensive regulation primarily in the united states and europe 

in june 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which the electorate voted in favor of withdrawal from the european union brexit which continues to create a number of uncertainties for the financial services sector the united kingdoms withdrawal agreement bill was signed into law on january 24 2020 and the united kingdom formally left the european union on january 31 2020 under the terms of the withdrawal agreement there will be an 11month transition period due to expire on december 31 2020 as a result of brexit we have established certain businesses in amsterdam a european union jurisdiction which will allow us to continue to provide services to european union clients also on january 1 2020 amendments to the european market infrastructure regulation emir 22 became effective and made changes to the european union equivalence and recognition regime for noneuropean union clearing houses including cme clearing as further discussed below

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of global market economic and political conditions that are beyond our control and that could significantly impact our business and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets the trading volumes in our markets are directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility however as evidenced by our past performance in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital the shifts in market trading patterns we experienced as a result of the financial crisis of 2008 may or may not recur in the future and our business will be affected by future economic uncertainties which may result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us a reduction in overall trading volume or in certain products could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenue material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business and our failure to maintain compliance with regulations our status as a regulated entity or brokertec americas status as a member in good standing at ficc could result in the loss of customers 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states united kingdom and europe as a result of our global operations we are also subject to the rules and regulations of the local jurisdictions in which we conduct business and offer our products and services as appropriate 

due to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 the united states and numerous other governments have undertaken reviews of the legal framework governing financial markets and have either enacted new laws rules and regulations or are in the process of enacting new laws rules and regulations that will impact our business we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the extensive regulations that apply to our business additionally regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally such as enhanced capital requirements may adversely impact their trading activity in our markets also on january 1 2020 amendments to the european market infrastructure regulation emir 22 became effective the implementation of the regulations under this legislation may increase our regulatory costs including substantial new authority to impose fines andor create a disincentive for certain clients to use our products the european union equivalence and recognition regime also has the potential to impact the cost and ease or difficulty for certain of our otc execution platforms to provide access to customers on a global basis there is also the risk that new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could be imposed in other jurisdictions this could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume and demand for our market data and other services 

our brokerdealer and multilateral trading facility businesses brokertec and ebs are extensively regulated these regulatory obligations generally include proper licensing and qualification of the firms and individuals substantive conduct standards communication and disclosure rules monitoring and surveillance training capital requirements supervisory obligations maintenance of antimoney laundering programs suspicious activity reporting risk management standards trade reporting and ongoing examinations and reviews the risks from failing to meet these compliance and regulatory obligations include potential liability disciplinary action against the firm and individuals monetary penalties and restrictions on future activities 

brokertec americas matched principal platform facilitates anonymous trading in significant volumes from wholesale market participants many of which are ficc members and understand that brokertec americas is also a ficc member such that their trades are expected to be novated promptly to ficc which will be their ultimate counterparty a failure of brokertec americas to maintain its membership could adversely impact the willingness of such participants to continue trading on our platform as part of maintaining its membership brokertec americas is required to timely and fully meet all margin calls and other obligations established by ficc and as such must maintain ready access to sufficient liquidity to satisfy those obligations brokertec americas maintains access to liquidity resources it believes will satisfy these obligations in normal and stressed circumstances but there can be no guarantee it will never experience a shortfall 

to the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market derivatives clearing organization swap execution facility or brokerdealer or other regulatory penalties 

legislation may be proposed both domestically and internationally that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets if such proposals were to become law they could have a negative impact on our industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading and could make our markets less competitive 

legislative or regulatory changes could be adopted that would change the structure of our business its current governance structure or impose significant costs on us by for example requiring more of our funds to be set aside for the guaranty fund further other jurisdictions could assert significant changes to our governance business practices and costs in order to continue to make our services available in those jurisdictions 

please see item 1  business  regulatory matters beginning on page 10 for additional information on our areas of regulatory focus 

some of cme clearings largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

our clearing house seeks to offer customers intermediaries and clearing firms universal access in order to maximize the efficient use of capital exercise appropriate oversight of value at risk and maintain operating leverage from clearing activities on our exchanges our strategic business plan is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options business some of our clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market 

participants to transfer positions of futures or options from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our revenues and profits could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition from other companies if we are not able to successfully compete our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and in some cases operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges otc markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large industry participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others our competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do 

our competitors may 

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected a decline in our fees or loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

please see item 1  business  competition beginning on page 9 for additional information on the competitive environment and its potential impact on our business 

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers at substantially similar trading levels or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume in our markets to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution facilities our preand posttrade services and clearing facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies in the past such as lowering the fees they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity payments or rebates we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to expand our products and services that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin 

our clearing firm clients must meet certain capital requirements and must deposit collateral to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements there is no guarantee the collateral deposited will continue to maintain its value to the extent a clearing firm were to experience a decrease in capital and be unable to meet requirements it may be required to decrease its trading activity 

additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts and a substantial decrease in their trading activity could have a negative impact on the liquidity of the particular product line or contract 

if we fail to maintain our trading volume as a result of a loss of customers or decrease in trading activity expand our product offerings or execution facilities or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected declines in trading volume may also negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of trading volume because our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis and our profitability could be adversely affected 

our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyber security threats which could result in wrongful use of our information or our customers’ information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in substantial liabilities we also could be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems andor investigate any alleged attack 

we regard the secure storage and transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to targeted attacks unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism ransom attacks firewall or encryption failures or other security problems criminal groups political activist groups and nationstate actors have targeted the financial services industry and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other information security threats while we have not experienced cyber incidents that are individually or in the aggregate material we have experienced cyber attacks of varying degrees in the past we have designed our cyber defense program to mitigate such attacks by preventative detective and responsive measures our usage of mobile and cloud technologies may increase our risk for a cyber attack our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our technology systems and data or our customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the services we provide that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while resulting in regulatory penalties or the imposition of additional obligations by regulators as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous and complex any failure to comply may carry significant penalties and reputational damage 

as part of our global information security and privacy programs we employ resources to monitor and protect our technology infrastructure and employees against such cyber attacks including the rapid response to zeroday vulnerabilities and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property assets however our security measures or those of our thirdparty providers including any cloudbased technologies may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed any security attack or breach could result in system failures and delays malfunctions in our operations loss of customers or lower trading volume loss of competitive position damage to our reputation disruption of our business legal liability or regulatory fines and significant costs which in turn may cause our revenues and earnings to decline though we have insurance against some cyber and privacy risks and attacks we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and regulatory liability and penalties 

many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction or that we failed to effectively fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities we may be subject to disputes regarding the quality of trade execution the settlement of trades or other matters relating to our services we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation to the extent we are found to have failed to fulfill our regulatory obligations we could lose our authorizations or licenses or become subject to conditions that could make future operations more costly and impair our profitability such events could also result in customer dissatisfaction and a decline in their willingness to trade on our markets 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism which poses physical security risks and cybersecurity risks than other companies 

given our role in the global financial services industry we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on our industry generally or on our business while we have implemented significant physical security protection measures business continuity plans and established backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such attack may result in harm to our personnel 

the closure of our facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to our business 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

maintaining our reputation and brand is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and to maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services including social and environmental concerns relating to certain commodity products and increased impact from climate change could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our business prospects these issues may include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a including risks from customer disputes system failures or intrusions failures to meet our regulatory obligations failures of a clearing firm or other counterparty issues relating to our thirdparty suppliers alleged or actual fraud or misconduct or manipulative activity or ineffective risk management 

the success of our markets depends on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance capacity security and speed required by our customers 

the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces for a wide range of products that have the required functionality performance capacity security and speed to attract and retain customers in 2019 90 of our overall contract volume was generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform and we generated 3833 million in revenue attributable to the brokertec and ebs trading platforms we plan to migrate the brokertec and ebs platforms to cme globex in 2020 and 2021 respectively 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platforms and other technology offerings to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading systems and technology offerings if we are unable to develop them to include other products and markets or if they do not have the required functionality performance capacity security and speed desired by our customers our ability to successfully compete and our revenues and profits will be adversely affected while we are focused on the migration of the brokertec and ebs platforms to cme globex from both a technology and a customer experience perspective we cannot guarantee that we will not experience any client attrition and to the extent any such client attrition is significant it could have an impact on our revenues 

additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

our business is highly dependent on our ability to process execute and monitor in an efficient and uninterrupted manner a large number of transactions which occur at high volumes and frequencies across multiple systems and our ability to access key business data financial information order processing and invoicing we are heavily reliant on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology and communications and other business systems and software supporting our operations our systems or those of our thirdparty providers including cloud providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 



 we cannot assure that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error on our part or on the part of our vendors natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyber attacks acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems or the systems of our thirdparty providers do not operate properly are compromised or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platforms and technology offerings or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impact our trading volumes impair our reputation damage our brand result in regulatory fines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

regulations relating to our trading and clearing systems generally require the handling of anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause them to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in volume however we cannot assure that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of our platforms system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead our regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and as we execute our business strategy although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected 

we as well as many of our customers depend on thirdparty suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors cloud hosting providers data center providers and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our trading platforms and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services or provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to 

adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased trading volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our business exposes us to substantial credit risk of our clearing firms and other counterparties and consequently a decrease in their financial resources could adversely affect us 

our clearing house operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles we routinely guarantee transactions submitted by our clearing firm customers with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one or more of our clearing firms additionally we are exposed to the risk of loss from the failure of a matched principal counterparty to settle its trades at brokertec americas 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations additionally brokertec americas is exposed to the potential risk of loss in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms and other counterparties can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a fund currently 980 million to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to qualified family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances if their derivatives clearing firm member becomes insolvent 

our threemonth eurodollar futures contracts are based on the threemonth us dollar london interbank offered rate libor underlying rate to the extent trading in eurodollar contracts decreases or is discontinued and our alternative contracts are not successful our revenues would be negatively impacted certain of our other businesses could also be negatively affected by changes to libor 

our eurodollar futures contract is based on the threemonth us dollar ice libor underlying rate in 2019 average trading volume in our eurodollar contracts was 44 million contracts and open interest was 554 million contracts libor is the subject of national and international proposals for reform which advocate for the transition of survey based interbank offered rates to alternative transactionbased reference rates a transition from the widespread use of libor to alternative benchmark rates is likely to occur over the next several years in july 2017 the uk fca which regulates libor announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions has recommended replacing us dollar libor with other benchmark alternatives such as sofr it is unknown whether these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for libor any transition away from libor to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we have closely engaged with the industry regulators and market participants to launch products using alternative reference rates including our sofr and sterling overnight index average sonia futures contracts in november 2019 we shared via a public webinar details of improved fallback plans to convert eurodollar futures and options into 3month sofr futures and options however there is no guarantee that a transition to such contracts would be successful and would replace the revenue we derive from our eurodollar contracts if the trading volume were to decline or discontinue altogether 

our market data revenues may be reduced by decreased demand poor overall economic conditions regulatory changes or a significant change in how market participants trade and use market data 

we sell our market data to individuals trading institutions and other organizations that use our information services to participate in our markets andor monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data and information services represented 11 and 10 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively a decrease in overall trading volume may lead to a decreased demand for our market data the level of trading activity by our customers may be affected by their profitability and capital constraints and may lead to a decreased demand for our market data for example in recent years we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data connections due to continued economic uncertainty high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms and the continued impact of legacy incentive programs tied to trading terminals we could also become subject to regulatory actions which could have the potential to restrict how we charge for our market data we also license our market data to be used in the creation of derivative financial products and changes to regulation including the impact of any changes in laws or government policy may impact the demand of our market data for such derivative works 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the otc markets and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued 

growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances our growth strategy also may subject us to increased legal compliance and regulatory obligations unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions other investments and strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of historical merger and acquisition activity in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us which could impact our ability to identify growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially 

the process of integration also may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from our growth initiatives and investments which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we also may be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively affect our stock price our acquisition of nex is subject to many of these risks including the potential we may not achieve the expected cost savings synergies and other strategic benefits from the transaction within the anticipated time frames and the integration of nex with our operations may not be successful or may be delayed or more costly than expected or that we may experience customer attrition 

the expansion of our global operations is complex and subjects us to increased business and economic risks that could adversely affect our financial results 

in connection with our expanded global operations we face certain risks inherent in doing business internationally these risks include 

 if we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully or if the risks above become substantial for us our financial performance and operating results could suffer further any measures we may implement to reduce risks of our international operations may not be effective may increase our expenses and may require significant management time and effort 

as our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate our foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements from local currencies into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore any increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

the ultimate impact of brexit is contingent upon the final terms of withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the uk and the european union following a transition period which is scheduled to end in december 2020 brexit may result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the withdrawal process progresses as a result of brexit we have established certain of our businesses in amsterdam a european union jurisdiction which have resulted in and may continue to result in increased legal compliance and operational costs 

our compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators including during regulatory examinations and we are subject to their inquiry and oversight our regulators have broad enforcement and supervisory powers including the power to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our regulatory designations or the registration of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of effective compliance and monitoring programs in the case of alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

we maintain compliance policies procedures and programs which are designed to deter detect prevent monitor and manage our risks but such policies procedures and programs may not be fully effective some of our risk management processes depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers employees or other matters or potential threats that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal and compliance regulatory reputational and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct or manipulative activity by employees of financial services firms and other market participants in the past improper trading activity on our platforms by participants could include activities such as spoofing layering wash trading and manipulation misconduct by our employees and agents could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases if we were found to have not met our regulatory oversight and compliance obligations we could be subject to regulatory sanctions financial penalties restrictions on our activities for failure to properly identify monitor and respond to potentially problematic activity and seriously harm our reputation our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability further allegations by regulatory or criminal authorities of improper trading activities could affect our brand and reputation and reduce the number of participants trading in our markets if that should occur we could face a corresponding decline in trading volume and revenue 

intellectual property rights licensed from thirdparty price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue material changes in the intellectual property landscape or regulatory framework pertaining to such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products 

we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from thirdparty price reporting agencies to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily susceptible to manipulation our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenues 

a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others could adversely affect our business 

our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have patent applications pending our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our proprietary 

technology and intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy misappropriate or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example one of our former employees pleaded guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry as a result we may face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patents we could also be required to pay damages if we were found to infringe patents held by others which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we might still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 37 billion of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 2l billion  

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our us exchanges swap execution facility and clearing house also are required to maintain minimum capital levels as defined by the cftc and brokertec americas is required to meet minimum capital requirements set by the sec under emir 22 our clearing house could be subject to enhanced minimum capital standards as well 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the past we have experienced ratings downgrades our failure to maintain our ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital additionally if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of our fixedrate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

our average rate per contract for our derivatives business is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract for our derivatives business which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation we cannot assure that our average rate per contract in any particular period serves as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

eleven of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our derivatives exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our exchange members combined with the cme members rights to elect six directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

eleven of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our exchange members in 2019 85 of our derivatives contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result members may not have the same economic interests as holders of our class a common stock in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their methods of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges and require that we maintain open outcry for options products still meeting certain volume thresholds and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our exchange members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent we have limited ability to eliminate these election rights in 2018 we held a special meeting of shareholders to eliminate all or some of these director election rights while the proposal received majority support it failed to achieve the required support under delaware law from a majority of the outstanding owners of the class b common stock in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

references in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to cme group inc cme group and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively references to “exchange” are to chicago mercantile exchange inc cme the board of trade of the city of chicago inc cbot new york mercantile exchange inc nymex and commodity exchange inc comex collectively unless otherwise noted

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options contracts we also clear futures options and swaps contracts through our clearing house futures contracts options contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global company with customer access available virtually all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers governments and central banks customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers

we also provide optimization services that deliver transaction lifecycle management and information services to help our customers optimize their capital mitigate their risk and reduce operational costs optimization services includes traiana trioptima and reset 

our clearing house clears settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges in addition to cleared swaps products our clearing houses performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the 

position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies certain brokertec and ebs contracts are cleared at thirdparty clearing houses 

business trends 

economic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the united states and european credit crises fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the federal reserve bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry competition is influenced by our brand and reputation the efficiency and security of our settlement clearing and support services depth and liquidity of our markets diversity of product offerings including frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services our ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs efficient and seamless customer experience transparency reliability anonymity and security of transaction processing the regulatory environment connectivity accessibility flexibility in execution methods and distribution technology capability and innovation as well as overall transaction costs we believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges clearing organizations swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as markets continue to evolve we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers the competitive environment to which we are subject is discussed in item 1 business on page 9 

regulatory environment exchangetraded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly impact our business compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability the regulatory environment to which we are subject is discussed in item 1 business on page 10 

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on maximizing futures and options growth globally diversifying our business and revenues and delivering unparalleled customer efficiencies and operational excellence this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes our strategic initiatives are discussed in item 1 business on page 7 

revenues 

clearing and transaction fees a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for exchangetraded and overthecounter contracts because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue 

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations 

we may periodically change fees volume discounts fee limits and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

product mix we offer exchangetraded futures and options contracts as well as clearedonly interest rate swap contracts through our acquisition of nex we also offer foreign exchange spot and forward contracts and fixed income products rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products 

venue our exchange and platforms are an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our cme electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

clearing and transaction fees for cash markets business  our cash markets business provides matching services whereby we match a buyer and seller of financial instruments to allow both parties to complete the trade bilaterally or through a thirdparty clearing house we are not involved in the settlement of the contract but charge a transaction fee generally based on volume or notional value of the trade for providing the matching service the cash markets business also includes brokertec americas which generates revenue from a matched principal business this business serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement revenue is generated from this business generally on a transaction fee basis 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services and other various services related to our exchange operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third party distributors 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotations trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure and incentive programs for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

other revenues other revenue includes access and communication fees access and communication fees are connectivity fees charged to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services our communication services include our colocation program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers 

other revenues include revenues from our optimization services which include fees for risk management and information services for the overthecounter markets including portfolio reconciliation and posttrade processing revenue earned from these services is typically generated through subscriptions or transaction fees 

other revenues also include fees for posttrade services fees for collateral management equity subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms 

expenses 

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume however licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity energy and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

in general stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices 

professional fees and outside services this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives regulatory and other compliance matters temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements furniture fixtures and equipment this expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of cbot holdings inc nymex holdings inc and nex as well as other asset and business acquisitions intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm market data and other customer relationships 

other expenses we incur additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 

nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include noncore investing and financing activities 

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value 

 for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for 

impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives 

revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearinrg firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests 

income taxes calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations and we occasionally may consult with relevant tax authorities or engage third party expertise where appropriate we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized we also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained in the cloud software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally two to four years amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use

results of operations 

financial highlights 

the following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended december 31 2018 and december 2017 see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 filed with the sec on february 28 2019 



revenues 



clearing and transaction fees 

futures and options 

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract for futures and options total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain clearedonly contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures below exclude trading volume for the cash markets business as well as interest rate swaps 



we estimate the following decreases in clearing and transaction fees based on a change in total contract volume and a change in average rate per contract during 2019 compared with 2018  



average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure including volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation 

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume contract volume can be influenced by many factors including political and economic factors the regulatory environment and market competition 



during 2019 volatility spiked in mid2019 following a shift in expectations surrounding the federal reserves interest rate policies in mid2019 the federal reserve began cutting interest rates following earlier indications that it intended to continue to slowly increase interest rates throughout 2019 uncertainty surrounding the united states foreign trade policy also increased mid2019 following the threat of additional tariffs by the fourth quarter market volatility generally declined as uncertainty surrounding the federal reserves interest rate policy subsided uncertainty surrounding the foreign trade policy also diminished following a preliminary trade agreement between the united states and china at the end of 2019 we believe the net result of these factors lead to overall volume remaining relatively flat in 2019 when compared with 2018 

interest rate products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years   

in 2019 compared with 2018 overall interest rate contract volume increased slightly particularly for short term contracts due to volatility caused by continued uncertainty surrounding the federal reserves interest rate policy we believe volatility increased in the middle of 2019 due to a shift in market expectations at that time following the federal reserves decision to initiate interest rate cuts as well as uncertainty surrounding the united states future economic growth 

equity index products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity index products volume below for the year ended 2019 includes microemini contract volumes for each index beginning on may 6 2019 which was the date the contracts were launched 



in 2019 compared with 2018 equity index contract volume decreased slightly due to lower overall volatility in the equity market in 2019 particularly in the fourth quarter volatility levels were higher in 2018 due to uncertainty surrounding the united states foreign trade and other economic policies however the volatility leveled off at the end of 2019 the overall decrease in volume was partially offset by additional volume generated from the launch of microemini equity index contracts in the second quarter of 2019 which have a notional size of onetenth of the traditional emini contracts average daily contract volume in 2019 included approximately 317000 in microemini equity index contracts 

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products 



in 2019 compared with 2018 overall foreign exchange contract volume decreased which we believe resulted from lower overall volatility following periods of higher volatility in early 2018 we believe foreign exchange volatility decreased in 2019 following the indication by the federal reserve and other central banks to limit the number of interest rate changes in 2019 we also believe that the lack of a final resolution of a trade agreement between the united states and china and the delay in the united kingdom european union membership referendum contributed to lower volume 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products 



overall commodity contract volume decreased slightly in 2019 when compared with 2018 we believe the decline in soybean contract volume was due to lower us exports of soybeans to china due to uncertainty surrounding trade policies between the countries the decrease in wheat contract volume was due to lower volatility levels resulting from a surplus of global supplies in major growing regions around the world corn contract volume increased due to significant uncertainty surrounding crop yields for the 2019 growing season due to higher than normal precipitation levels 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products 



overall energy contract volume decreased in 2019 when compared with 2018 which we believe was due to lower price volatility within the energy markets throughout 2019 caused by greater price stability within the crude oil markets in addition expanded production of natural gas resulted in a reduction of price volatility in early 2019 which we believe contributed to a decrease in natural gas volume 

metal products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products 



overall metal contract volume increased in 2019 when compared with 2018 due to an increase in metals price volatility caused by investors using gold and other precious metals as safehaven alternative investments to other volatile markets particularly in mid2019 

average rate per contract 

the average rate per contract decreased in 2019 when compared with 2018 which is largely due to a shift in product mix interest rate contract volume increased by 2 percentage points as a percent of total volume while all other products collectively decreased by 2 percentage points in general interest rate products have a lower rate per contract compared with the remaining contracts the decrease in average rate per contract was also due to the introduction of the microemini equity index contracts which have a lower average rate per contract compared with a standard emini contract microemini equity index contracts have a notional size of onetenth of the traditional emini contracts 

cash markets business 

total clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2019 includes 4830 million of transaction fees attributable to the cash markets business acquired from nex compared with 912 million for the period november 3 2018 through december 31 2018 this revenue primarily includes brokertec americas fixed income volume and ebs foreign exchange volume 



the related average daily notional value for the year ended 2019 and the period november 3 2018 through december 31 2018 were as follows 



concentration of revenue 

we bill a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers no individual clearing firm represented at least 10 of our clearing and transaction fees in 2019 should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm 

other sources of revenue 

market data and information services in 2019 when compared with 2018 the increase in market data and information services revenue was attributable to the additional market data revenue generated by market data subscribers and distributors associated with the cash markets business subsequent to the nex acquisition in november 2018 in addition fees for legacy cme basic realtime market data services increased to 105 per month from 85 per month for each device beginning in the second quarter of 2018 which also contributed to the increase in revenue in 2019 compared with 2018 the increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue due to modest declines in screen counts due to costcutting initiatives at member firms 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented in aggregate 37 of our market data and information services revenue in 2019  despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 

other revenues the increase in other revenues in 2019 when compared with 2018 is largely attributable to the additional other revenue contributed by the nex acquisition other revenues from nex primarily include optimization services such as portfolio management analytics and trade and regulatory reporting 

expenses 



2019 compared with 2018 

operating expenses increased by 5784 million in 2019 when compared with 2018 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the net increase in operating expenses 



overall operating expenses increased in 2019 compared with 2018 due to the following reasons 

 decreases in operating expenses in 2019 when compared with 2018 were as follows 



nonoperating income expense 



  

investment income the decrease in investment income in 2019 when compared with 2018 was largely due to a decline in net realized and unrealized gains losses the decrease in investment income was also due to a decline in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that are reinvested which primarily resulted from lower average reinvestment balances as well as an overall decrease in the rate of return earned on our investments 

interest and other borrowing costs interest and other borrowing costs were higher in 2019 compared with 2018 due to a full year of interest expense incurred on 5000 million of 375 fixed rate notes due june 2028 and 7000 million of 415 fixed rate notes due june 2048 issued in the second quarter of 2018 

equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries higher income generated from our spdji business venture and net earnings from investments acquired through the transaction with nex contributed to increases in equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2019 when compared with the prior year 

other income expense in 2019 when compared with 2018 we recognized lower net losses on various derivative contracts in 2018 we recognized net losses on our foreign exchange option and forward contracts used to mitigate certain exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation on the currency required to facilitate the nex acquisition as well as derivative contracts that we assumed in our acquisition of nex expense related to the redistribution of income earned on performance bond and guaranty fund contributions was relatively flat in 2019 compared to 2018 

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 



in 2019 when compared with 2018 the effective tax rate was lower due to the recognition of benefits from the internal revenue code section 250 deduction in 2019 proposed fdii deduction regulations were released in 2019 and as a result we have revised our income tax calculations to reflect the proposed guidance the benefit recognized in 2019 includes estimates for the deduction for 2018 and 2019 

in addition we recognized higher deferred tax expense in 2018 due to the acquisition of nex 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

we have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations however as part of the funding for the nex acquisition we utilized our commercial paper program in late 2018 and throughout 2019 for shortterm funding requirements while our cost structure is fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels in addition to using our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations we may continue to utilize our commercial paper program to meet our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments it is also possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2019  these were as follows 

  



arrangements as well as liabilities that have uncertainty associated with timing of payments including liabilities for benefit plans it also excludes liabilities that will not be settled in cash 

leases include rent payments for office space in chicago new york and other smaller offices in the united states and in various foreign countries the lease for our headquarters in chicago expires in 2032 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 140 million to 197 million  we also maintain leases for datacenter space in the chicago area which expires in march 2031 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from  169 million to  183 million  the lease for our office space in new york expires in december 2028 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from  143 million to  153 million  

purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements for advertising licensing hardware software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services debt obligations include repayment of principal and interest associated with the debt obligations 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity performance improvements integration of acquired platforms as well as improvements to some of our office spaces each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data centers telecommunications network and other operating equipment in 2020  we expect capital expenditures to total approximately 180 million to 200 million net of any leasehold improvement allowances and any onetime costs associated with the nex integration we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders with a target of between 50 to 60 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant cme group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends on february 5 2020 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 085 per share the dividend will be payable on march 25 2020 to shareholders of record on march 10 2020  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately 300 million the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 250 per share on december 11 2019 paid on january 15 2020 to the shareholders of record on december 27 2019 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results capitalization expenditures potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

sources and uses of cash 

the following is a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 

  

nm not meaningful 

operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared with 2018 is largely due to the incremental operating cash generated from the business lines acquired through our acquisition of nex in november 2018 

investing activities 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2019 when compared with 2018 was largely due to the cash consideration required for the acquisition of nex in november 2018 net of cash received 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was higher in 2019 when compared with in 2018 due to a net reduction in outstanding debt in 2019 compared with issuance of debt in 2018 the increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in cash dividends 

debt instruments 

the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2019  

  

  

 we maintain a 24 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions which matures in november 2022 the proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at cme groups discretion and if necessary for maturities of commercial paper as long as we are not in default under this facility we have the option to increase it up to 30 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds this facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty under this facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test which is defined as our consolidated shareholders equity at september 30 2017 giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements and in no event greater than 20 billion in aggregate multiplied by 065 we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility but the outstanding commercial paper balance is backstopped against this facility 

we maintain a 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing the facility provides for borrowings of up to 70 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian for our collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or us treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility at december 31 2019  guaranty funds available to collateralize the facility totaled 85 billion  we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion our 364day facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as cme consolidated shareholders equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 8000 million we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility on may 1 2019 we amended and extended the agreement which will expire on april 29 2020 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 24 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility and our 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility for 70 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

at december 31 2019  we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 21 billion under our multicurrency revolving senior credit facility 

at december 31 2019  we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined by securities and exchange commission rules and regulations 

liquidity and cash management 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 16 billion at december 31 2019 and 14 billion at december 31 2018  the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices a majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in us treasury securities us government agency securities and us treasury security reverse repurchase agreements our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that no contribution will be necessary in 2020 as we exceeded our funding goal by 327 million in 2019 however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on various factors including the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2020 and the december 31 2020 discount rate

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2019 consisted of fixedrate borrowings of 37 billion in us dollar equivalent changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixedrate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows we did not have any variablerate borrowings at december 31 2019  at december 31 2019  we maintained 3038 million of commercial paper commercial paper is considered a fixed rate borrowing however because maturities for commercial paper are generally less than 90 days commercial paper is considered subject to interest rate fluctuations 

credit risk 

cme clearing house 

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through third party exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for exchangetraded and interest rate swaps products for clearing firms we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk we establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity we marktomarket open positions of clearing firms at least once a day twice a day for futures and options contracts and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value we have the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant these practices allow our clearing house to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity 

despite our safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

we maintain two separate financial safeguard packages 

 in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for clearing membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit 

we maintain a 70 billion 364day multicurrency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or us treasury securities performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day multicurrency 

line of credit we also have the option to use our 24 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default 

at december 31 2019  aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for both financial safeguard packages was  1545 billion including cash performance bond deposits noncash deposits interest earnings facility funds and letters of credit a defaulting firms performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm 

the following shows the available assets at december 31 2019 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets 

 

 

the following shows the available assets for the interest rate swap financial safeguard package at december 31 2019 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears interest rate swap contracts after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets 

 

 brokertec americas matched principal business 

brokertec americas maintains a matched principal business where it serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement brokertec americas uses fixed income clearing corporation ficc a thirdparty central clearing house as well as a thirdparty clearing bank for the settlement of transactions and is required to post shortterm margin requirements twice a day that can vary based on the size of unsettled transactions and any adverse market changes at december 31 2019  the balance of the collateral at ficc was 1000 million which was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 

without sufficient funds to meet its obligations brokertec americas could be exposed to risk of breach of contract with the counterparties and the inability to continue as a member of the thirdparty central clearing house transactions with clearing house members are typically confirmed and novated shortly after execution at which point the clearing house assumes the risk of settlement for transactions with counterparties that are not members of the thirdparty clearing house settlement typically occurs on the day following execution and prior to settlement brokertec americas is exposed to the risk of loss in the event a 

counterparty fails to meet its obligations if that were to occur brokertec americas would have the right to cover or liquidate the open position but could incur a loss as a result of market movements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on monetary assets liabilities revenues and expenses held at subsidiaries where those balances and activity are denominated in a currency other than the subsidiarys functional currency gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result primarily from cash debt and other monetary assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in british pounds euros and japanese yen 

aggregate transaction gains losses for 2019  2018 and 2017 were 72 million 736 million and 94 million respectively we expect the foreign currency gainloss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold monetary assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries on january 31 2020 the united kingdom uk formally withdrew from the european union eu after a majority of voters in the uk approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit continues to generate economic and political uncertainty throughout the world particularly throughout the uk and the eu this uncertainty could potentially lead to significant volatility with foreign currency exchange rates which could result in additional foreign currency gainloss 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets liabilities revenues and expenses from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we report on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income the financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income aggregate translation gains losses net of tax for 2019  2018 and 2017 were 06 million  25 million and 75 million  respectively 

foreign currency exchange risk related to customer collateral 

a portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in various foreign currencies we marktomarket all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price therefore our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results

our strategic initiatives 

the following is a description of our strategic initiatives 

maximize futures and options on futures growth globally —  we continue to focus on driving growth and new customer acquisition growing innovating and scaling our core offerings and increasing participation from nonus customers we do this by crossselling our products expanding the strength of our existing benchmark products launching new products and services and deepening open interest in our core futures and options on futures offerings during this decade our key product launches have included the ultra us treasury bond futures and options and most recently the ultra 10year treasury futures shortdated options across asset classes new base metal products expanded crude oil grades basis trade at index close btic transactions sp dividend futures emini russell 1000 and 2000 futures and a cashsettled bitcoin futures contract we continued to build traction in key product launches in 2018 including our secured overnight financing rate sofr futures contracts sterling overnight index average sonia futures contracts cme fx link cme eris interest rate swap futures and physical wti houston crude oil contracts during 2018 we experienced overall record average daily volume of 192 million contracts along with multiple volume records across our core product portfolio including interest rates fx agricultural commodities and metals we also had record volume in overall options with electronic options representing 66 of total options volume in 2018 we continued to deepen liquidity and add diverse participation as evidenced by the growth in large open interest holders with records achieved across several product lines in 2018 

we also continued to expand and diversify our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world the most broadly diversified portfolio of benchmark products we believe we have significant opportunity to expand the participation of our nonus customer base in our markets we are focused on core growth in global markets because we believe that australia asia latin america and other emerging markets will experience significant growth and development of their financial markets in addition we continue to expand our presence in major global financial centers including europe grow our business outside the united states and penetrate emerging markets such as china south korea brazil and mexico in 2018 approximately 25 of our electronic futures and options on futures volume was from transactions reported as outside the united states and approximately 50 of our market data revenue was derived from outside the united states we also achieved 42 growth in trading volume during asian trading hours and 29 growth during european trading hours in 2018 compared to the 2017 

we continue to target crossasset sales across client segments driving international sales and generating new client participation across all regions we have a long history of providing customer value and responsiveness and believe our products and services well position us to help our customers adapt and comply with new regulations while enabling them to efficiently manage their risks we have a broad distribution network comprised of a combination of internal and external channels and frontend capabilities 

diversify our business and revenues — our acquisition of nex strengthens our role in the global market infrastructure adding complementary cash and otc businesses and scale to our listed interest rate and fx products while enabling new efficiencies for the derivatives marketplace the transaction positions cme group to take direct advantage of growth in treasury issuance liquid treasury holdings and the trading of treasury instruments as well as growing repo activity across geographies the transaction significantly expands cme group’s position in the large and highly fragmented 5 trillion plus per trading day global fx marketplace offering both order book trading and relationship trading solutions for customers the acquisition adds strength in underlying customer marketplaces especially around regional bank customers and other market 

 7 

participants outside of north america the acquisition also expands our posttrade services and market data solutions beyond futures and options on futures into cash and otc offerings 

our joint venture with sp global inc spdji indices llc combines the world class capabilities of sp indices and dow jones indices and is a significant player in the passive investing including the exchangetraded fund etf industry value chain as part of the joint venture we acquired a longterm ownershiplinked exclusive license to list futures and options on futures based on the sp 500 index and certain other sp indices 

deliver unparalleled capital and cost efficiency solutions —  with changing regulatory capital requirements for many of our customers and the need for greater efficiencies we have added tools to enable customers to build and manage trading and clearing positions in our markets in an efficient manner including through our acquisition of nex with the ongoing implementation of regulatory reform in the united states and in europe along with global implementation of basel iii capital requirements on financial institutions we expect capital efficiencies and centralized clearing to continue to be important for our global client base 

we provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the market for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing house our clearing services offer the ability to optimize collateral and capital efficiencies across portfolios within the clearing house while meeting the heightened regulatory requirements on derivatives the majority of our clearing volumes and activities are related to our listed futures and options on futures which also represents the majority of our open interest and collateral held against these positions we also offer clearing services for interest rate fx and commodity swaps in march 2018 we extended block trading to agricultural commodity products through cme clearport also in 2018 we extended our otc clearing solutions to include clearing for the chilean and columbian peso interest rate swaps

patents trademarks and licenses 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we also own the copyright to a variety of materials those copyrights some of which are registered include printed and online publications websites advertisements educational material graphic presentations and other literature both textual and electronic we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks patents copyrights database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods 

we offer equity index futures and options on key benchmarks including sp nasdaq dow jones and the ftse russell indexes these products are listed by us subject to license agreements with the applicable owners of the indexes some of which are exclusive in connection with our joint venture with sp global inc we entered into a new license agreement sp license agreement which superseded our prior licensing arrangements and was assigned to the joint venture cme’s license for the sp 500 index will be exclusive for futures and options on futures until one year prior to the termination of the sp license agreement and nonexclusive for the last year the license for the other sp stock indexes is generally exclusive for futures and options on futures the term of the sp license agreement will continue until the date that is one year after the date that cme group ceases to own at least five percent accounting for dilution of the outstanding joint venture interests upon the occurrence of certain events including certain terminations of the joint venture the term may be extended up to an additional ten years cbot has an exclusive license agreement dow jones license agreement with cme group index services llc cme indexes for certain dow jones indexes which has also been assigned to the joint venture the initial term of the agreement is through june 30 2026 following the initial term the dow jones license agreement shall automatically renew for renewal terms of five years thereafter so long as there is open interest in any of cbot’s or its affiliates’ products based on one or more of the dow jones licensed indexes in the event there is no open interest in any such products then cme indexes has the ability to terminate the agreement we also have an exclusive license agreement for certain nasdaq indexes which was extended for an additional ten years in 2018 through 2029 in 2015 we entered into an exclusive license agreement with ftse russell and launched the emini russell 2000 futures in 2017 we pay the applicable third party per trade fees based on contract volume under the terms of these licensing agreements a copy of the sp license arrangement has been filed as a material contract 

 8 

we also have a longterm nonexclusive licensing arrangement with ice benchmark administration for the use of libor to settle several of our interest rate products including our eurodollar contract 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with sp dow jones nasdaq and ftse russell or be able to maintain our other existing licensing arrangements beyond the term of the current agreements in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments including securities and options based on the sp dow jones nasdaq or russell indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties also may succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond our jurisdictional reach andor our licensors 

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify and become more global especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank european market infrastructure regulation emir markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii capital requirements directive iv crd iv market abuse regulation benchmarks regulation basel iii and various other laws and regulations 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 13 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties 

competition in our derivatives exchange business 

we believe competition in the derivatives business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse and complementary product offerings frequency and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from others in the industry we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality maintain liquidity and low transaction costs continue to strengthen our risk management capabilities and solutions and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers 

we compete in a large financial services trading clearing and settlement marketplace globally our competitors include among other entities exchanges such as intercontinental exchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited and deutsche börse ag it also includes alternative means of developing exposures through alternative instruments such as cash otc etfs options warrants contracts for differences structured products and other offerings new emerging competitors have targeted different segments of our industry and new technologies may offer alternative products in the future competition in our industry continues to be dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business 

competition in our cme clearing business 

in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with compliance with doddfrank basel iii mifid ii and other various laws and regulations 

 9 

our competitors in the clearing services space include among others companies such as ice lchgroup the options clearing corporation depository trust  clearing corporation and deutsche börse ag in light of the implementation of regulatory requirements and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing and other related posttrade services 

we believe competition in clearing services is based on among other things the value of providing customers with capital and margin efficiencies quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house timely delivery of the services reputation diversity of the service offerings confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the fees charged for the services provided 

competition in our cash markets business 

the cash markets businesses operate with significant competition across a wide array of venues in the fx space the marketplace is highly fragmented and there is competition from other electronic communication networks single dealer platforms bank owned multiparticipant platforms streaming and request for quote services trading venues tied to data platforms voice brokers other broker enabled platforms and other venues there is a growing array of platforms and they are often owned by many well capitalized financial institutions and intermediaries in the fixed income space there are also multiple providers of treasury european and us repo and european bond trading and a multitude of competitors and new entrants offering single dealer liquidity bank owned multiparticipant platforms streaming and request for quote services and other broker and exchangeenabled platforms 

competition in our optimization services business 

the optimization services business has significant competition across each of the segments in which cme group operates there are multiple providers of compression services reconciliation services trade processing analytics and regulatory reporting services in addition there is considerable innovation going on in this business with new entrants and new technologies being developed to serve customers 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products although we may receive license fees for such products such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable product 

regulatory matters 

our businesses are either regulated themselves or serving a customerbase that includes regulated institutions or individuals developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly affect our businesses as such we are subject to extensive regulation primarily in the united states and europe 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which uk voters voted in favor of withdrawal from the european union brexit which continues to create a number of uncertainties for the financial services sector we intend to establish certain businesses in a european union jurisdiction which will allow them to continue to provide services to european union clients following brexit separately the european commission european council and european parliament are considering legislation emir 22 that could make changes to the eu equivalence and recognition regime for noneuropean union clearing houses including cme clearing as further discussed below 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 13 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties 

regulation of our derivatives business cme clearing and nex sef 

our operation of us futures exchanges cme clearing and the nex swap execution facility sef is subject to extensive regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc that requires our regulated subsidiaries to satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures and swaps markets and clearing houses in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank 

regulations implementing doddfrank include rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain otc derivatives swap reporting operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting product definitions the definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets swap execution facilities and swap data repositories we continue to believe these regulations provide opportunities for our business which we continue to explore 

 10 

cme has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization these designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities by the cftc and the federal reserve board 

in connection with the global offering of our products and clearing services this business is also subject to the rules and regulations of the local jurisdictions in which we conduct business including the european securities and markets authority esma and the united kingdom financial conduct authority fca

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market economic and political conditions that are beyond our control and that could significantly impact our business and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially derived from fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets the trading volumes in our markets are directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 



 13 

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however as evidenced by our past performance in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital the shifts in market trading patterns we experienced as a result of the financial crisis of 2008 may or may not recur in the future and our business will be affected by future economic uncertainties which may result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us a reduction in overall trading volume or in certain products could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transactionbased revenue material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states and europe as a result of our global operations we are also subject to the rules and regulations of the local jurisdictions in which we conduct business and offer our products and services 

due to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 the united states and numerous other governments have undertaken reviews of the legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of debating or enacting new laws and regulations that will impact our business we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the extensive regulations that apply to our business additionally regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally such as enhanced capital requirements may adversely impact their trading activity in our markets also as noted above emir 22 the legislation being considered by the european commission european council and european parliament and the implementation of the regulations under this legislation have the potential to increase our regulatory costs andor create a disincentive for certain clients to use our products the eu equivalence and recognition regime also has the potential to impact the cost and ease or difficulty for certain of nex’s otc execution platforms to provide access to customers on a global basis 

to the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market derivatives clearing organization swap execution facility or brokerdealer 

legislation may be proposed both domestically and internationally that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets if such proposals were to become law they could have a negative impact on our industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants which may reduce trading and could make our markets less competitive 

please see item 1 – business – regulatory matters beginning on page 10 for additional information on our areas of regulatory focus 

we face intense competition from other companies if we are not able to successfully compete   our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe portions of doddfrank and the corresponding regulations with respect to mandatory clearing and organized trading provide opportunities for our business however other reforms could negatively impact our business and our ability to compete effectively we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and in some cases operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges otc markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large industry participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do 

our competitors may

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our fees or loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

please see item 1 – business – competition beginning on page 9 for additional information on the competitive environment and its potential impact on our business 

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume in our markets to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution and clearing facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies in the past such as lowering the fees that they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity payments or rebates we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to expand our products and services that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our trading volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of trading volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected furthermore declines in trading volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of trading volume 

our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyber security threats which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in substantial liabilities we also could be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems andor investigate any alleged attack 

we regard the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to targeted attacks unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism ransom attacks firewall or encryption failures and other security problems criminal groups political activist groups and nationstate actors have targeted the financial services industry and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other information security threats while the company has not experienced cyber incidents that are individually or in the aggregate material the company has experienced cyber attacks of varying degrees in the past the company has designed its cyber defense program to mitigate such attacks by preventative detective and responsive measures our usage of mobile and cloud technologies may increase our risk for a cyber attack our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our technology systems and data or our customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the services we provide that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while resulting in regulatory penalties or the imposition of burdensome obligations by regulators in addition as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business including the european union general data protection regulation that went into effect in may 

 15 

2018 compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs and may carry significant penalties for noncompliance 

additionally the operation of our technology platforms may place us at greater risk for misappropriation of our intellectual property and persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use or steal our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations in the past we have been the victim of trade secret theft by an employee 

as part of our global information security program we employ resources to monitor and protect our technology infrastructure and employees against such cyber attacks including the rapid response to zeroday vulnerabilities and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property assets however our security measures or those of our thirdparty providers including any cloudbased technologies may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed any security attack or breach could result in system failures and delays loss of customers and lower trading volume loss of competitive position damage to our reputation disruption of our business legal liability or regulatory fines significant costs which in turn may cause our revenues and earnings to decline though we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential commodity and securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while our derivatives exchange and clearing activities generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on the ability to bring private causes of actions in cases where we have not acted in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated andor direct actions brought by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction or that we failed to effectively fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities we may be subject to disputes regarding the quality of trade execution the settlement of trades or other matters relating to our services we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation to the extent we are found to have failed to fulfill our regulatory obligations we could lose our authorizations or licenses or become subject to conditions that could make future operations more costly and impair our profitability 

some of cme clearings largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

our clearing house seeks to offer customers intermediaries and clearing firms universal access in order to maximize the efficient use of capital exercise appropriate oversight of value at risk and maintain operating leverage from clearing activities on our exchanges our strategic business plan is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business some of our clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions of futures or options on futures from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our revenues and profits could be adversely affected 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on our industry generally or on our business while we have implemented significant physical security protection measures   business continuity plans and established backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such attack may result in the closure of our facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively

affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to our business 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

maintaining our reputation and brand is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our business prospects these issues may include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a including risks from customer disputes system failures or intrusions failures to meet our regulatory obligations failures of a clearing firm or other counterparty issues relating to our thirdparty suppliers misconduct and ineffective risk management 

the success of our markets depends on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces for a wide range of products that have the required functionality performance capacity security and speed to attract and retain customers in 2018 90 of our overall volume was generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform in connection with the acquisition of nex we acquired the brokertec and ebs trading platforms which will eventually be migrated to cme globex 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platforms and other technology offerings to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading systems and technology offerings if we are unable to develop them to include other products and markets or if they do not have the required functionality performance capacity security and speed desired by our customers our ability to successfully compete and our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

our business is highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor on a daily basis a large number of transactions which occur at high volume and frequencies across multiple systems we are heavily reliant on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations our systems or those of our thirdparty providers including cloud providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 



 17 

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error on our part or on the part of our vendors natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyber attacks acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems or the systems of our thirdparty providers do not operate properly are compromised or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platforms and technology offerings or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

regulations relating to our derivatives exchange and clearing business generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume similarly our brokertec and ebs trading platforms are expected by our customers to be regularly available and able to handle peak volumes heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in contract volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of our platforms system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and as we execute our business strategy although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

we as well as many of our customers depend on thirdparty suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors cloud hosting providers data center providers and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our trading platforms and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased trading volume lower revenues and higher costs 

 18 

certain businesses acquired from nex subject us to compliance and regulatory risks associated with being a regulated intermediary 

regulatory oversight of our business has historically been extensive and focused on the adequacy of our selfregulatory oversight of our derivatives exchange and clearing activities and the security and safeguards of our systems the brokerdealer and multilateral trading facility businesses acquired from nex brokertec and ebs are also extensively regulated but with a focus on their role as intermediaries which may create compliance and regulatory risks different than those to which we previously have been subject these regulatory obligations generally include proper licensing and qualification of the firms and individuals substantive conduct standards communication and disclosure rules monitoring and surveillance training capital requirements supervisory obligations maintenance of an antimoney laundering program suspicious activity reporting risk management standards trade reporting and ongoing examinations and reviews the risks from failing to meet these compliance and regulatory obligations include potential liability disciplinary action against the firm and individuals monetary penalties and restrictions on future activities 

our business exposes us to substantial credit risk of our clearing firms and other counterparties and consequently a decrease in their financial resources could adversely affect us 

in our derivatives business our clearing house operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles we routinely guarantee transactions submitted by our clearing firms with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one or more of our clearing firms additionally we are exposed to the risk of loss from the failure of a matched principal counterparty to settle its trades at brokertec 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations additionally brokertec is exposed to the potential risk of loss in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms and other counterparties can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a fund currently 980 million to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to qualified family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances if their derivatives clearing firm member becomes insolvent 

our brokertec matched principal business is highly dependent on our status as a member in good standing of the fixed income clearing corporation ficc and our failure to maintain that status could adversely affect us 

brokertec’s matched principal platform facilitates anonymous trading in significant volumes from wholesale market participants who are ficc members and understand that brokertec is also a ficc member such that their trades are expected to be novated promptly to ficc who will be their ultimate counterparty a failure of brokertec to maintain its membership could adversely impact the willingness of such participants to continue trading on the platform as part of maintaining its membership brokertec is required to timely and fully meet all margin calls and other obligations established by ficc and as such must maintain ready access to sufficient liquidity to satisfy those obligations brokertec maintains access to liquidity resources that it believes will satisfy these obligations in normal and stressed circumstances but there can be no guarantee that it will never experience a shortfall 

our threemonth eurodollar futures contracts are based on the threemonth us dollar libor underlying rate to the extent trading in eurodollar contracts decreases and our alternative contracts are not successful our revenues would be negatively impacted certain of our other businesses could also be negatively affected by changes to libor 

our eurodollar futures contracts are based on the threemonth us dollar ice libor libor underlying rate in 2018 average trading volume in our eurodollar contracts was 45 million contracts and open interest was 539 million contracts libor is the subject of recent national and international proposals for reform which advocate for the transition of survey based interbank offered rates to alternative transactionbased reference rates in particular on july 27 2017 the chief executive of the fca which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading banks to submit rates for the calibration of libor to the administrator of libor after 2021 the announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021 while we are closely engaged with the industry regulators and market participants to launch products using alternative reference rates including our sofr and sonia futures contracts launched in 2018 there is no guarantee that a transition to such contracts would be successful and would replace the revenue we derive from our eurodollar contracts if the trading volume were to decline or discontinue altogether additionally certain of our other businesses including our reset offering could be negatively affected by changes to libor 

 19 

the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market 

to become a clearing member at our clearing house a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit collateral to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and select etfs foreign sovereign debt canadian provincials and corporate bonds and subject them to established haircuts based on the type of collateral and maturity there is no guarantee the collateral will maintain its value to the extent a clearing firm is not compliant with capital margin or guaranty fund requirements it would be required to promptly come into compliance by adding capital or collateral decreasing its proprietary trading activity andor transferring customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our derivatives products 

intellectual property rights licensed from thirdparty price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue regulatory scrutiny into such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products 

we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from thirdparty price reporting agencies to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily susceptible to manipulation our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenues 

our market data revenues may be reduced by decreased demand poor overall economic conditions regulatory changes or a significant change in how market participants trade and use market data 

we sell our market data to individuals trading institutions and other organizations that use our information services to participate in our markets andor monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data and information services represented 10  and 11  of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively a decrease in overall trading volume may lead to a decreased demand for our market data for example in recent years we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data connections due to continued economic uncertainty high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms and the continued impact of legacy incentive programs tied to trading terminals we could also become subject to regulatory actions which could have the potential to restrict how we charge for our market data we also license our market data to be used in the creation of derivative financial products and changes to regulation including the impact of any changes in laws or government policy may impact the demand of our market data for such derivative works 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the otc markets and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances our growth strategy also may subject us to increased legal compliance and regulatory obligations unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions other investments and strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of historical merger and acquisition activity in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us which could impact our ability to identify growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration also may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly 

 20 

formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from our growth initiatives and investments which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we also may be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively affect our stock price our recent acquisition of nex is subject to many of these risks including the potential we may not achieve the expected cost savings synergies and other strategic benefits from the transaction within the anticipated time frames and the integration of nex with our operations may not be successful or may be delayed or more costly than expected or that our customers will be negatively affected by these changes 

expansion of our global operations involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our global operations including through our acquisition of nex we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in our regulated businesses these risks include 

 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in marketing our products and services in international markets we also may experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of fx risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

the ultimate impact of brexit is contingent upon the terms of withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the uk and the european union brexit may result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the withdrawal process progresses additionally the establishment of certain of our businesses in a european union jurisdiction will result in increased legal compliance and operational costs 

our compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators including during regulatory examinations or we may otherwise become subject to their inquiry and oversight our regulators have broad enforcement powers including the power to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our regulatory designations or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business for example in 2013 the cftc filed suit against nymex and two former employees alleging disclosure of confidential customer information in violation of the commodity exchange act based on our review of the allegations we believe that we have strong factual and legal defenses to the claim 

we maintain policies and procedures to prevent detect monitor and manage our risks but such policies and procedures may not be fully effective some of our risk management processes depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers employees or other matters or potential threats that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal and compliance regulatory reputational and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

 21 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in the past misconduct by our employees and agents could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability 

we could be harmed by misconduct occurring on our otc trading platforms 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving manipulative activity or other misconduct in the otc markets by wholesale market participants improper activity on our platform could include activities such as spoofing layering wash trading and manipulation such misconduct could subject us to financial losses and seriously harm our reputation and could also result in regulatory sanctions financial penalties and restrictions on our activities for failure to properly identify monitor and respond to potentially problematic activity it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example one of our former employees pleaded guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we might still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 44 billion  of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 20 billion  

 22 

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our us exchanges swap execution facility and clearing house also are required to maintain minimum capital levels as defined by the cftc and our brokertec brokerdealer is required to meet minimum capital requirements set by the sec 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the past we have experienced ratings downgrades our failure to maintain our ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital additionally if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of our fixedrate notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

our operations of and investments in businesses outside of the united states subject us to currency risk 

as a global company with operations outside of the united states which have expanded as a result of our nex acquisition portions of our revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the particular subsidiary because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

our average rate per contract for our derivatives business is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract for our derivatives business which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability would be adversely affected 

eleven of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our derivatives exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with the cme members rights to elect six directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business

eleven of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members in 2018  84  of our derivatives contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result members may not have the same economic interests as holders of our class a common stock in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their methods of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry for options products still meeting certain volume thresholds and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our exchange members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent we have limited ability to eliminate these election rights in 2018 we held a special meeting of shareholders to eliminate all or some of these director election rights while the proposal received majority support it failed to achieve the required support under delaware law from a majority of the outstanding owners of the class b common stock in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend introduction 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is organized as follows 

 on november 2 2018 we completed our acquisition of nex group plc nex the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes the financial results of nex beginning on november 3 2018 

references in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to cme group inc cme group and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively references to “exchange” are to chicago mercantile exchange inc cme the board of trade of the city of chicago inc cbot new york mercantile exchange inc nymex commodity exchange inc comex and nex collectively unless otherwise noted 

executive summary 

business overview 

cme group a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for cme cbot nymex comex nex and their respective subsidiaries the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme groups class a common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol cme 

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts we also clear futures options on futures and swaps contracts through our clearing house futures contracts options on futures contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial derivatives institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equity indexes foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals through our acquisition of nex we now offer fixed income trading through brokertec and foreign currency trading through ebs which are both included in the cash markets business our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platforms these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house 

through the acquisition with nex we now provide optimization services that deliver transaction lifecycle management and information services to help our customers optimize their capital mitigate their risk and reduce operational costs optimization services includes traiana and trioptima 

our clearing house clears settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges in addition to cleared swaps products our clearing houses performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our 

 29 

clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies certain brokertec and ebs contracts are cleared at thirdparty clearing houses 

business trends 

economic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite economic uncertainty and volatility trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the united states and european credit crises fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the federal reserve bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment  our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry competition is influenced by our brand and reputation the efficiency and security of our services depth and liquidity of our markets diversity of product offerings including rate and quality of new product development and innovative services our ability to position and expand upon existing products efficient and seamless customer experience transparency reliability and anonymity of transaction processing the regulatory environment connectivity accessibility flexibility in execution methods efficient and innovative technology and connectivity as well as transaction costs we believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges clearing organizations swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as markets continue to evolve we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers 

regulatory environment  exchangetraded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly impact our business compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability the regulatory environment to which we are subject is discussed in item 1 business on page 10 

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on maximizing futures and options growth globally diversifying our business and revenues and delivering unparalleled capital and cost efficiency solutions we focus specifically on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes our strategic initiatives are discussed in item 1 business on page 7 

revenues 

clearing and transaction fees  a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for exchangetraded and overthecounter contracts because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue 



 30 

rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts fee limits and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

product mix we offer exchangetraded futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearedonly interest rate swap contracts through our acquisition of nex we also offer foreign exchange spot and forward contracts and fixed income products rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products 

venue our exchange and platforms are an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our cme electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

clearing and transaction fees for cash markets business  our cash markets business provides matching services whereby we match a buyer and seller of financial instruments to allow both parties to complete the trade bilaterally or through a thirdparty clearing house we are not involved in the settlement of the contract but charge a transaction fee generally based on volume or notional value of the trade for providing the matching service the cash markets business also includes brokertec us which generates revenue from a matched principal business matched principal trades involve brokertec us purchasing a financial instrument from one market participant and selling it to another market participant revenue is generated from this business generally on a transaction fee basis 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services and other various services related to our exchange operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third party distributors 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotations trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

other revenues other revenue includes access and communication fees access and communication fees are connectivity fees charged to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services our communication services include our colocation program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers 

beginning on november 3 2018 other revenues include revenues from nexs optimization services which include fees for risk management and information services for the overthecounter markets including portfolio reconciliation and posttrade processing revenue earned from these services is typically generated through subscriptions or transaction fees 

other revenues also include fees for posttrade services fees for collateral management equity subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms 

 31 

expenses 

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume however licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity energy and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

in general stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices as part of the acquisition of nex some of the expense associated with nex awards will be settled in cash 

professional fees and outside services  this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives regulatory and other compliance matters temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements furniture fixtures and equipment this expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of cbot holdings inc nymex holdings inc and nex as well as other asset and business acquisitions intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm market data and other customer relationships 

other expenses we incur additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 

 32 

nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include noncore investing and financing activities 

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value 

 for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for 

 33 

impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives 

revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests 

income taxes  calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs  certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized we also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained in the cloud software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally two to four years amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use

results of operations 

financial highlights 

the following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented 



revenues 



clearing and transaction fees 

futures and options   

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract for futures and options total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain clearedonly contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures below exclude trading volume for the cash markets business as well as credit default swaps and interest rate swaps 



we estimate the following increases decreases in clearing and transaction fees based on changes in total contract volume and changes in average rate per contract during 2018  compared with 2017  and during 2017  compared with 2016  



average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure including volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the 

 35 

relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation 

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume contract volume can be influenced by many factors including political and economic factors the regulatory environment and market competition 



overall contract volume increased from 2016 through 2018 overall market volatility remained high throughout the last two years as the markets continued to experience uncertainty surrounding the federal reserves interest rate policy the united states foreign trade policies and future rates of inflation throughout 2017 and 2018 the federal open markets committee raised the federal funds rate seven times but raised the expectation of slower rate increases in 2019 we believe these factors led to the overall increases in contract volumes from 2016 to 2018 

interest rate products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years   

from 2016 to 2018 overall interest rate contract volumes increased due to volatility caused by continued uncertainty surrounding the federal reserves interest rate policy including volatility resulting from the federal open markets committee raising the federal funds rate seven times in 2017 and 2018 we also believe the increases in contract volumes were due to volatility caused by increased issuance of us treasury bills by the us department of treasury as well as increased 

 36 

uncertainty surrounding the united states foreign trade policies future rates of inflation and the potential for increased government spending 

equity index products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity index products 



in 2018 when compared with 2017 the increase in equity index contract volume was largely attributable to periods of higher equity market volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index and the cboe nasdaq100 volatility index throughout 2018 we believe the higher volatility was caused by greater market uncertainty including uncertainty surrounding the united states foreign trade policies and other political and economic policies of the united states 

the decrease in overall equity index contract volume in 2017 when compared with 2016 resulted from periods of lower equity market volatility the comparatively low volatility was believed to be caused by fewer marketmoving geopolitical and macrolevel events that impacted these indexes in 2017 during 2016 there were periods of higher volatility within the equity markets due to uncertainty regarding the federal open markets committees decision to start raising interest rates in 2016 the deceleration of the chinese economy the results of the us presidential and congressional elections and declining global crude oil prices 

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products 



foreign exchange contract volumes increased from 2016 through 2018 primarily due to higher euro contract volumes resulting from market uncertainty caused by differences in monetary policies by the european central bank and the federal reserve we believe the increases in british pound contract volumes were attributable to the ongoing uncertainty from the united kingdom european union membership referendum as well as the potential for future interest rate hikes japanese yen contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 as market participants turned to the yen as a safehaven currency when currency rates steadied but decreased in 2018 due to stagnant economic growth for japan in 2018 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products 



in 2018 when compared with 2017 the increase in agricultural commodity contract volume was due to periods of higher price volatility throughout 2018 which we believe resulted from uncertainty surrounding crop production due to drought conditions in both south america and australia we also believe the increase in contract volume was attributable to volatility caused by concern surrounding the united states foreign trade policies 

 37 

agricultural commodity contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 largely due to higher corn and wheat volumes resulting from greater uncertainty related to weather conditions in 2017 the increase was partially offset by lower soybean volume due to lower uncertainty related to expectations of crop production versus 2016 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products 



in 2018 when compared with 2017 overall energy contract volume remained relatively flat crude oil contract volume remained flat due to lower price volatility which we believe was the result of stability within the crude oil markets as supply was meeting global demand 

overall energy contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 largely due to an increase in crude oil contract volume caused by higher volatility in 2017 we believe the increased volatility was caused by a shift in crude oil supplies as united states crude oil production rose along with the organization of petroleum exporting countries decision to cut oil supplies in the fourth quarter of 2016 natural gas and refined products contract volumes also increased in 2017 due to higher price volatility caused by shifts in supply and demand in the underlying markets 

metal products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products 



the overall increases in metal contract volumes from 2016 to 2018 were due to investors using gold and other precious metals as safehaven alternative investments to other markets we believe the increases in metal contract volumes were driven by consistent periods of high price volatility within other markets caused by the uncertainties surrounding the policies of the political administration in the united states and future rates of inflation 

average rate per contract 

the slight decrease in average rate per contract in 2018 when compared with 2017 was largely due to a shift in product mix interest rate and equity contract volumes collectively increased by 4 percentage points as a percentage of total volume while energy and agricultural commodity contract volumes collectively decreased by 3 percentage points in general interest rate and equity products have a lower rate per contract compared with energy and agricultural commodity products the decrease resulting from a shift in product mix was partially offset by lower incentives 

the average rate per contract decreased in 2017 when compared with 2016 due to a shift in product mix as interest rate volume increased by 2 percentage points as a percentage of total volume while equity contract volume decreased by 3 percentage points in general interest rate products have a lower rate per contract compared with equity contracts the overall decrease in average rate per contract was partially offset by a rate increase that was effective in the first quarter of 2017 and lower incentives 

cash markets business 

total clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2018 includes transaction fees of 912 million attributable to businesses acquired from nex for the period of november 3 2018 through december 31 2018 this revenue includes 329 million in transaction fees from brokertec uss fixed income volume and 375 million from ebss foreign exchange volume 

 38 

the related average daily notional value for november 3 2018 through december 31 2018 were as follows 



concentration of revenue 

we bill a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 10 of our clearing and transaction fee revenue in 2018 one firm represented 13 and another firm represented 12 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2017 one firm represented 13 and another firm represented 11 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2016 should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm 

other sources of revenue 

market data and information services in 2018 when compared with 2017 the increase in market data and information services revenue was attributable to an increase in fees for basic realtime market data service to 105 per month from 85 per month beginning in the second quarter of 2018 the increase was partially offset by modest declines in screen counts due to costcutting initiatives at member firms the increase in market data and information services revenue was also attributable to additional market data revenue generated by nex subsequent to the acquisition of nex on november 2 2018 

the decrease in market data and information services revenue in 2017 when compared with 2016 was due to a decline in screen counts from costcutting initiatives at member firms 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented in aggregate 41  45  and 40  of our market data and information services revenue in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 

other revenues the increase in other revenues for 2018 when compared with 2017 is largely attributable to the additional other revenue contributed by the nex acquisition other revenues from nex primarily include optimization services such as portfolio management analytics and trade and regulatory reporting

nonoperating income expense 



  

nm not meaningful 

investment income the increases in investment income from 2016 to 2018 were largely due to increases in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that are reinvested which primarily resulted from higher rates of interest earned on the cash account at the federal reserve bank of chicago in 2018 we recognized net realized and unrealized gains of 974 million on certain privatelyheld equity investments in 2017 we sold our remaining ownership interest in bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa and recognized a gain of 865 million net of transaction costs we also sold our 2 interest in bolsa mexicana de valores sab de cv and recognized a gain of 23 million net of transaction costs in 2016 we recognized a net gain of 484 million on sales of 280 million shares of our investment in bmfbovespa 

interest and other borrowing costs interest and other borrowing costs were higher in 2018 when compared with 2017 and 2016 due to the issuance of 5000 million of 375 fixed rate notes due june 2028 and 7000 million of 415 fixed rate notes due june 2048 during the second quarter of 2018 interest and other borrowing costs were also higher due to issuance of commercial paper and the assumption of the outstanding nex debt as part of the acquisition 

equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries higher income generated from our spdji business venture contributed to increases in equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries from 2016 through 2018 

other income expense from 2016 to 2018 we recognized higher expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms in 2018 we recognized net losses of 623 million on various derivative contracts which included our foreign exchange option and forward contracts used to mitigate certain exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation on the currency required to facilitate the nex acquisition as well as derivative contracts that we assumed in our acquisition of nex

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 



 

nm not meaningful 

in 2018 when compared with 2017 the effective tax rate increased primarily due to the remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities recognized in 2017 from the us income tax reform and state tax charges in 2018 related to the nex acquisition 

the overall decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 when compared with 2016 was primarily due to the remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities as a result of the us income tax reform the decrease was partially offset by expense from a state and local tax law change recorded in the third quarter of 2017 as well as from reclassifying income tax expense from other comprehensive income for the sale of the remaining bmfbovespa shares 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

we have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations while our cost structure is fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments however it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2018  these were as follows 

  

 operating leases include rent payments for office space in chicago new york and other smaller offices in the united states and in various foreign countries the operating lease for our headquarters in chicago expires in 2032 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 129 million  to 208 million  we also maintain operating leases for datacenter space in chicago which expires in march 2031 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from  168 million  to  183 million  the operating lease for our office space in new york expires in december 2028 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from  133 million  to  145 million  

purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements for advertising licensing hardware software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services debt obligations include repayment of principal and interest associated with the debt obligations other longterm liabilities include deferred payments for previous acquisitions completed by nex before being acquired by cme group 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity performance improvements as well as improvements to some of our office spaces each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data centers telecommunications network and other 

 42 

operating equipment in 2019  we expect capital expenditures to total approximately 1800 million to 1900 million we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders which is set at between 50 to 60 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant cme group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends on february 6 2019  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 075  per share the dividend will be payable on march 25 2019  to shareholders of record on march 8 2019  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately 2700 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 175 per share on december 5 2018 paid on january 16 2019 to the shareholders of record on december 28 2018 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results capitalization expenditures potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

sources and uses of cash 

the following is a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 

  

nm not meaningful 

operating activities 

the increases in net cash provided by operating activities from 2016 through 2018 were largely attributable to increases in trading volumes lower overall tax payments due to a reduction in the federal tax rate as well as higher investment income related to our reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranty fund collateral net of the distribution of interest earned to the clearing firms 

investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2018 when compared with 2017 was largely due to the cash consideration required for the acquisition of nex net of cash received 

the increase in cash provided by investing activities in 2017 when compared with 2016 was due to proceeds from the sale of bmfbovespa and bolsa mexicana de valores sab de cv shares 

financing activities 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2018 when compared with 2017 was due to proceeds from the debt offering in the second quarter of 2018 as well as the net proceeds from issuance of commercial paper which was used to finance the cash consideration for the acquisition of nex the decrease in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash dividends and the repayment of outstanding debt assumed in the acquisition of nex 

the increase in cash used by financing activities in 2017 when compared with 2016 was attributable to higher cash dividends declared in 2017 the increase was partially offset by proceeds from a finance lease obligation related to the sale leaseback of the datacenter in the first quarter of 2016

debt instruments 

the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2018  

  

  

 in june 2018 we completed offerings of 5000 million of 375 fixed rate notes due june 2028 and 7000 million of 415 fixed rate notes due june 2048 we used the net proceeds from the offering together with cash on hand to finance the cash consideration for the acquisition of nex in connection with the acquisition we issued commercial paper in the fourth quarter of 2018 and have an outstanding balance of 3899 million  at december 31 2018  the commercial paper is backed by the 24 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility 

as part of our acquisition of nex we assumed their outstanding debt which included a €3500 million eurobond maturing in march 2019 a ¥191 billion term loan maturing in march 2019 and a €150 million fixed rate note maturing in may 2023 nex maintained a £3500 million revolving credit facility that was paid down and terminated in november 2018 

we maintain a 24 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions which matures in november 2022 the proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at cme groups discretion and if necessary for maturities of commercial paper as long as we are not in default under this facility we have the option to increase it up to 30 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds this facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty under this facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test which is defined as our consolidated shareholders equity at september 30 2017 giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements and in no event greater than 20 billion in aggregate multiplied by 065 we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility but the outstanding commercial paper balance is backstopped against this facility 

we maintain a 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing the facility provides for borrowings of up to 70 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian for our collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or us treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility at december 31 2018  guaranty funds available to collateralize the facility totaled 74 billion we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion our 364day facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as cme consolidated shareholders equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 8000 million we 

 44 

currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility on november 1 2018 we amended and extended the agreement to include two extension dates which allow us to terminate or extend the agreement within six or nine months 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 24 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility and our 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility for 70 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

at december 31 2018  we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 20 billion  under our multicurrency revolving senior credit facility 

at december 31 2018  we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders

the following table summarizes our credit ratings as of december 31 2018  



given our cash flow generation our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities if necessary we expect to maintain an investment grade rating if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase our cme group fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined by securities and exchange commission rules and regulations 

liquidity and cash management 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 14 billion  at december 31 2018  and 19 billion  at december 31 2017  the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices a majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in us treasury securities us government agency securities and us treasury security reverse repurchase agreements our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that no contribution will be necessary in 2019  as we exceeded our funding goal by 507 million  in 2018 however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on various factors including the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2019  and the december 31 2019  discount rate

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2018  consisted of fixedrate borrowings of 44 billion  in us dollar equivalent changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixedrate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows we did not have any variablerate borrowings at december 31 2018  at december 31 2018  we maintained 3899 million  of commercial paper commercial paper is considered a fixed rate borrowing however because maturities for commercial paper are generally less than 90 days commercial paper is considered subject to interest rate fluctuations 

credit risk 

cme clearing house 

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through third party exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for exchangetraded and interest rate swaps products for clearing firms we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk we establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity we marktomarket open positions of clearing firms at least once a day twice a day for futures and options contracts and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value we have the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant these practices allow our clearing house to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity 

despite our safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

we maintain two separate financial safeguard packages 

 in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for clearing membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the 

 46 

respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit 

we maintain a 70 billion 364day multicurrency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or us treasury securities performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day multicurrency line of credit we also have the option to use our 24 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default 

at december 31 2018 aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for both financial safeguard packages was  1432 billion  including 382 billion  of cash performance bond deposits and 27 billion  of letters of credit a defaulting firms performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm 

the following shows the available assets at december 31 2018  in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets

 brokertec matched principal business 

brokertec maintains a matched principal business where it serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement brokertec uses fixed income clearing corporation ficc a thirdparty central clearing house as well as a thirdparty clearing 

 47 

bank for the settlement of transactions and is required to post shortterm margin requirements twice a day that can vary based on the size of unsettled transactions and any adverse market changes at december 31 2018 the balance of the collateral at ficc was 1000 million which was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 

without sufficient funds to meet its obligations brokertec could be exposed to risk of breach of contract with the counterparties and the inability to continue as a member of the thirdparty central clearing house transactions with clearing house members are typically confirmed and novated shortly after execution at which point the clearing house assumes the risk of settlement for transactions with counterparties that are not members of the clearing house settlement typically occurs on the day following execution and prior to settlement brokertec is exposed to the risk of loss in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations if that were to occur brokertec would have the right to cover or liquidate the open position but could incur a loss as a result of market movements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on monetary assets liabilities revenues and expenses held at subsidiaries where those balances and activity are denominated in a currency other than the subsidiarys functional currency gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result primarily from cash debt and other monetary assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in british pounds euros and japanese yen during 2018 we maintained a restricted cash balance of 16 billion held for the acquisition of nex which was denominated in british pounds this cash balance contributed to a significant portion of the net foreign currency transaction loss incurred in 2018 

in conjunction with the acquisition we assumed the outstanding debt of nex on the acquisition date which includes a €3500 million eurobond maturing in march 2019 a ¥191 billion term loan due in march 2019 and a €150 million fixed rate note maturing in may 2023 since the debt is denominated in euros and japanese yen we have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in these currencies until the debt is repaid we maintain a hedge contract on the exchange rate risk between the japanese yen and the british pound on the maturing principal and interest payments of the japanese yenbased term loan but we have foreign currency transaction risk between the us dollar and the british pound until the japanese yenbased term loan is repaid we also maintain a crosscurrency swap on part of the outstanding par value on our €3500 million eurobond maturing in march 2019 which swaps our eurobased principal and interest payments for british poundbased payments 

aggregate transaction gains losses for 2018  2017  and 2016  were 736 million 94 million and 245 million respectively we expect the foreign currency gainloss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold monetary assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets liabilities revenues and expenses from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we report on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income the financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income aggregate translation gains losses net of tax for 2018  2017  and 2016  were 25 million  75 million  and 69 million  respectively 

foreign currency exchange risk related to customer collateral 

a portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in various foreign currencies we marktomarket all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price therefore our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 87 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

we provide innovative ways to manage risk and offer a number of key differentiating elements that set us apart from others in our industry including 

highly liquid markets — our listed futures and options markets provide an effective forum for our customers to manage their risk and meet their investment needs relating to our markets we believe our customers choose to trade on our centralized market due to its liquidity and price transparency market liquidity — or the ability of a market to absorb the execution of large purchases or sales quickly and efficiently whereby the market recovers quickly following the execution of large orders — is key to attracting customers and contributing to a markets success 

 5 

most diverse product line — our products provide a means for hedging speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with among other things interest rate sensitive instruments equity ownership changes in the value of foreign currency and changes in the prices of agricultural energy and metal commodities the estimated percentage of clearing and transaction fees revenue contributed by each product line is as follows

2 privately negotiated average daily volume includes both traditional block trades offexchange trades which were historically categorized as cme clearport now executed as futures block trades and exchange for related positions efrp

are exclusive in connection with our joint venture with sp global inc we entered into a new license agreement sp license agreement which superseded our prior licensing arrangements and was assigned to the joint venture cme’s license for the sp 500 index will be exclusive for futures and options on futures until one year prior to the termination of the sp license agreement and nonexclusive for the last year the license for the other sp stock indexes is generally exclusive for futures and options on futures the term of the sp license agreement will continue until the date that is one year after the date that cme group ceases to own at least five percent accounting for dilution of the outstanding joint venture interests upon the occurrence of certain events including certain terminations of the joint venture the term may be extended up to an additional ten years cbot has an exclusive license agreement dow jones license agreement with cme group index services llc cme indexes for certain dow jones indexes which has also been assigned to the joint venture the initial term of the agreement is through june 30 2026 following the initial term the dow jones license agreement shall automatically renew for renewal terms of five years thereafter so long as there is open interest in any of cbot’s or its affiliates’ products based on one or more of the dow jones licensed indexes in the event there is no open interest in any such products then cme indexes has the ability to terminate the agreement we also have an exclusive license agreement for certain nasdaq indexes through 2019 in 2015 we entered into an exclusive license agreement with ftse russell and launched the emini russell 2000 futures in 2017 copies of our sp dow jones and nasdaq license arrangements have been filed as material contracts we pay the applicable third party per trade fees based on contract volume under the terms of these licensing agreements

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with sp dow jones nasdaq and ftse russell or be able to maintain our other existing licensing arrangements beyond the term of the current agreements in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments including securities and options based on the sp dow jones nasdaq or russell indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties also may succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond our jurisdictional reach andor our licensors 

working capital 

we generally meet our funding requirements with internally generated funds supplemented from time to time with public debt and commercial paper offerings for more information on our working capital needs see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources beginning on page 42 which section is incorporated herein by reference 

customer base 

our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers governments and central banks our customers can connect to our electronic trading platforms from access points across the globe customers may be members of one or more of our cme cbot nymex or comex exchanges rights to directly access our markets will depend upon the nature of the customer such as whether the individual is a member of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access 

us trading rights and privileges are exchangespecific open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members membership on one of our futures exchanges also enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections in 2017  83  of our contract volume was conducted by our members 

the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represents charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13  and another firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2017  in the event a clearing firm were to withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange 

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify and become more global especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank european market infrastructure regulation emir markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii capital requirements directive iv crd iv market abuse regulation benchmarks regulation basel iii and various other laws and regulations 

 9 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 14 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties 

competition in our derivatives business 

we believe competition in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from others in the industry we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality maintain liquidity and low transaction costs and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers 

we compete in a large financial services trading clearing and settlement marketplace globally our competitors include among other entities exchanges such as intercontinental exchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited and deutsche börse ag competition in our industry continues to be dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business 

competition in our transaction processing business 

in addition we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with compliance with doddfrank basel iii mifid ii and other various laws and regulations 

our competitors in the clearing services space include among others companies such as ice lchclearnet ltd the options clearing corporation depository trust  clearing corporation and deutsche börse ag in light of the implementation of regulatory requirements and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing and other related posttrade services 

we believe competition in transaction processing and business services is based on among other things the value of providing customers with capital and margin efficiencies quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house timely delivery of the services reputation diversity of the service offerings confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the fees charged for the services provided 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products although we may receive license fees for such products such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable product 

 10 

regulatory matters 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom and the european union we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges and other businesses to offer our products and services to their citizens 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 14 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties 

regulation in the united states 

our operation of us futures exchanges and our clearing house is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc that requires our regulated subsidiaries to satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures and swaps markets and clearing houses in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years following the enactment of doddfrank the cftc has moved from a principlesbased to a more prescriptive regulatory approach over most aspects of our trading and clearing operations 

regulations implementing doddfrank include rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain overthecounter derivatives swap reporting operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting product definitions the definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets swap execution facilities and swap data repositories we continue to believe these regulations provide opportunities for our business which we continue to explore 

our clearing house has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization these designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities by the federal reserve bank and the cftc 

our us swap data repository service and swap execution facility are also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc 

in february 2017 president trump signed an executive order calling for the current us presidential administration to review us financial laws and regulations to determine their consistency with a set of core principles identified in the order some areas identified as subject to potential change amendment or repeal include the doddfrank act and the authorities of the federal reserve and the financial stability oversight council we cannot predict which if any of these or other actions will be taken or if taken their effect on our business 

us income tax reform efforts could have a material impact on our business on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act was signed into law the 2017 tax act enacts broad changes to the existing us federal income tax code including reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 amongst many other complex provisions the ultimate impact of such tax reforms may differ from our current estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as the issuance of any further regulations or guidance that may alter the operation of the us federal income tax code various uncertainties also exist in terms of how us states and any foreign countries within which we operate will react to these us federal income tax reforms which could have additional impacts on our business 

regulation in the united kingdom and the european union 

in the united kingdom parts of our operations are subject to the oversight of esma and the fca our clearing house is subject to certain conditions and reporting obligations as a result of its recognition by esma multiple directives and regulations such as mifid ii and the markets in financial instruments regulation mifir the crd iv and the market abuse regulation have been implemented either in full or on a phased basis with provisions similar to those contained in doddfrank further regulation such as emir and the benchmarks regulation or changes to such legislation may impact our business and operations 

in june 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which uk voters voted in favor of withdrawal from the european union brexit the ultimate impact of brexit on the relevant law and scope of regulation applicable to our uk operations including the recognition of our clearing house is unclear and is contingent upon the terms of withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the united kingdom and the european union

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market economic and political conditions that are beyond our control and that could significantly reduce our contract volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially dependent on the contract volume in our markets our contract volume is directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however as evidenced by our past performance in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital the shifts in market trading patterns we experienced as a result of the financial disturbance of 2008 may or may not recur in the future and our business will be affected by future economic uncertainties which may result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states as a result of our global operations we are also subject to the rules and regulations of the local jurisdictions in which we conduct business including esma and the fca we also have obtained certain licenses from foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges and clearing house to offer our products and services to their citizens 

due to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 the united states and numerous other governments have undertaken reviews of the legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of debating or enacting new laws and regulations that will impact our business moreover in february 2017 president 

 14 

trump signed an executive order calling for the current us presidential administration to review us financial laws and regulations to determine their consistency with a set of core principles identified in the order some areas identified as subject to potential change amendment or repeal include the doddfrank act and the authorities of the federal reserve and financial stability oversight council in december 2017 the 2017 tax act was signed into law and the ultimate impact to our business remains uncertain while certain of these changes may have a positive impact on our business some of these changes could adversely affect our business including areas of regulatory focus discussed under item 1 – business – regulatory matters beginning on page 11 compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources that could result in some participants leaving our markets or decreasing their trading activity which would negatively affect our profitability we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the extensive regulations that apply to our business to the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete   our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe portions of doddfrank and the corresponding regulations with respect to mandatory clearing and organized trading provide opportunities for our business however other reforms could negatively impact our business and our ability to compete effectively we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and in some cases operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large industry participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do 

our competitors may 

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our fees or loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

please see item 1 – business – competition beginning on page 9 for additional information on the competitive environment and its potential impact on our business 

our contract volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our contract volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution and clearing facilities our success also 

 15 

depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies in the past such as lowering the fees that they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity payments or rebates we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13  and another firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2017  should a clearing firm withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange however there is the possibility we would lose a portion of the customer business additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our contract volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of contract volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected furthermore declines in contract volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of contract volume 

our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cyber security threats which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and contract volume and result in substantial liabilities we also could be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems andor investigate any alleged attack 

we regard the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to targeted attacks unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism ransom attacks firewall or encryption failures and other security problems criminal groups political activist groups and nationstate actors have targeted the financial services industry and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other information security threats while the company has not experienced cyber incidents that are individually or in the aggregate material the company has experienced cyber attacks of varying degrees in the past the company has designed its cyber defense program to mitigate such attacks by preventative detective and responsive measures our usage of mobile and cloud technologies may increase our risk for a cyber attack our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our technology systems and data or our customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the services we provide that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while resulting in regulatory penalties or the imposition of burdensome obligations by regulators in addition as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs and may carry significant penalties for noncompliance 

additionally our role as a leading derivatives marketplace and the operation of our technology platforms may place us at greater risk for misappropriation of our intellectual property and persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use or steal our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations in the past we have been the victim of trade secret theft by an employee 

as part of our global information security program we employ resources to monitor and protect our technology infrastructure and employees against such cyber attacks including the rapid response to zeroday vulnerabilities and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property assets however our security measures or those of our thirdparty providers including any cloudbased technologies may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed any security attack or breach could result in system failures and delays loss of customers and lower contract volume loss of competitive position damage to our reputation disruption of our business legal liability or regulatory fines significant costs which in turn may cause our revenues and earnings to decline though we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential commodity and securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while we generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on the ability to bring private causes of actions in cases where we have not acted in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws 

 16 

and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated andor direct actions brought by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction or that we failed to effectively fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities we may be subject to disputes regarding the quality of trade execution the settlement of trades or other matters relating to our services we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation to the extent we are found to have failed to fulfill our regulatory obligations we could lose our authorizations or licenses or become subject to conditions that could make future operations more costly and impairing our profitability 

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

our clearing house seeks to offer customers intermediaries and clearing firms universal access in order to maximize the efficient use of capital exercise appropriate oversight of value at risk and maintain operating leverage from clearing activities our strategic business plan is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business some of our clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions of futures or options on futures from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our revenues and profits could be adversely affected 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business while we have implemented significant physical security protection measures   business continuity plans and established backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such attack may result in the closure of our trading and clearing facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to our business 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

maintaining our reputation and brand is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our business prospects these issues may include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a including risks from trading disputes system failures or intrusions failures to meet our regulatory obligations failures of a clearing firm issues relating to our third party suppliers misconduct and ineffective risk management 

the success of our markets depends on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers in 2017 89 of our overall volume was generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform 

 17 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform and other technology offerings to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading systems and technology offerings if we are unable to develop them to include other products and markets or if they do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed desired by our customers our ability to successfully compete and our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

our business is highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor on a daily basis a large number of transactions which occur at high volume and frequencies across multiple systems we are heavily reliant on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations our systems or those of our thirdparty providers including cloud providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error on our part or on the part of our vendors natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyber attacks acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems or the systems of our thirdparty providers do not operate properly are compromised or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platforms and technology offerings or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 18 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak contract volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in contract volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future contract volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual contract volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex contract volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and as we execute our business strategy although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

we as well as many of our customers depend on thirdparty suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors cloud hosting providers data center providers and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased contract volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of our clearing firms and consequently a diminishment in their financial resources could adversely affect us 

our clearing house operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles we routinely guarantee transactions submitted by our clearing firms with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one or more of our clearing firms 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to the clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a fund currently 98 million to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to qualified family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances if their clearing firm member becomes insolvent 

the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market 

to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit collateral to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and select etfs foreign sovereign debt canadian provincials and corporate bonds and subject them to established haircuts based on the type of collateral and maturity there is no guarantee the collateral will maintain its value to 

 19 

the extent a clearing firm is not compliant with capital margin or guaranty fund requirements it would be required to promptly come into compliance by adding capital or collateral decreasing its proprietary trading activity andor transferring customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products 

intellectual property rights licensed from thirdparty price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue regulatory scrutiny into such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products 

we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from thirdparty price reporting agencies to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily subject to manipulation our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenues 

our market data revenues may be reduced by decreased demand poor overall economic conditions or a significant change in how market participants trade and use market data 

we sell our market data to individuals trading institutions and other organizations that use our information services to participate in our markets andor monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data and information services represented 11  of our total revenues during both years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  a decrease in overall contract volume may lead to a decreased demand for our market data for example in both 2017  and 2016  we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data devices due to continued economic uncertainty high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms and the continued impact of legacy incentive programs tied to trading terminals 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter markets and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances our growth strategy also may subject us to increased legal compliance and regulatory obligations unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions other investments and strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of historical merger and acquisition activity in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us which could impact our ability to identify growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration also may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from our growth initiatives and investments which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we also may be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively affect our stock price 

 20 

expansion of our global operations involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our global operations we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in marketing our products and services in international markets we also may experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

the ultimate impact of brexit on the relevant law and scope of regulation applicable to our uk operations and to our european expansion is unclear and is contingent upon the terms of withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the united kingdom and the european union brexit may result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the withdrawal process progresses this could increase legal compliance and operational costs 

our compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators raised during regulatory examinations or we may otherwise become subject to their inquiry and oversight the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business in 2013 the cftc filed suit against nymex and two former employees alleging disclosure of confidential customer information in violation of the commodity exchange act based on our review of the allegations we believe that we have strong factual and legal defenses to the claim 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in the past misconduct by our employees and agents could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other 

 21 

countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example one of our former employees pled guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we might still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 22 billion  of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 23 billion  

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our us exchanges and clearing house also are required to maintain capital as defined by the cftc 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the past we have experienced ratings downgrades our failure to maintain our ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital additionally if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of our fixedrate notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest

our operations of and investments in businesses outside of the united states subject us to currency risk 

as a global company with operations outside of the united states portions of our revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the particular subsidiary because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability would be adversely affected 

twelve of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with the cme members rights to elect six directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

twelve of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members in 2017  83  of our contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result members may not have the same economic interests as holders of our class a common stock in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their methods of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry for options products still meeting certain volume thresholds and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

class b common stock 

our class b common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized overthecounter market each class of our class b common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our cme exchange cmes rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights each share of our class b common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights 

class b shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold or leased through our membership department although our class b shareholders have special voting rights because our class b shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our class a shares we expect that the market price of our class b common stock if reported separately from the associated trading rights would be primarily determined by the value of our class a common stock   as of february 7 2018 there were approximately 1590  holders of record of our class b common stock 

dividends 

the following table sets forth the dividends we declared on our class a and class b common stock in the last two years 



we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders according to our annual dividend policy which is set at between 50 and 60 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to declare a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our future earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant on february 7 2018  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 070  per share the dividend will be payable on march 26 2018  to shareholders of record on march 9 2018  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the total first quarter dividend payment will be approximately 2370 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 350 per share on december 6 2017 paid on january 16 2018 to the shareholders of record on december 28 2017 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined at the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results capitalization expenditures potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 364day clearing house credit facility for 70 billion and our 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

for example under our senior credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of september 30 2017 after giving effect to actual share repurchases made and special dividends paid including annual variable dividends but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid after september 30 2017 and in no event greater than 20 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends during the term of the agreement multiplied by 065 in addition our 364day clearing house credit facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 8000 million 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries including cme in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

cme group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of their state of incorporation which could also limit its or their ability to declare and pay dividends

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is organized as follows 

 references in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to cme group inc cme group and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively references to “exchange” are to chicago mercantile exchange inc cme the board of trade of the city of chicago inc cbot new york mercantile exchange inc nymex commodity exchange inc comex collectively unless otherwise noted 

executive summary 

business overview 

cme group a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for cme cbot nymex comex and their respective subsidiaries the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme groups class a common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol cme 

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts we also clear futures options on futures and swaps contracts through our clearing house futures contracts options on futures contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial derivatives institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals we also clear interest rate swaps and credit default swaps contracts in september 2017 we announced we will exit the credit default swaps business by mid2018 

our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platform this execution facility offers our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house 

our clearing house clears settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges in addition to cleared swaps products our clearing houses performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies 

in addition cme serves as a swap execution facility which is a regulated platform for swap trading and serves as a swap data repository which provides public data on swap transactions and stores confidential swap data for regulatory purposes

business trends 

economic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite economic uncertainty and volatility trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the united states and european credit crises fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the federal reserve bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment  our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry competition is influenced by our brand and reputation the efficiency and security of our services depth and liquidity of our markets breadth of product offerings including rate and quality of new product development and innovative services our ability to position and expand upon existing products efficient and seamless customer experience transparency reliability and anonymity of transaction processing the regulatory environment efficient and innovative technology and connectivity as well as transaction costs we believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges clearing organizations swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as markets continue to evolve we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers 

regulatory environment  exchangetraded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation as a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over the last several years various domestic and foreign governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have passed laws and regulations that apply to our business compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability 

our us futures exchanges and our clearing house are subject to extensive regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission cftc which carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act the commodity futures modernization act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank we believe that the regulations provide opportunities for our business our us clearing house has been designated by the cftc as a systemically important derivatives clearing organization which imposes various procedural and substantive requirements our us swap data repository service swap execution facility is also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the provisions of doddfrank and any new regulations in february 2017 president trump signed an executive order calling for the current us presidential administration to review us financial laws and regulations to determine their consistency with a set of core principles identified in the order some areas identified as subject to potential change amendment or repeal include the doddfrank act and the authorities of the federal reserve and the financial stability oversight council we cannot predict which if any of these or other actions will be taken or if taken their effect on our business 

as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign locations where we do business the financial services industry in europe has recently undergone regulatory reform and a reorganization of its regulatory framework our european operations are overseen by several regulators including the european securities market authority esma and the financial conduct authority fca in june 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which voters decided in favor of withdrawal from the european union the ultimate impact of this referendum in regards to the laws and regulations applicable to our european operations remains unclear and is contingent on the terms of the withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the united kingdom and the european union we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the new regulations in europe as well as the effects of this referendum 

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on building upon our benchmark products globalizing our company expanding our customer base extending our risk management and post trade offerings and establishing ourselves as the leading exchange company provider of information products and index services as well as enhancing our intellectual property portfolio we focus specifically on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services this strategy allows us to continue to 

 30 

develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes our strategic initiatives are discussed in item 1 business on page 5 

revenues 

clearing and transaction fees  a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for exchangetraded and cleared swaps contracts because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue 

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts fee limits and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

product mix we offer exchangetraded futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearedonly interest rate and credit default swap contracts rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products 

venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions privately negotiated transactions include block trades which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on cme globex or the trading floor privately negotiated transactions also include volume submitted through cme clearport and exchange for related positions efrps 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services access and communication fees and other various services related to our exchange operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third party distributors 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotations trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

 31 

access and communication fees access and communication fees are charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services our communication services include our colocation program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers 

other revenues other revenues include fees for collateral management and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms 

expenses 

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume however licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity energy and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices 

professional fees and outside services  this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives regulatory and other compliance matters temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements furniture fixtures and equipment this expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

other expenses we incur amortization of intangible assets and additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 



 32 

 nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include noncore investing and financing activities 

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value 

 for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant 

 33 

assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives 

revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests 

income taxes  calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs  certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally two to four years amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use we also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained in the cloud the costs associated with these cloudbased hosting arrangements do not qualify for capitalization and are expensed as incurred

financial highlights 

the following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented 



  

nm not meaningful 

revenues 



clearing and transaction fees 

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract for futures and options total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing houses and certain clearedonly contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures exclude credit default swaps and interest rate swaps 



we estimate the following increases decreases in clearing and transaction fees based on changes in total contract volume and changes in average rate per contract during 2017  compared with 2016  and during 2016  compared with 2015  



 35 

average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure including volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation 

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume contract volume can be influenced by many factors including political and economic factors the regulatory environment and market competition 



overall contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 interest rate volatility remained high in 2017 as the markets continued to experience uncertainty surrounding the federal reserves interest rate policy in december the federal open markets committee raised the federal funds rate for the third time in 2017 and also raised the expectation for additional rate increases in 2018 the equity markets experienced lower volatility in 2017 due to fewer marketmoving geopolitical events which resulted in lower equity contract volume crude oil volumes continued to grow throughout 2017 as crude oil market volatility remained high which contributed to an increase in energy contract volume there was a shift in crude oil supplies caused by an increase in united states crude oil production following the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec decision to cut oil supplies in the fourth quarter of 2016 

in 2016 when compared with 2015 overall contract volume remained high throughout 2016 due to periods of high volatility throughout 2016 we believe that global market concerns considerable uncertainty regarding the federal reserves interest rate policy and the anticipation of the united kingdoms european union membership referendum contributed to considerable volatility in the second half of 2016 volume across most of our products lines spiked as the us presidential and congressional elections injected considerable uncertainty into the markets the crude oil markets continued to show considerable uncertainty in early 2016 regarding the direction of future oil prices as global supplies continued to remain high which resulted in an increase in energy contract volume 

 36 

interest rate products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years   

overall interest rate contract volume from 2015 to 2017 increased due to volatility caused by continued uncertainty surrounding the federal reserves interest rate policy including volatility resulting from the federal open markets committee raising the federal funds rate three times during 2017 the increase in shortterm interest rate contract volume was also due to the uncertainty surrounding other global events including the 2017 elections throughout europe and the us presidential and congressional elections in the fourth quarter of 2016 in addition we believe the increase in longterm interest rate contract volume was due to the volatility resulting from the uncertainty surrounding the policies of the political administration in the united states concern regarding future rates of inflation and potential for changes in fiscal policy 

equity products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity products 



the decrease in overall equity contract volume in 2017 when compared with 2016 resulted from periods of lower equity market volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index the comparatively low volatility is believed to be caused by fewer marketmoving geopolitical and macrolevel events that impacted these indexes in 2017 during 2016 there were periods of higher volatility within the equity markets due to uncertainty regarding whether the federal open markets committee would begin to raise the federal funds rate in 2016 the deceleration of the chinese economy the results of the us presidential and congressional elections and declining global crude oil prices 

overall equity contract volume increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 as the equity markets experienced periods of higher volatility due to the continued ambiguity surrounding the federal reserves interest rate policy uncertainty surrounding the united kingdoms european union membership referendum and declining global crude oil prices the results of the us presidential and congressional elections injected new uncertainty into the markets in the fourth quarter of 2016 which we believe led to additional volatility 

 37 

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products 



foreign exchange contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 primarily due to higher euro contract volume due to uncertainty surrounding the european central bank policy we believe the japanese yen contract volume increased as market participants turned to the yen as a safehaven currency as currency rates steadied 

in 2016 when compared with 2015 the overall foreign exchange contract volume remained relatively flat the decline in euro contract volume resulted from low volatility which we believe was due to a lack of global macroeconomic drivers meaningfully affecting the euro in 2016 the decline in euro contract volume was partially offset by an increase in british pound contract volume which we believe was caused by volatility resulting from the uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom european union membership referendum in mid2016 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products 



agricultural commodity contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 largely due to higher corn and wheat volumes resulting from greater uncertainty related to weather conditions in 2017 the increase was partially offset by lower soybean volume due to lower uncertainty related to crop production versus 2016 

in 2016 when compared with 2015 agricultural commodity contract volume increased due to higher price volatility in the first half of 2016 which we believe was caused by greater uncertainty related to weather conditions and crop production for the 2016 growing season 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products 



in 2017 when compared with 2016 overall energy contract volume increased largely due to an increase in crude oil contract volume caused by higher volatility in 2017 we believe the increased volatility was caused by a shift in crude oil supplies as united states crude oil production rose along with the organization of petroleum exporting countries decision to cut oil supplies in the fourth quarter of 2016 natural gas and refined products contract volumes also increased in 2017 due to higher price volatility caused by shifts in supply and demand in the underlying markets 

overall energy contract volume increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 largely due to an increase in wti crude oil trading which we believe resulted from continued price volatility caused by excess global crude oil supplies and the marketplaces increased weighting of wti pricing as a global benchmark price for crude oil

metal products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products 



the overall increase in metal contract volume from 2015 to 2017 was due to investors using gold and other precious metals as safehaven alternative investments to other markets the increase in metal contract volume was driven by consistent periods of high price volatility caused by the uncertainties surrounding the policies of the political administration in the united states and future rates of inflation 

average rate per contract 

the average rate per contract decreased in 2017 when compared with 2016 as interest rate energy and metal contract volumes collectively increased by 3 percentage points as a percentage of total volume while agricultural commodity and equity contract volumes collectively decreased by 3 percentage points agricultural commodity and equity contracts have a higher average rate per contract compared with interest rate contracts the overall decreases in average rates per contract were partially offset by a rate increase that was effective in the first quarter of 2017 

in 2016 when compared with 2015 the average rate per contract decreased due to an increase in trades executed by members as a percentage of total trading volume as well as higher volumebased incentives this decrease was partially offset by the impact from a rate increase in early 2016 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13  and another firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2017 one firm represented 13  and another firm represented 11 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2016  and one firm represented 13  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2015  should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm 

other sources of revenue 

market data and information services beginning in 2016 the partial fee waivers that existed in 2015 ended contributing to an increase in market data and information services revenue in 2016 when compared with 2015 the increase was partially offset in 2016 and fully offset in 2017 due to declines in screen counts from costcutting initiatives at member firms and some rationalization as customer firms transitioned into fullpriced offerings 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented in aggregate 45  40  and 43  of our market data and information services revenue in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us

nonoperating income expense 



  

nm not meaningful 

 41 

investment income the increase in investment income from 2015 to 2017 was largely due to an increase in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that are reinvested which resulted primarily from higher average reinvestment balances and higher rates of interest earned in the cash account at the federal reserve bank of chicago in addition the increase in investment income from 2015 to 2017 was also due to higher net gains on sales of investments in 2017 we sold our remaining ownership interest in bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa and recognized a gain of 865 million  net of transaction costs we also sold our 2 interest in bolsa mexicana de valores sab de cv and recognized a gain of 23 million  net of transaction costs in 2016 we recognized a net gain of 484 million on sales of 280 million shares of our investment in bmfbovespa compared with a net loss of 85 million on sales of 410 million shares of bmfbovespa in 2015 the increases in investment income were partially offset by decreases in dividend income from 2015 to 2017 

interest and other borrowing costs interest and other borrowing costs were higher in 2016 when compared with 2015 and 2017 due to an increase in line of credit commitment fees in 2016 

equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries higher income generated from our spdji business venture contributed to increases in equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries from 2015 through 2017 

other income expense from 2015 to 2017 we recognized higher expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms these expenses are included in other nonoperating income expense 

in april 2015 we repurchased the 6125 million 440 notes due 2018 and paid a call premium of 605 million as a result of the transaction we recognized debt prepayment costs of 618 million including the call premium as other nonoperating income expense in the first quarter of 2015 we received a termination fee of 225 million net of the portion paid to outside advisers related to our proposed acquisition of gfi group which also was classified as other nonoperating income expense 

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 



 

nm not meaningful 

the overall decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 when compared with 2016 was primarily due to the remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recent us income tax reform the decrease was partially offset by expense from a state and local tax law change recorded in the third quarter of 2017 as well as from reclassifying income tax expense from other comprehensive income for the sale of the remaining bmfbovespa shares in the first quarter of 2017 

the overall decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 when compared with 2015 was due to an implementation of strategies to realize additional income tax benefits from the investment in bmfbovespa stock the overall decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by additional tax expense recognized from the remeasurement of tax positions resulting from a state and local income tax law change in the second quarter of 2016 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

we have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations while our cost structure is fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments however it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities 

 42 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2017  these were as follows 

  

 operating leases include rent payments for office space in chicago new york and other smaller offices in the united states and in various foreign countries the operating lease for our headquarters in chicago expires in 2032 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 125 million  to 197 million  we also maintain operating leases for additional office spaces and datacenter spaces in chicago which expire in november 2023 april 2027 and march 2031 annual minimum rental payments under these leases range from 57 million  to 62 million   34 million  to  43 million  and 168 million to 183 million respectively the operating lease for our office space in new york expires in december 2028 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 131 million to 145 million 

purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to advertising licensing hardware software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services debt obligations include repayment of principal and interest associated with the debt obligations other longterm liabilities include funding obligations for other postretirement benefit plans 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity performance improvements as well as improvements to some of our office spaces each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data centers telecommunications network and other operating equipment in 2018  we expect capital expenditures to total approximately 900 million to 1000 million we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders which is set at between 50 to 60 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant cme group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends on february 7 2018  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 070  per share the dividend will be payable on march 26 2018  to shareholders of record on march 9 2018  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately 2370 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 350 per share on december 6 2017 paid on january 16 2018 to the shareholders of record on december 28 2017 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results capitalization expenditures potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year

sources and uses of cash 

the following is a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 

  

nm not meaningful 

operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 when compared with 2016 was largely attributable to higher investment income related to our reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranty fund collateral net of the distribution of interest earned to the clearing firms as well as an increase in trading volumes and the reduction of restricted cash related to the cme clearing europe limited cmece guaranty fund 

the increase in 2016 when compared with 2015 was attributable to higher clearing and transaction fees and market data revenue 

investing activities 

the increases in cash provided by investing activities from 2015 through 2017 were due to proceeds from the sale of bmfbovespa shares as well as declines in purchases of property and equipment the increase in 2017 when compared with 2016 was also attributable to the sale of the remaining bolsa mexicana de valores sab de cv shares 

financing activities 

the increases in cash used by financing activities from 2015 through 2017 were attributable to higher cash dividends declared in 2017 and 2016 the increase in 2016 was partially offset by proceeds from a finance lease obligation related to the sale leaseback of the datacenter in the first quarter of 2016 

debt instruments 

the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2017  

  

  

 we maintain a 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions which matures in november 2022 the proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at cme groups discretion and if necessary for maturities of commercial paper as long as we are not in default under this facility we have the option to increase it up to 30 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds this facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty under this facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test which is defined as our consolidated shareholders equity at september 30 2017 giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid 

 44 

during the term of the agreements and in no event greater than 20 billion in aggregate multiplied by 065 we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility 

we maintain a 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing the facility provides for borrowings of up to 70 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian for our collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or us treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility at december 31 2017  guaranty funds available to collateralize the facility totaled 78 billion we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion our 364day facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as cme consolidated shareholders equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 8000 million we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility and our 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility for 70 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

in march 2016 we sold our datacenter in the chicago area for 1300 million at the time of the sale we leased back a portion of the property under generally accepted accounting principles the transaction has been accounted for under the financing method instead of a sale leaseback arrangement because our participation in future revenues and development work constitute continuing involvement in the datacenter under the financing method the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds of 1300 million from the transaction are recognized as a finance lease obligation within other liabilities and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet a portion of the lease payments will be recognized as a reduction of the finance lease obligation and a portion will be recognized as interest expense based on an imputed interest rate 

at december 31 2017  we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 23 billion under our multicurrency revolving senior credit facilities 

at december 31 2017  we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

to satisfy our performance bond obligation with singapore exchange limited we may pledge cmeowned us treasury securities or us dollars in lieu of or in combination with irrevocable letters of credit at december 31 2017  we had pledged letters of credit totaling 2850 million  

the following table summarizes our credit ratings as of december 31 2017  



given our cash flow generation our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities if necessary we expect to maintain an investment grade rating if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2017  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined by securities and exchange commission rules and regulations 

liquidity and cash management 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 19 billion  at both december 31 2017  and 2016  the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices a majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in us treasury securities us government agency securities and us treasury security reverse repurchase agreements our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments cash that is not available 

 45 

for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that no contribution will be necessary in 2018  as we have exceeded our funding goal by 741 million  in 2017 however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on various factors including the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2018  and the december 31 2018  discount rate 

regulatory requirements 

cme is regulated by the cftc as us derivatives clearing organizations dco dcos are required to maintain capital as defined by the cftc in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash liquid securities or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses cme was designated by the financial stability oversight council as a systemically important dco under title viii of doddfrank as a result cme must comply with the requirements for financial resources and liquidity resources cme is in compliance with all dco financial requirements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2017  consisted of fixedrate borrowings of 22 billion  changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixedrate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows we did not have any variablerate borrowings at december 31 2017  

credit risk 

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through third party exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for exchangetraded and swaps products including interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for clearing firms we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk we establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity we marktomarket open positions of clearing firms at least once a day twice a day for futures and options contracts and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value we have the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant these practices allow our clearing house to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity 

despite our safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

 46 

we maintain three separate financial safeguard packages 

 in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for clearing membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit 

we maintain a 70 billion 364day multicurrency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or us treasury securities performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day multicurrency line of credit we also have the option to use our 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default 

at december 31 2017 aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for all three financial safeguard packages was 1309 billion  including 418 billion  of cash performance bond deposits and 23 billion  of letters of credit a defaulting firms performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm 

the following shows the available assets at december 31 2017  in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on british pound cash balances held at subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result when subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency hold cash as well as certain other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies during 2017 the exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar fluctuated from a high of 136 per pound to a low of 120 per pound aggregate transaction gains losses for 2017  2016  and 2015  were 94 million 245 million and 113 million respectively we expect the foreign currency gainloss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold cash as well as certain assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets and liabilities we report in our consolidated balance sheets the financial statements of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in various currencies and are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income aggregate translation gains losses net of tax for 2017  2016  and 2015  were 75 million  69 million  and 66 million  respectively 

 48 

foreign currency exchange risk related to customer collateral 

a portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in foreign currency we marktomarket all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price therefore our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results

our strategic initiatives 

the following is a description of our strategic initiatives 

leading core business innovation and expanded product offerings —  we continue to focus on crossselling our products expanding the strength of our existing benchmark products launching new products and services and deepening open interest in our core futures and options on futures offerings during this decade our key product launches included ultralong bond treasury futures and options and most recently the ultra 10 year treasury futures weekly options for treasuries the sp 500 and various fx products numerous eurodollar midcurve options weekly and shortdated agricultural options end of month equity options wednesday weekly options deliverable interest rate swap futures interest rate swaptions new base metal products sp dividend futures emini russell 1000 futures and cme bloomberg spot dollar spot index futures during 2016 we experienced multiple volume records across our core product portfolio including record average daily volume in options electronic options and overall annual volume during the year we also achieved five of the top ten daily volume totals in our history we remain focused on expanding our sales and marketing capabilities and tools to broaden customer participation and to simplify and enrich the customer experience resulting in increased trading and a reduction in their regulatory burdens additionally through cme ventures we have made minority investments in emerging technology companies whose innovative products or services could in the long term have an impact on cme groups key business drivers and the broader financial services ecosystem 

globalizing our company and our business —  we continue to expand and diversify our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world the most broadly diversified portfolio of benchmark products we have expanded our international product suite with the launch of a number of regionally specific products including european wheat and aluminum futures which help us appeal to risk management needs unique to a particular geography we believe we have significant opportunity to expand the participation of our nonus customer base in our markets we are focused on core growth in global markets because we believe that asia latin america and other emerging markets will experience superior growth and development of their financial markets as they catch up to the more mature north american and european markets in addition we continue to expand our presence in major global financial centers grow our business outside the united states and penetrate emerging markets such as china india brazil and mexico in 2016 approximately 24 of our electronic volume was transactions

customers reported to us as from outside the united states and 50 of our market data revenue is derived from outside the united states 

in order to accelerate our longterm integration in the global economy cme group has built out its international infrastructure and strategic relationships in recent years we have expanded our ability to support physical delivery of locally relevant products in both europe and asia 

expanding our customer base and enhancing customer participation in our markets — we continue to grow our business by targeting cross asset sales across client segments driving international sales and generating new client participation across all regions we have a long history of providing customer value and responsiveness and believe our products and services make us well positioned to help our customers adapt and comply with new regulations while enabling them to efficiently manage their risks we have a broad distribution network comprised of a combination of internal and external channels and frontend capabilities with changing regulatory capital requirements for many of our customers and the need for greater efficiencies we have added tools to enable customers to build and manage trading and clearing positions in our markets in an efficient manner 

our customercentric approach to sales and distribution has resulted in greater customer participation over the past several years including a gradual increase in the number of firms holding large exposures in futures since the otc clearing mandates began in 2013 

with the ongoing implementation of regulatory reform in the united states and in europe we expect capital efficiencies and centralized clearing to continue to be important for our global client base 

extending our risk management and post trade offerings and solutions —  we provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the market for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing houses with clearing houses in both the united states and europe we can offer customers the choice of clearing in either location our clearing services also offer the ability to optimize collateral and capital efficiencies across their portfolios within the particular clearing house while meeting the heightened regulatory requirements on derivatives we offer clearing services for interest rate credit default foreign exchange and commodity swaps

patents trademarks and licenses 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we also own the copyright to a variety of materials those copyrights some of which are registered include printed and online publications websites advertisements educational material graphic presentations and other literature both textual and electronic we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks patents copyrights database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods 

we offer equity index futures and options on key benchmarks including sp nasdaq dow jones nikkei and the ftse russell indexes these products are listed by us subject to license agreements with the applicable owners of the indexes some of which are exclusive in connection with our joint venture with sp global inc we entered into a new license agreement sp license agreement which superseded our prior licensing arrangements and was assigned to the joint venture cme’s 

 8 

license for the sp 500 index will be exclusive for futures and options on futures until one year prior to the termination of the sp license agreement and nonexclusive for the last year the license for the other sp stock indexes is generally exclusive for futures and options on futures the term of the sp license agreement will continue until the later of i december 31 2017 or ii the date that is one year after the date that cme group ceases to own at least five percent accounting for dilution of the outstanding joint venture interests upon the occurrence of certain events including certain terminations of the joint venture the term may be extended up to an additional ten years cbot has an exclusive license agreement dow jones license agreement with cme group index services llc cme indexes for certain dow jones indexes which has also been assigned to the joint venture the initial term of the agreement is through june 30 2026 following the initial term the dow jones license agreement shall automatically renew for renewal terms of five years thereafter so long as there is open interest in any of cbot’s or its affiliates’ products based on one or more of the dow jones licensed indexes in the event there is no open interest in any such products then cme indexes has the ability to terminate the agreement we also have an exclusive license agreement for certain nasdaq indexes through 2019 copies of our sp dow jones and nasdaq license arrangements have been filed as material contracts we pay the applicable third party per trade fees based on contract volume under the terms of these licensing agreements 

we also have a longterm nonexclusive licensing arrangement with ice benchmark administration for the use of libor to settle several of our interest rate products including our eurodollar contract in august 2015 we entered into an exclusive license agreement with ftse russell 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with sp dow jones nasdaq and ftse russell or be able to maintain our other existing licensing arrangements beyond the term of the current agreements in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments including securities and options based on the sp dow jones or nasdaq indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties also may succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond our jurisdictional reach andor our licensors 

working capital 

we generally meet our funding requirements with internally generated funds supplemented from time to time with public debt and commercial paper offerings for more information on our working capital needs see “managements discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition—liquidity and capital resources” beginning on page 44 which section is incorporated herein by reference 

customer base 

our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers governments and central banks our customers can connect to our cme globex electronic trading platform from access points across the globe customers may be members of one or more of our cme cbot nymex or comex exchanges rights to directly access our markets will depend upon the nature of the customer such as whether the individual is a member of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access 

us trading rights and privileges are exchangespecific open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members membership on one of our us futures exchanges also enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees under the terms of the organizational documents of our us exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections in 2016  82  of our contract volume was conducted by our members 

the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represents charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13  and another firm represented 11  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2016  in the event a clearing firm were to withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange 

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank european market infrastructure regulation emir markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii capital requirements directive iv crd iv market abuse directive basel iii and various other laws and regulations 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 14 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties 

 9 

competition in our derivatives business 

we believe competition in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from others in the industry we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality maintain liquidity and low transaction costs and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers 

we compete in a large financial services trading clearing and settlement marketplace globally our competitors include among other entities exchanges such as intercontinental exchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited and deutsche börse ag competition in our industry continues to be dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business for example the development of swap execution facilities and the mandated trading andor clearing requirement for certain cleared swaps and privately negotiated products may lead to the creation of platforms that promote competitive substitutes for our exchangetraded and privately negotiated products 

additionally we face competition from substitute offerings these substitutes can take the form of swaps contracts identical or similar to our listed futures contracts or risksimilar products on spot and cash markets securities and securities options exchanges exchange traded funds and other instruments and other venues and mechanisms that can serve to offset economic risks 

competition in our transaction processing business 

in addition we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with compliance with doddfrank basel iii and other various laws and regulations 

our competitors in the clearing services space include among others companies such as ice lchclearnet ltd the options clearing corporation depository trust  clearing corporation and deutsche börse ag in light of the implementation of regulatory requirements and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing services 

we believe competition in transaction processing and business services is based on among other things the value of providing customers with capital and margin efficiencies quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house timely delivery of the services reputation offering breadth confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the fees charged for the services provided 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products 

 10 

although we may receive license fees for such products such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable product 

regulatory matters 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom and the european union we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges and other businesses to offer our products and services to their citizens 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 14 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties 

regulation in the united states 

our operation of us futures exchanges and our clearing houses is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc that requires that our regulated subsidiaries satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing houses cme clearing europe registered with the cftc as a derivatives clearing organization in november 2016 the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures and swaps markets and clearing houses in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years following the enactment of doddfrank the cftc has moved from a principlesbased to a more prescriptive regulatory approach over most aspects of our trading and clearing operations 

over the past five years a number of regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain overthecounter derivatives swap reporting operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting product definitions the definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets swap execution facilities and swap data repositories we continue to believe the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we continue to explore 

in november 2016 the united states held elections which resulted in the republican presidential candidate donald trump being elected as the 45th president of the united states and the republican party maintaining control of both houses of the us congress at this time we cannot predict the effect the result of the election will have on current or pending us regulations relating to the financial services industry 

our us clearing house has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization these designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities by the federal reserve bank and the cftc 

our us swap data repository service and swap execution facility are also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc 

regulation in the united kingdom and the european union 

in the united kingdom our operations are subject to multiple regulators the bank of england the fca and esma cme clearing our us clearing house is subject to certain conditions and reporting obligations as a result of its recognition by esma in the european union we also are subject to several supervisory authorities for financial services including esma multiple directives and regulations such as mifid ii and changes to the markets in financial instruments regulation mifir the capital requirements regulations iv and the market abuse directive have been proposed and in certain circumstances implemented with provisions similar to those contained in doddfrank 

in june 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which uk voters voted in favor of withdrawal from the european union brexit the ultimate impact of brexit on the relevant law and scope of regulation applicable to our uk operations is unclear and is contingent upon the terms of withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the united kingdom and the european union 

key areas of focus 

we actively monitor and participate in the domestic and international rulemaking processes for our industry including providing government testimony commenting on proposed rulemakings and educating our regulators on potential impacts to the marketplace

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market economic and political conditions that are beyond our control and that could significantly reduce our contract volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially dependent on the contract volume in our markets our contract volume is directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however as evidenced by our past performance in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital the shifts in market trading patterns we experienced as a result of the financial disturbance of 2008 may or may not recur in the future and our business will be affected by future economic uncertainties which may result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom and the european union we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges to offer our products and services to their citizens 

due to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 the united states and numerous other governments have undertaken reviews of the legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of debating or enacting new laws and regulations that will impact our business moreover in the aftermath of the 2016 us presidential election the us government has indicated a goal of reforming many aspects of existing financial services regulation while certain of these changes may have a positive impact on our business some of these changes could adversely affect our business including areas of regulatory focus discussed under item 1 – business – regulatory matters beginning on page 11 compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources that could result in some participants leaving our markets or decreasing their trading activity which would negatively affect our profitability we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the 

 14 

extensive regulations that apply to our business to the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete   our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe portions of doddfrank and the corresponding regulations with respect to mandatory clearing and organized trading provide opportunities for our business however other reforms could negatively impact our business and our ability to compete effectively we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and in some cases operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large industry participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do 

our competitors may 

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our fees or loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

please see item 1 – business – competition beginning on page 9 for additional information on the competitive environment and its potential impact on our business 

our contract volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our contract volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution and clearing facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example in recent years some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies such as lowering the fees that they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity payments or rebates we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13  and another firm represented 11  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2016  should a clearing firm withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely 

 15 

transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange however there is the possibility we would lose a portion of the customer business additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our contract volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of contract volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected furthermore declines in contract volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of contract volume 

our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyberattack and other cyber security risks our technology our people and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to cyber security threats which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and contract volume and result in substantial liabilities we also could be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems andor investigate any alleged attack 

we regard the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our technology our people and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to targeted attacks unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism firewall or encryption failures and other security problems criminal groups political activist groups and nationstate actors have targeted the financial services industry and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyberattack and other information security threats we experience cyberattacks of varying degrees on a regular basis our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our technology systems and data or our customers’ data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the services we provide that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business while resulting in regulatory penalties or the imposition of burdensome obligations by regulators in addition as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs 

additionally our role as a leading derivatives marketplace and the operation of our cme globex electronic trading platform may place us at greater risk for misappropriation of our intellectual property and persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use or steal our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations in the past we have been the victim of trade secret theft by an employee 

as part of our global information security program we employ resources to monitor and protect our technology infrastructure and employees against such cyberattacks and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property assets however these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed which could result in system failures and delays loss of customers and lower contract volume and negatively affect our competitive advantage and result in substantial costs and liabilities 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential commodity and securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while we generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on the ability to bring private causes of actions in cases where we have not acted in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated andor direct actions brought by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction or that we failed to effectively fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities we may be subject to disputes regarding the quality of trade execution the settlement of trades or other matters relating to our services we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation to the extent we are found to have failed to fulfill our regulatory obligations we could could lose our authorizations or licenses or become subject to conditions that could make future operations more costly and impairing our profitability 

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions 

 16 

established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

our clearing houses seek to offer customers intermediaries and clearing firms universal access in order to maximize the efficient use of capital exercise appropriate oversight of value at risk and maintain operating leverage from clearing activities our strategic business plan is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business some of our clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions of futures or options on futures from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our revenues and profits could be adversely affected 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business while we have implemented significant physical security protection measures   business continuity plans and established backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such attack may result in the closure of our trading and clearing facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to our business 

damage to our reputation could damage our business 

maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators negative publicity regarding our company or actual alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our business prospects these issues may include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a including risks from trading disputes system failures or intrusions failures to meet our regulatory obligations third party suppliers misconduct and ineffective risk management 

the success of our markets depends on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers in 2016 88 of our overall volume was generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 



 17 

if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading systems if we are unable to develop them to include other products and markets or if they do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed desired by our customers our ability to successfully compete and our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or be shut down or due to capacity constraints may operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error on our part or on the part of our vendors natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses cyberattacks acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems do not operate properly are compromised or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak contract volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in contract volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future contract volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual contract volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex contract volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and as we execute our business strategy although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing 

 18 

volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

we as well as many of our customers depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased contract volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of our third party clearing firms and consequently a diminishment in their financial resources could adversely affect us 

our clearing house operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles we routinely guarantee transactions submitted by our clearing firms with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one or more of our clearing firms 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to the clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a fund currently up to 98 million to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to qualified family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances if their clearing firm member becomes insolvent 

the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market 

to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit collateral to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and foreign sovereign debt and subject them to established haircuts based on the type of collateral and maturity there is no guarantee the collateral will maintain its value to the extent a clearing firm is not compliant with capital margin or guaranty fund requirements it would be required to promptly come into compliance by adding capital or collateral decreasing its proprietary trading activity andor transferring customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products 

intellectual property rights licensed from third party price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue regulatory scrutiny into such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products 

we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from third party price reporting agencies to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily subject to manipulation our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenues 

our market data revenues may be reduced by decreased demand poor overall economic conditions or a significant change in how market participants trade and use market data 

we sell our market data to individuals trading institutions and other organizations that use our information services to participate in our markets andor monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data and information services represented 11  and 12 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively a 

 19 

decrease in overall contract volume may lead to a decreased demand for our market data for example in both 2016  and 2015  we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data devices due to continued economic uncertainty continued high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms and the continued impact of legacy incentive programs tied to trading terminals 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter markets and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances our growth strategy also may subject us to increased legal compliance and regulatory obligations unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions other investments and strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of recent merger and acquisition activity in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us which could impact our ability to identify growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration also may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from our growth initiatives and investments which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we also may be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively affect our stock price 

expansion of our global operations involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our global operations directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in marketing our products and services in international markets we also may experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

the ultimate impact of brexit on the relevant law and scope of regulation applicable to our uk operations and to our european expansion is unclear and is contingent upon the terms of withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the united 

 20 

kingdom and the european union brexit may result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the withdrawal process progresses this could increase legal compliance and operational costs 

our compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators raised during regulatory examinations or we may otherwise become subject to their inquiry and oversight the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business in 2013 the cftc filed suit against nymex and two former employees alleging disclosure of confidential customer information in violation of the commodity exchange act based on our review of the allegations we believe that we have strong factual and legal defenses to the claim 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in the past misconduct by our employees and agents could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example in the past a former employee of cme group pled guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

 21 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we might still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 22 billion  of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 23 billion  

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our us exchanges and clearing house also are required to maintain capital as defined by the cftc 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the past we have experienced ratings downgrades our failure to maintain our ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital additionally if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of our fixedrate notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

our operations of and investments in businesses outside of the united states subject us to currency risk 

since we conduct business outside of the united states primarily in the united kingdom portions of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars and pounds sterling because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

 22 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability would be adversely affected 

thirteen of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with the cme members rights to elect six directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

thirteen of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members in 2016  82  of our contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result members may not have the same economic interests as holders of our class a common stock in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their methods of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry for options products still meeting certain volume thresholds and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

our class a common stock is currently listed on nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” as of february 8 2017 there were approximately 2460  holders of record of our class a common stock 

the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of our class a common stock on a quarterly basis as reported on nasdaq 



class b common stock 

our class b common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized overthecounter market each class of our class b common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our cme exchange cmes rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights each share of our class b common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights 

class b shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold or leased through our membership department although our class b shareholders have special voting rights because our class b shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our class a shares we expect that the market price of our class b common stock if reported separately from the associated trading rights would be primarily determined by the value of our class a common stock   as of february 8 2017 there were approximately 1610  holders of record of our class b common stock 

dividends 

the following table sets forth the dividends we declared on our class a and class b common stock in the last two years 



we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders according to our annual dividend policy which is set at between 50 and 60 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to declare a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our future earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant on february 8 2017  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 066  per share the dividend will be payable on march 27 2017  to shareholders of record on march 10 2017  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the total first quarter dividend payment will be approximately 2230 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 325 per share on december 7 2016 paid on january 13 2017 to the shareholders of record on december 28 2016 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined at the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results capitalization expenditures potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 364day clearing house credit facility for 70 billion and our 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

 25 

for example under our senior credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2014 after giving effect to actual share repurchases made and special dividends paid including annual variable dividends but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid after december 31 2014 and in no event greater than 20 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends during the term of the agreement multiplied by 065 in addition our 364day clearing house credit facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 8000 million 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries including cme in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

cme group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of their state of incorporation which could also limit its or their ability to declare and pay dividends

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend introduction 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is organized as follows 

 references in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to cme group inc cme group and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively references to “exchange” are to chicago mercantile exchange inc cme the board of trade of the city of chicago inc cbot new york mercantile exchange inc nymex commodity exchange inc comex cme clearing europe limited cmece and cme europe limited cme europe collectively unless otherwise noted 

overview 

business overview 

cme group a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for cme cbot nymex comex and their respective subsidiaries as well as cmece and cme europe the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme groups class a common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” 

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts we also clear futures options on futures and swaps contracts through our two clearing houses cme clearing which is a division of cme and cmece futures contracts options on futures contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals we also clear interest rate swaps and credit default swaps contracts 

our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platform this execution facility offers our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing houses 

our clearing houses clear settle and guarantee futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges in addition to cleared swaps products our clearing houses performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing houses as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies 

in addition cme serves as a swap execution facility which is a regulated platform for swap trading and serves as a swap data repository which provides public data on swap transactions and stores confidential swap data for regulatory purposes

business trends 

economic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite economic uncertainty and volatility trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the united states and european credit crises fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management changes in the us presidential administration as well as the federal reserve bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment  our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry competition is influenced by our brand and reputation the efficiency and security of our services depth and liquidity of our markets breadth of product offerings including rate and quality of new product development our ability to position and expand upon existing products transparency reliability and anonymity of transaction processing the regulatory environment efficient and innovative technology and connectivity as well as transaction costs we believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges clearing organizations swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as markets continue to evolve we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers 

regulatory environment  exchangetraded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation as a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over the last several years various domestic and foreign governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have passed laws and regulations that apply to our business compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability 

our us futures exchanges and our clearing houses are subject to extensive regulation by the us commodity futures trading commission cftc which carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act the commodity futures modernization act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank over the last five years a number of regulations to implement doddfrank were finalized we believe that the regulations provide opportunities for our business our us clearing house has been designated by the cftc as a systemically important derivatives clearing organization which imposes various procedural and substantive requirements our us swap data repository service is also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the provisions of doddfrank and any new regulations in november 2016 the united states held elections which resulted in the republican presidential candidate donald trump being elected as the 45th president of the united states and the republican party maintaining control of both houses of the us congress at this time we cannot predict the effect the result of the election will have on current or pending us regulations relating to the financial services industry 

as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign locations where we do business the financial services industry in europe has recently undergone regulatory reform and a reorganization of its regulatory framework our european operations are now overseen by several regulators including the bank of england the financial conduct authority fca and the european securities market authority esma in june 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which voters decided in favor of withdrawal from the european union the ultimate impact of this referendum in regards to the laws and regulations applicable to our european operations remains unclear and is contingent on the terms of the withdrawal and the ongoing relationship between the united kingdom and the european union we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the new regulations in europe as well as the effects of this referendum 

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on leveraging our benchmark products enhancing our customer relations expanding our customer base advancing our clearing and trading technologies and deriving benefits from our integrated clearing houses as well as our scalable infrastructure we focus specifically on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes our strategic initiatives are discussed in item 1 business on page 7

revenues 

clearing and transaction fees  a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for exchangetraded and cleared swaps contracts because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue 

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts fee limits and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

product mix we offer exchangetraded futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearedonly interest rate and credit default swap contracts rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products 

venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions privately negotiated transactions include block trades which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on cme globex or the trading floor privately negotiated transactions also include volume submitted through cme clearport and exchange for related positions efrps 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services access and communication fees and other various services related to our exchange operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third party distributors 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotations trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

access and communication fees access and communication fees are charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services our communication services include our colocation program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers 

 31 

other revenues other revenues include fees for administrating our interest earning facility ief program we offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various ief offerings these clearing firms receive interest income and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit other revenues also include fees for collateral management and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms 

in addition other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by gfx corporation gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that trades futures contracts in a fully hedged book to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for certain products 

expenses 

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume however licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity energy and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to stock options restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices 

professional fees and outside services  this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives regulatory and other compliance matters temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements furniture fixtures and equipment this expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

other expenses we incur amortization of intangible assets and additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 



 32 

sharing on cleared swaps contracts and some new product launches this expense fluctuates with changes in contract volumes as well as changes in fee structures 

 nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include noncore investing and financing activities 

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value 

 for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 18 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given 

 33 

the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangibles assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment at least annually or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows only if there are indicators of a change in circumstances if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives 

revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing houses clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests 

income taxes  calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs  certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally three years amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new standard on revenue recognition that replaces numerous industryspecific requirements and converges us accounting standards with international financial reporting standards the new standard introduces a framework for recognizing revenue that focuses on the transfer of control rather than risks and rewards the new standard also requires significant additional disclosures about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract the application of the new standard becomes effective 

 34 

in the first annual period beginning after december 15 2017 with early adoption permitted this guidance may be adopted using one of two transition methods retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial adoption the modified retrospective approach we are on course to comply with the guidance by the effective date we are currently in the contract review phase which is expected to be completed by mid2017 we expect to reach a conclusion on whether there will be changes in revenue recognition which method of adoption will be used and the impact the guidance will have on policies process and controls towards the end of 2017 

in january 2016 the fasb issued a standards update that will change how entities measure certain equity investments it does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans under the new guidance entities will have to measure many equity investments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for a practicability exception entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available for sale in other comprehensive income the update is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued a standards update that requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities associated with the rights and obligations created by those leases the guidance for lessors is largely unchanged from current us gaap under the new guidance a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months consistent with current us gaap the recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease the update is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2016 the fasb issued a standards update that will change certain aspects of accounting for sharebased payments to employees the guidance will require all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled it will also allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee’s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur the update is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 we will implement this standards update in the first quarter of 2017 and update our disclosure according to the new requirements 

in june 2016 the fasb issued guidance that changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments the standard requires an entity to estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record an allowance that when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset this forwardlooking expected loss model generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses the standard also amends the impairment model for available for sale debt securities and requires entities to determine whether all or a portion of the unrealized loss on an available for sale debt security is a credit loss severity and duration of the unrealized loss are no longer permissible factors in concluding whether a credit loss exists entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses on available for sale debt securities immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time the standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2019 the standard’s provisions must be applied as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning in 2019 we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 

in november 2016 the fasb issued a standards update aimed at promoting consistency in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows previously there was diversity in practice as to whether the change in restricted cash was included in the reconciliation of beginningofperiod and endofperiod total cash amounts shown on the statement of cash flows the amendments require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents as well as amounts described as restricted cash on the balance sheet this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted the amendments must be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements

revenues 



clearing and transaction fees 

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract for futures and options total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing houses and certain clearedonly contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures exclude credit default swaps and interest rate swaps the credit default swaps and interest rate swaps are discussed in a later section 



we estimate the following increases decreases in clearing and transaction fees based on changes in total contract volume and changes in average rate per contract during 2016  compared with 2015  and during 2015  compared with 2014  



average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure including volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the 

 36 

relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation 

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume contract volume can be influenced by many factors including political and economic factors the regulatory environment and market competition 



overall contract volume remained high throughout 2016 due to periods of high volatility throughout early 2016 we believe that global market concerns considerable uncertainty regarding the federal reserves interest rate policy and the anticipation of the united kingdoms european union membership referendum contributed to considerable volatility in the second half of 2016 volume across most of our products lines spiked in the fourth quarter as the us presidential and congressional elections injected considerable uncertainty into the markets following the election there was a shift in expectations regarding future corporate income tax rates infrastructure spending national debt levels and inflation concerns the anticipation of the federal open market committee meetings in the fourth quarter of 2016 in which the federal funds rate was raised by 25 basis points contributed to further volatility in the second half of 2016 

crude oil volumes continued to grow throughout 2016 as crude oil market volatility remained high throughout the year the crude oil markets continued to show considerable uncertainty in early 2016 regarding the direction of future oil prices as global supplies continued to remain high which resulted in significant contract volume increases in the energy market in the fourth quarter of 2016 the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec decided to cut oil production which led to a sharp increase in oil prices 

overall futures and options contract volume increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by an increase in energy contract volume the fall in crude oil prices that began in the fourth quarter of 2014 continued through 2015 and resulted in several periods of high volatility throughout 2015 volatility was heavily influenced by the increase in global crude oil supplies which outpaced demand

overall interest rate contract volume increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 largely due to periods of high interest rate volatility throughout the year particularly within the first and fourth quarter of 2016 we believe the high volatility resulted from the continued uncertainty throughout early 2016 around changes to the federal reserves interest rate policy in the nearterm interest rate volatility also remained high throughout the fourth quarter of 2016 due to market uncertainty resulting from the us presidential and congressional elections in november and the increase in the federal funds rate following the federal open market committees meeting in december in addition electronic eurodollar options volumes increased in 2016 due to our continued investment in system enhancements and increased client adoption of electronic options trading 

in 2015 when compared with 2014 overall interest rate volumes decreased due to a decline in longerdated interest rate contract volume as market participants anticipated a potential change in interest rates in the near term in 2015 we believe these participants shifted their focus from back 32 eurodollar futures and longerdated us treasury futures and options to shorter term products including the 2year us treasury futures and options while interest rate volatility remained high in early 2015 changes in macroeconomic factors and a shift from the first quarters expectations regarding the federal reserve interest rate policy change lowered interest rate volatility throughout the remainder of 2015 

equity products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity products 



we believe the increase in overall equity contract volume in 2016 when compared with 2015 resulted from periods of high market volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index throughout 2016 during 2016 the equity markets experienced periods of higher volatility due to the continued ambiguity surrounding the federal reserves interest rate policy uncertainty surrounding the united kingdoms european union membership referendum and declining global crude oil prices the results of the us presidential and congressional elections injected new uncertainty into the markets in the fourth quarter of 2016 which we believe led to additional volatility 

overall equity contract volume remained flat in 2015 when compared with 2014 because volatility remained high in both periods global economic events led by a deceleration of the chinese economy in the second half of 2015 resulted in high market volatility in 2015 in 2014 high volatility resulted from geopolitical events in russia ukraine and the middle east 

the emini nasdaq contract volumes from 2014 through 2016 did not benefit from macrolevel events or increased general market volatility to the same extent as the emini sp 500 because the emini nasdaq contract generally hedges different market risks compared with the market risks hedged by the emini sp 500 contracts

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products 



in 2016 when compared with 2015 the overall foreign exchange contract volume remained relatively flat the decline in euro contract volume resulted from low volatility which we believe resulted from a lack of global macroeconomic drivers meaningfully affecting the euro in 2016 the decline in euro contract volume was partially offset by an increase in british pound contract volume which we believe was caused by volatility resulting from the uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom european union membership referendum in mid2016 

foreign exchange contract volume increased in 2015 when compared with 2014 primarily due to an increase in euro contract volume caused by quantitative easing and debt concerns in europe global economic uncertainty geopolitical events as well as a strengthening us dollar throughout 2015 we believe these factors led to increases in exchange rate volatility 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products 



in 2016 when compared with 2015 agricultural commodity contract volume increased due to higher price volatility in the first half of 2016 which we believe was caused by greater uncertainty related to weather conditions and crop production for the 2016 growing season 

agricultural commodity product volume increased in 2015 when compared with 2014 due to changes in weather patterns caused by el niño an increase in rainfall across the united states during 2015 resulted in concerns over planting delays which we believe led to an increase in volatility within the agricultural commodity markets 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products 



overall energy contract volume increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 largely due to an increase in wti crude oil trading which we believe resulted from continued price volatility caused by excess global crude oil supplies and the marketplaces increased weighting of wti pricing as a global benchmark price for crude oil we believe overall energy volume remained high throughout the fourth quarter of 2016 due to high volatility within the energy markets following the organization of petroleum exporting countries decision to cut oil supplies as well as the us presidential and congressional elections which created uncertainty surrounding the new administrations proposed policies for the energy markets 

overall energy contract volume increased in 2015 when compared with 2014 largely due to an increase in crude oil contract volume caused by higher volatility we believe the increase in crude oil volatility resulted from a continuing shift in crude oil 

 39 

supply that began in the fourth quarter of 2014 additionally refined products and natural gas contract volumes increased largely due to higher price volatility in the underlying markets 

metal products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products 



overall metal contract volume increased in 2016 when compared with 2015 due to investors using gold and other precious metals as a safehaven alternative investment to the volatile equity markets in 2016 during the fourth quarter of 2016 overall market volatility remained high following the us presidential and congressional election in november which resulted in higher metal contract volume in the fourth quarter of 2016 

metal contract volume remained flat in 2015 compared with 2014 we believe that demand was stagnant due to lower economic growth rates in asia which resulted in reduced volatility throughout 2014 and 2015 

average rate per contract 

the average rate per contract decreased in 2016 when compared with 2015 due to an increase in trades executed by members as a percentage of total trading volume as well as higher volumebased incentives this decrease was partially offset by the impact from a rate increase in early 2016 

in 2015 when compared with 2014 the average rate per contract increased due to a shift in relative mix of product volume energy and agricultural commodity contract volumes when measured as a percentage of total volume collectively increased by 3 percentage points in 2015 while interest rate contract volume decreased by 3 percentage points energy and agricultural commodity contracts have a higher average rate per contract compared with interest rates in addition price increases implemented in february 2015 resulted in a 2 increase in the average rate per contract in 2015 when compared with 2014 

clearedonly swap contracts 

clearing and transaction fees as presented on the consolidated statements of income include revenues for our clearedonly interest rate swap and credit default swap contracts in 2016 2015 and 2014 clearing and transaction fees generated from these contracts were 620 million 670 million and 595 million respectively the decrease in revenue in 2016 when compared with 2015 was largely attributable to a reduction in client activity after the first quarter of 2015 as we believe some customers chose alternative products and venues to manage risk the increase in revenue in 2015 compared with 2014 was largely attributable to increased sales efforts centered around customer education 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13  and another firm represented 11  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2016 one firm represented 13  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2015  and one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2014  should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm 

other sources of revenue 

market data and information services 

beginning in 2016 the partial fee waivers that existed in 2015 ended contributing to an increase in market data and information services revenue in 2016 when compared with 2015 the increase was partially offset by some rationalization as customer firms transitioned into fullpriced offerings as well as reductions in overall screen counts at member banks 

the increase in market data and information services revenue in 2015 when compared with 2014 was attributable to the reduction of fee waivers for certain existing customers beginning in 2015 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented in aggregate 40  43  and 44  of our market data and information services revenue in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the 

 40 

majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 

expenses 



2016 compared with 2015 

operating expenses increased by 544 million  in 2016 when compared with 2015 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the net increase in operating expenses 



increases in operating expenses in 2016 when compared with 2015 were as follows

overal l operating expenses decreased in 2015 when compared with 2014 due to the following reasons 

 the decrease in overall operating expenses in 2015 when compared with 2014 was partially offset by the following increases

nm not meaningful 

investment income the increase in investment income in 2016 when compared with 2015 was largely attributable to higher net gains on investments including a net gain of 484 million recognized on sales of 280 million shares of our investment in bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa in 2016 compared with a net loss of 85 million on sales of 410 million shares of bmfbovespa in 2015 the overall increase in investment income was also due to an increase in the rate of interest earned from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that are reinvested the increase in investment income was partially offset by a decrease in dividend income in 2016 

the overall decrease in investment income in 2015 when compared with 2014 was largely due to a net loss of 85 million on sales of bmfbovespa shares in 2015 this loss was partially offset by an increase in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions as a result of larger collateral balances held 

interest and other borrowing costs the overall increase in interest and other borrowing costs in 2016 when compared with 2015 was due to an increase in commitment fees the following table shows the weighted average borrowings outstanding weighted average effective yield and average cost of borrowing for the periods presented 



1 average cost of borrowings includes interest the effective portion of interest rate hedges discount accretion and debt issuance costs commitment fees on line of credit agreements are not included in the average cost of borrowings 

in february 2014 we repaid the 7500 million 575 notes due february 2014 in march 2015 we issued 7500 million 30 notes due march 2025 and in april 2015 we repurchased the 6125 million 440 notes due march 2018 these transactions contributed to a decrease in weighted average effective yield and average cost of borrowings in 2015 when compared with 2014 the weighted average borrowings outstanding was slightly higher in 2015 compared with 2016 and 2014 due to the timing of the replacement of the 6125 million 440 notes with the 7500 million 30 notes in early 2015 

equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries higher income generated from our spdji business venture contributed to increases in equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries from 2014 through 2016 

other income expense in 2016 when compared with 2015 we recognized higher expense related to the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms in april 2015 we repurchased the 6125 million 440 notes due 2018 and paid a call premium of 605 million as a result of the transaction we recognized debt prepayment costs of 618 million including the call premium as other nonoperating income expense in the first quarter of 2015 we received a termination fee of 225 million net of the portion paid to outside advisers related to our proposed acquisition of gfi group which also was classified as other nonoperating income expense

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 



the overall decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 when compared with 2015 was due to an implementation of strategies to realize additional income tax benefits from the investment in bmfbovespa stock the overall decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by additional tax expense recognized from the remeasurement of tax positions resulting from a state and local income tax law change in the second quarter of 2016 

the effective tax rate in 2015 was relatively flat compared with the effective tax rate in 2014 because the deferred income tax benefit resulting from remeasurement of the deferred income tax balances in 2015 related to changes in state and local apportionment factors and enacted state and local law changes was comparable to similar benefits arising from audit settlements and remeasurement of deferred income tax balances in 2014 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

we have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations while our cost structure is fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments however it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2016  these were as follows 

  

 operating leases include rent payments for office space in chicago new york and other smaller offices in the united states and in various foreign countries the operating lease for our headquarters in chicago expires in november 2022 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 122 million  to 135 million  we also maintain operating leases for additional office spaces and datacenter spaces in chicago which expire in november 2023 april 2027 and march 2031 annual minimum rental payments under these leases range from 56 million  to 62 million   33 million  to  43 million  and 167 million to 183 million respectively the operating lease for our office space in new york expires in december 2028 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 131 million to 145 million 

purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to advertising licensing hardware software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services debt obligations include repayment of principal and interest associated with the debt obligations other longterm liabilities include funding obligations for other postretirement benefit plans 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity performance improvements as well as improvements to some of our office spaces each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data centers telecommunications network and other operating equipment in 2017  we expect capital expenditures to total approximately 1050 million we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

 44 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders which is set at between 50 to 60 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant cme group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends on february 8 2017  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 066  per share the dividend will be payable on march 27 2017  to shareholders of record on march 10 2017  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately 2230 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 325 per share on december 7 2016 paid on january 13 2017 to the shareholders of record on december 28 2016 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results capitalization expenditures potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

sources and uses of cash 

the following is a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



nm not meaningful 

operating activities 

the increases in net cash provided by operating activities from 2014 through 2016 were largely attributable to higher clearing and transaction fees and market data revenues 

investing activities 

the increases in cash provided by investing activities from 2014 through 2016 were due to proceeds from the sale of bmfbovespa shares in 2016 and 2015 as well as declines in purchases of property and equipment the increase in 2015 when compared with 2014 was also due to additional investments in business ventures in 2014 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities in 2016 when compared with 2015 was attributable to higher cash dividends paid in 2016 the increase was partially offset by proceeds from a finance lease obligation related to the sale leaseback of the datacenter in the first quarter of 2016 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2015 when compared with 2014 was largely due to the proceeds received from the issuance of the 7500 million fixed rate notes in march 2015 

 45 

debt instruments 

the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2016  

  

 we maintain a 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions which matures in march 2020 the proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes which includes providing liquidity for our clearing houses in certain circumstances at cme groups discretion and if necessary for maturities of commercial paper as long as we are not in default under this facility we have the option to increase it up to 30 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds this facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty under this facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test which is defined as our consolidated shareholders equity at december 31 2014 giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements and in no event greater than 20 billion in aggregate multiplied by 065 we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility 

in march 2016 we sold our datacenter in the chicago area for 1300 million at the time of the sale we leased back a portion of the property under generally accepted accounting principles the transaction has been accounted for under the financing method instead of a sale leaseback arrangement because our participation in future revenues and development work constitute continuing involvement in the datacenter under the financing method the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds of 1300 million from the transaction are recognized as a finance lease obligation within other liabilities and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet a portion of the lease payments will be recognized as a reduction of the finance lease obligation and a portion will be recognized as interest expense based on an imputed interest rate 

we maintain a 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing the facility provides for borrowings of up to 70 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian for our collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms cme clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or us treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility at december 31 2016  guaranty funds available to collateralize the facility totaled 60 billion we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion our 364day facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as cme consolidated shareholders equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 8000 million we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility and our 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility for 70 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

at december 31 2016  we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 23 billion under our multicurrency revolving senior credit facilities 

at december 31 2016  we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

 46

the following table summarizes our credit ratings as of december 31 2016  



given our cash flow generation our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities if necessary we expect to maintain an investment grade rating if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2016  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined by securities and exchange commission rules and regulations 

liquidity and cash management 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 19 billion  at december 31 2016  and 17 billion  at december 31 2015  the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices a majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in us treasury securities us government agency securities and us treasury security reverse repurchase agreements our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that a 139 million  contribution in 2017  will allow us to meet our funding goal however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2017  and the december 31 2017  discount rate

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2016  consisted of fixedrate borrowings of 22 billion  changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixedrate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows we did not have any variablerate borrowings at december 31 2016  

credit risk 

our clearing houses act as the counterparties to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through third party exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of 

 47 

third parties including clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for exchangetraded and swaps products including interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for cme and cmece clearing firms we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk we establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity we marktomarket open positions of cme and cmece clearing firms at least once a day twice a day for futures and options contracts and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value we have the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant these practices allow our clearing houses to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing houses to ensure performance of their open positions 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity 

despite our safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

cme clearing 

we maintain three separate financial safeguard packages for cme clearing member firms 

 in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for clearing membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit 

we maintain a 70 billion 364day multicurrency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or us treasury securities performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day multicurrency line of credit we also have the option to use our 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing houses in the unlikely event of default 

at december 31 2016 aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for all three cme financial safeguard packages excluding the safeguard packages for cmece was 1496 billion  including 356 billion  of cash performance bond deposits and 23 billion  of letters of credit a defaulting firms performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm

cmece 

we maintain two separate financial safeguard packages for cmece clearing member firms 

 under the financial safeguard package for cmece commodity and foreign exchange clearing firms we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations in the unlikely event of default by a cmece clearing firm these assets include the defaulting firms performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions thereafter if the default remains unsatisfied after first applying assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation we would use guaranty fund contributions of 500 million  from cmece funds clearing firms contributions to the commodity and foreign exchange guaranty fund totaled 248 million  at december 31 2016  once clearing firms fully contribute to the guaranty fund we would use at least 200 million of cmece funds in addition to the clearing firms guaranty fund contributions in the event of a default of a commodity or foreign exchange clearing firm 

we also maintain a financial safeguard package for cmece interest rate swap clearing firms in the unlikely event of default by a cmece clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations these assets include the defaulting firms performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions if the default remains unsatisfied we would apply guaranty fund contributions of 398 million  that will be contributed by cmece the interest rate swap clearing firms contributions to the interest rate swap guaranty fund totaled 923 million  at december 31 2016  

aggregate cash performance bond deposits for cmece clearing firms for the commodity and foreign exchange clearing firms and interest rate swap clearing firms were 1563 million  at december 31 2016  there were no noncash performance bonds on deposit at december 31 2016  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on british pound cash balances held at subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result when subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency hold cash as well as certain other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies during 2016 the exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar fluctuated from a high of 148 per pound to a low of 122 per pound aggregate transaction losses for 2016  2015  and 2014  were 245 million 113 million and 154 million respectively we expect the foreign currency gainloss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold cash as well as certain assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets and liabilities we report in our consolidated balance sheets the financial statements of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in various currencies and are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income aggregate translation losses net of tax for 2016  2015  and 2014  were 69 million  66 million  and 31 million  respectively 

foreign currency risk related to equity investments 

we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain equity investments as discussed in the equity price risk section below 

foreign currency exchange risk related to customer collateral 

a portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in foreign currency we marktomarket all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price therefore our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results 

equity price risk

working capital 

we generally meet our funding requirements with internally generated funds supplemented from time to time with public debt and commercial paper offerings for more information on our working capital needs see “managements discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition—liquidity and capital resources” beginning on page 45 which section is incorporated herein by reference 

customer base 

our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers governments and central banks our customers can connect to our cme globex electronic trading platform from access points across the globe customers may be members of one or more of our cme cbot nymex or comex exchanges rights to directly access our markets will depend upon the nature of the customer such as whether the individual is a member of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access 

us trading rights and privileges are exchangespecific trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by our members membership on one of our us futures exchanges also enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees under the terms of the organizational documents of our us exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections in 2015  81  of our contract volume was conducted by our members 

 9 

the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represents charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2015  in the event a clearing firm were to withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange 

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank european market infrastructure regulation emir markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii capital requirements directive iv crd iv market abuse directive basel iii and various other laws and regulations 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 14 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties 

competition in our derivatives business 

we believe competition in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from others in the industry we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality maintain liquidity and low transaction costs and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers 

we compete in a large financial services trading clearing and settlement marketplace globally our competitors include among other entities exchanges such as intercontinental exchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited and deutsche börse ag competition in our industry continues to be dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business for example the development of swap execution facilities and the mandated trading andor clearing requirement for certain cleared swaps and privately negotiated products may lead to the creation of platforms that promote competitive substitutes for our exchangetraded and privately negotiated products 

additionally we face competition from substitute offerings these substitutes can take the form of swaps contracts identical or similar to our listed futures contracts or risksimilar products on spot and cash markets securities exchanges exchange traded funds and other instruments and other venues and mechanisms that can serve to offset economic risks 

competition in our transaction processing business 

in addition we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with the continued implementation of and compliance with doddfrank 

our competitors in the clearing services space include among others companies such as ice lchclearnet ltd the options clearing corporation depository trust  clearing corporation and deutsche börse ag in light of the implementation of 

 10 

doddfranks clearing mandate the european clearing mandate starting in 2016 and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing services 

we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the value of providing customers with capital efficiencies quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house timely delivery of the services reputation offering breadth confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the fees charged for the services provided 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products although we may receive license fees for such products such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable product 

regulatory matters 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom and the european union we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges and other businesses to offer our products and services to their citizens 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 14 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties 

regulation in the united states 

our operation of us futures exchanges and our us clearing house is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc that requires that our regulated subsidiaries satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures markets and clearing houses in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years following the enactment of doddfrank the cftc has moved from a principlesbased to a more prescriptive regulatory approach over most aspects of our trading and clearing operations 

over the past five years a number of regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain overthecounter derivatives swap reporting operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting product definitions the definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets swap execution facilities and swap data repositories we continue to believe the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we continue to explore however portions of doddfrank remain subject to further rulemaking and such final regulations could include provisions that negatively impact our business 

our us clearing house has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization these designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities by the federal reserve bank and the cftc 

our us swap data repository service and swap execution facility are also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market economic and political conditions that are beyond our control and that could significantly reduce our contract volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially dependent on the contract volume in our markets our contract volume is directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

  14 

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however as evidenced by our past performance in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital the shifts in market trading patterns we experienced as a result of the financial disturbance of 2008 may or may not recur in the future and our business will be affected by future economic uncertainties which may result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom and the european union we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges to offer our products and services to their citizens 

due to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 the united states and numerous other governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of debating or enacting new laws and regulations that will impact our business while certain of these changes may have a positive impact on our business some of these changes could adversely affect our business including areas of regulatory focus discussed under item 1 – business – regulatory matters beginning on page 11 compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources that could result in some participants leaving our markets or decreasing their trading activity which would negatively affect our profitability we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the extensive regulations that apply to our business to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of doddfrank and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

our clearing houses seek to offer customers intermediaries and clearing firms universal access in order to maximize the efficient use of capital exercise appropriate oversight of value at risk and maintain operating leverage from clearing activities our strategic business plan is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business some of our clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our revenues and profits could be adversely affected 

 15 

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete   our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe portions of doddfrank and the corresponding regulations with respect to mandatory clearing and organized trading provide opportunities for our business however other portions of doddfrank and the regulatory structure being implemented could negatively impact our business and our ability to compete effectively we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and in some cases operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large industry participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do 

our competitors may 

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our fees or loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

please see item 1 – business – competition beginning on page 10 for additional information on the competitive environment and its potential impact on our business 

our contract volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our contract volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution and clearing facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example in recent years some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies such as lowering the fees that they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity payments or rebates we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2015  should a clearing firm withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange however there is the possibility we would lose a portion of the customer business additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our contract volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of contract volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected furthermore declines in 

 16 

contract volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of contract volume 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential commodity and securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while we generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on private causes of actions in cases where we have not behaved in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated andor direct actions brought by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction or that we failed to effectively fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyberattack and other cyber security risks our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and contract volume and result in substantial liabilities we also could be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems andor investigate any alleged attack 

we regard the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our technology our people and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to targeted attacks unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism firewall or encryption failures and other security problems criminal groups and nationstate actors have targeted the financial services industry and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyberattack and other information security threats from time to time we experienced cyber security events including malware infections directed “phishing” attacks against our employees web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size additionally in 2013 we were the victim of a cyber intrusion although we maintain sophisticated systems teams and processes to prevent such incidents and took significant actions to address this incident we learned that certain customer information was compromised we incurred expenses of 160 million related to our response to the 2013 event although we maintain sophisticated systems teams and processes to prevent detect and recover from these events incidents attributable to cyberattack could result in substantial costs and liability to us and diversions of our resources may distract the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and could result in regulatory penalties or the imposition of burdensome obligations by the regulators 

additionally our role as a leading derivatives marketplace and the operation of our cme globex electronic trading platform may place us at greater risk for misappropriation of our intellectual property and persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use or steal our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations in the past we have been the victim of trade secret theft by an employee 

as part of our global information security program we employ resources to monitor and protect our environment and infrastructure against such cyberattacks and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property assets however these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed which could result in system failures and delays loss of customers and lower contract volume and negatively affect our competitive advantage and result in substantial costs and liabilities 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business while we have implemented significant physical security protection measures   business continuity plans and established backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such attack may result in the closure of our trading and clearing facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results

risks relating to our business 

the success of our markets depends on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading systems if we are unable to develop them to include other products and markets or if they do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed desired by our customers our ability to successfully compete and our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems do not operate properly are compromised or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

 18 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak contract volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in contract volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future contract volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual contract volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex contract volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy our goal is to design our systems to handle two times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

we as well as many of our customers depend on thirdparty suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased contract volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of our third party clearing firms and consequently a diminishment in their financial resources could adversely affect us 

our clearing house operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles we routinely guarantee transactions submitted by our clearing firms with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one or more of our clearing firms 

as part of our growth initiatives we have expanded our clearing services to swaps in addition to standard futures and options on futures products the process for setting margins and establishing other financial safeguards for cleared swaps differs from our historical practices although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and establishing financial safeguards for cleared swaps there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect the clearing house in the event of a clearing member default during extreme market conditions 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to the clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help 

 19 

ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a fund currently up to 98 million to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to qualified family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances if their clearing firm member becomes insolvent 

the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market 

to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit collateral to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and foreign sovereign debt and subject them to established haircuts based on the type of collateral and maturity there is no guarantee the collateral will maintain its value to the extent a clearing firm is not compliant with capital margin or guaranty fund requirements it would be required to promptly come into compliance by adding capital or collateral decreasing its proprietary trading activity andor transferring customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products 

intellectual property rights licensed from third party price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue regulatory scrutiny into such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products 

we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from thirdparty price reporting agencies including our benchmark eurodollar contract which is based on libor to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily subject to manipulation our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenues 

our market data revenues may be reduced by decreased demand poor overall economic conditions or a significant change in how market participants trade and use market data 

we sell our market data to individuals trading institutions and other organizations that use our information services to participate in our markets andor monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data and information services represented 12  and 11 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively a decrease in overall contract volume may lead to a decreased demand for our market data for example in both 2015  and 2014  we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data devices due to the continued economic uncertainty continued high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms and the continued impact of legacy incentive programs tied to trading terminals in 2014 we implemented a series of policy changes and price increases effective over 2014 and 2015 we cannot guarantee that the changes or increased cost to our customers will not result in a reduction of the total number of paid subscriptions as users review their business needs for our services 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter markets and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

there is no guarantee that our cleared swaps initiatives will be successful 

our goal is to provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the marketplace for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing houses we offer clearing services for cleared swaps including interest rate credit default foreign exchange and commodity swaps our strategy also includes extending our services into other asset classes as well as enhancing our cme clearport functionality to support additional products while we believe the implementation of doddfrank creates new opportunities for us to expand our offerings the current regulatory environment for trading and clearing these products remains uncertain we cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably under the new legislation also numerous capital changes and provisions in basel iii may result in uncleared 

 20 

bilaterally executed derivatives being less expensive than cleared derivatives in addition a number of market participants and exchanges have developed competing platforms and products including new swap execution facilities we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively or that our initiatives will be successful 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions other investments and strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of the increasing consolidation in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us which could impact our ability to identify growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration also may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from our growth initiatives and investments we have made or will make in the future which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we also may be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively affect our stock price 

expansion of our global operations involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our global operations including through cme clearing europe cme europe and our global repository services directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in marketing our products and services in international markets we also may experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators raised during regulatory examinations or we may otherwise become subject to their inquiry and oversight the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business in 2013 the cftc filed suit against nymex and two former employees alleging disclosure of confidential customer information in violation of the commodity exchange act based on our review of the allegations we believe that we have strong factual and legal defenses to the claim 

 21 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees and agents could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example in 2012 a former employee of cme group pled guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we might still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 22 billion  of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 23 billion  

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our us exchanges and clearing house also are required to maintain capital as defined by the cftc 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the past we have experienced ratings downgrades our failure to maintain our ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital additionally if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of our fixedrate notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

our operations of and investments in businesses outside of the united states subject us to currency risk 

since we conduct business outside of the united states primarily in the united kingdom portions of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars and pounds sterling because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

additionally we have invested in businesses outside of the united states including our investment in bmfbovespa which had a fair value of 1991 million  as of december 31 2015 a decrease in value of the currencies in the foreign jurisdictions   where we have investments would decrease the value of our investments and may have a negative impact on our financial statements 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

 23 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability would be adversely affected 

thirteen of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with the cme members rights to elect six directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

thirteen of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members in 2015  81  of our contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result members may not have the same economic interests as holders of our class a common stock in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their methods of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange also are entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

our class b common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized overthecounter market each class of our class b common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our cme exchange cmes rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights each share of our class b common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights 

class b shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold or leased through our membership department although our class b shareholders have special voting rights because our class b shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our class a shares we expect that the market price of our class b common stock if reported separately from the associated trading rights would be primarily determined by the value of our class a common stock   as of february 10 2016 there were approximately 1600  holders of record of our class b common stock

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders according to our annual dividend policy which is set at between 50 and 60 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to declare a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our future earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant on february 3 2016  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 060  per share the dividend will be payable on march 28 2016  to shareholders of record on march 10 2016  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the total first quarter dividend payment will be approximately 2020 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 290 per share on december 9 2015 paid on january 12 2016 to the shareholders of record on december 28 2015 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined at the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 364day clearing house credit facility for 70 billion and our 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

for example under our senior credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2014 after giving effect to actual share repurchases made and special dividends paid including annual variable dividends but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid after december 31 2014 and in no event greater than 20 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends during the term of the agreement multiplied by 065 in addition our 364day clearing house credit facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 8000 million 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries including cme in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend introduction 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is organized as follows 

 references in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to cme group inc cme group and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively references to “exchange” are to chicago mercantile exchange inc cme the board of trade of the city of chicago inc cbot new york mercantile exchange inc nymex commodity exchange inc comex cme clearing europe limited cmece and cme europe limited cme europe collectively unless otherwise noted 

overview 

business overview 

cme group a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for cme cbot nymex comex and their respective subsidiaries as well as cmece and cme europe the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme groups class a common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” 

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts we also clear futures options on futures and swaps contracts through our two clearing houses cme clearing which is a division of cme and cmece futures contracts options on futures contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals we also clear swaps contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates credit default foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals 

our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our cme and cmece clearing houses 

our clearing houses clear settle and guarantee futures and options contracts traded through our exchange in addition to cleared swaps products our clearing houses performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing houses as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies 

in addition cme serves as a swap execution facility which is a regulated platform for swap trading and serves as a swap data repository which provides public data on swap transactions and stores confidential swap data for regulatory purposes

business trends 

economic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite economic uncertainty and volatility trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the united states and european credit crises fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the federal reserve bank’s recent zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing trading activity in our energy and agricultural product lines have fluctuated due to ongoing price volatility within those markets we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment  our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of recent regulatory reforms in the financial services industry competition is influenced by our reputation the efficiency and security of our services depth and liquidity of our markets breadth of product offerings including rate and quality of new product development our ability to position and expand upon existing products transparency reliability and anonymity of transaction processing the regulatory environment efficient and innovative technology and connectivity as well as transaction costs we believe we are very well situated with respect to these factors we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as markets continue to evolve we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers 

regulatory environment  exchangetraded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation as a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over recent years various domestic and foreign governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of enacting new laws and regulations that will apply to our business compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability 

our us futures exchanges and our clearing house are subject to extensive regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc which carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act the commodity futures modernization act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank over the last five years a number of regulations to implement doddfrank were finalized while we believe that the new regulations will provide opportunities for our business the new regulations remain subject to additional rulemaking by various regulators our us clearing house has been designated by the cftc as a systemically important derivatives clearing organization which imposes various new procedural and substantive requirements our us swap data repository service and swap execution facility are also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the provisions of doddfrank and any new regulations 

as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign locations where we do business the financial services industry in europe has recently undergone regulatory reform and a reorganization of its regulatory framework our european operations are now overseen by several regulators including the bank of england the financial conduct authority fca and the european securities market authority esma we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the new regulations in europe 

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on leveraging our benchmark products enhancing our customer relations expanding our customer base advancing our clearing and trading technologies and deriving benefits from our integrated clearing houses as well as our scalable infrastructure we focus specifically on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes we believe that we can build on our competitive strengths by executing on the following initiatives 

  31 

 revenues 

clearing and transaction fees  a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for exchangetraded and cleared swaps contracts because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenues 

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts fee limits and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

product mix we offer exchangetraded futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearedonly swap contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates credit default equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products 

venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions privately negotiated transactions include block trades which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on cme globex or the trading floor privately negotiated transactions also include volume submitted through cme clearport and exchange for related positions efrps 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services access and communication fees and various services related to our exchange and building operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through thirdparty distributors 

 32 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotations trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

access and communication fees access and communication fees are charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services our communication services include our colocation program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers 

other revenues other revenues include fees for administrating our interest earning facility ief program trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships and other services to members and clearing firms we offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various ief offerings these clearing firms receive interest income and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit 

to further diversify the range of services we offer we have entered into processing and development agreements with other exchanges and service organizations for example we have an agreement with bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa where we have developed a new multiasset class electronic trading platform for their customers we recognized revenue under this agreement as services were provided and when developed technology was delivered 

in addition other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by gfx corporation gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that trades futures contracts in a fully hedged book to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for certain products 

expenses 

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume however licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity energy and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to stock options restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices the fair value of options is derived using the blackscholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility the riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options granted 

professional fees and outside services  this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives and legal proceedings 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements furniture fixtures and equipment this expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

 33 

other expenses we incur amortization of intangible assets and additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include noncore investing and financing activities 

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting price policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized 

 34 

financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value 

 for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 19 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangibles assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 

revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing houses clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests 

income taxes  calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the 

 35 

technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs  certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally three years amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new standard on revenue recognition that replaces numerous industryspecific requirements and converges us accounting with international financial reporting standards the new standard introduces a framework for recognizing revenue that focuses on the transfer of control rather than risks and rewards the new standard also requires significant additional disclosures about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract the new standard was intended to become effective in the first annual period beginning after december 15 2016 but in august 2015 fasb extended the deadline by one year this guidance may be adopted using one of two transition methods which we are still evaluating along with the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements 

in april 2015 the fasb issued a standards update that changes the presentation of debt issuance costs the update requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability the update which applies retrospectively upon adoption is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2015 early adoption is allowed adoption of the update will change the presentation of debt issuance costs and the carrying value of debt in our consolidated balance sheets adoption of the update is considered a change in accounting policy and will be disclosed accordingly we believe the change in presentation will be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 

in november 2015 the fasb issued a standards update that simplifies the classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities the update eliminates the current requirement for entities to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet instead entities will now be required to classify all deferred tax assets along with valuation allowances and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent entities are still required to offset deferred tax assets and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax jurisdiction the new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 but earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period the update may be adopted on either a prospective or retrospective basis we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2016 the fasb issued a standards update that will change how entities measure certain equity investments it does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans under the new guidance entities will have to measure many equity investments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for a practicability exception entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available for sale in other comprehensive income the update is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued a standards update that requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities associated with the rights and obligations created by those leases the guidance for lessors is largely unchanged from current us gaap under the new guidance a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months consistent with current us gaap the recognition measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease the update is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 early adoption is permitted we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements

financial highlights 

the following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented 



nm not meaningful 

revenues 



clearing and transaction fees 

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract for futures and options total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing houses and certain clearedonly contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures exclude credit default swaps and interest rate swaps the credit default swaps and interest rate swaps are discussed in a later section 



we estimate the following increases decreases in clearing and transaction fees based on change in total contract volume and change in average rate per contract during 2015  compared with 2014  and during 2014  compared with 2013  



average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure including volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the 

 37 

relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation 

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume contract volume can be influenced by many factors including political and economic factors the regulatory environment and market competition 



overall futures and options contract volume increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by an increase in energy contract volume the fall in crude oil prices that began in the fourth quarter of 2014 continued through 2015 and resulted in several periods of high volatility this was heavily influenced by the increase in global crude oil supplies which have outpaced demand 

following higher contract volumes in 2014 led by geopolitical concerns in russia and ukraine and falling soybean prices agricultural commodity contract volume continued to increase in 2015 large amounts of rain due to changing weather patterns caused by el niño during 2015 created concerns over planting delays for agricultural commodity products in the united states we believe this resulted in increases in price volatility across the sector which has led to increases in overall agricultural commodity contract volumes 

in 2015 when compared with 2014 overall interest rate contract volume decreased following significant volumes in 2014 interest rate contract volume in 2014 reached a historical high as improved macroeconomic indicators led to changing expectations regarding nearterm federal reserve actions this historical high has also contributed to overall increase in volumes in 2014 compared with 2013 

 38 

interest rate products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years   



overall interest rate contract volume decreased in 2015 when compared with 2014 primarily due to a decline in longerdated interest rate contract volume as market participants anticipated a potential change in interest rates in the near term in 2015 we believe they shifted their focus from back 32 eurodollar futures and longerdated us treasury futures and options to shorter term products including the 2year us treasury futures and options while interest rate volatility remained high in early 2015 changes in macroeconomic factors and a shift from the first quarters expectations regarding the federal reserve interest rate policy change lowered interest rate volatility throughout the remainder of 2015 

in 2014 when compared with 2013 overall interest rate volumes increased due to higher volumes for us treasury contracts and eurodollar futures and options contracts particularly with shortterm contracts we believe the growth was a result of increased volatility driven by changing expectations regarding nearterm federal reserve actions in addition we believe the growth in eurodollar options volume was attributable to increased sales efforts despite overall increases in interest rate volumes treasury bond volumes decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 us treasury volumes were high in the first half of 2013 due to short periods of high volatility created by the federal reserves activities with respect to its quantitative easing program 

equity products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity products 



overall equity contract volume remained flat in 2015 when compared with 2014 because volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index remained high in both periods global economic events led by a deceleration of the chinese economy in the second half of 2015 resulted in high market volatility in 2015 in 2014 high volatility resulted from geopolitical events in russia ukraine and the middle east the emini nasdaq contract volume did not benefit from macrolevel events or increased general market volatility to the same extent as the emini sp 500 because the emini nasdaq contract generally hedges different market risks 

we believe the increase in overall equity contract volume in 2014 when compared with 2013 resulted from geopolitical events in russia and ukraine as well as the middle east that led to periods of relatively high volatility in the second half of 2014 we believe the increase in volume was also due to a more gradual increase in broad market volatility during the second half of 2014 caused by uncertainty surrounding interest rates and other geopolitical uncertainty the increase in the emini nasdaq contract volume was due to market participants shifting attention to the nasdaq100 index which had slightly higher volatility than the sp 500 throughout most of the year 

 39 

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products 



foreign exchange contract volume increased in 2015 when compared with 2014 primarily due to an increase in euro contract volume cause by quantitative easing and debt concerns in europe global economic uncertainty geopolitical events as well as a strengthening us dollar throughout 2015 we believe these factors led to increases in exchange rate volatility 

in 2014 when compared with 2013 the overall decrease in foreign exchange contract volume was attributable to a decrease in exchange rate volatility across all major currencies we believe subdued expectations regarding interest rate changes across european countries and japan led to a decrease in exchange rate volatility throughout these regions additionally we believe allegations regarding possible collusion by certain foreign exchange market participants in other marketplaces had a continued negative impact on overall global foreign exchange product trading during 2014 despite the overall decline in volume for the year volume did improve during the second half of 2014 largely due to volatility created by global economic uncertainty and geopolitical risk 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products 



agricultural commodity product volume increased in 2015 when compared with 2014 due to changes in weather patterns caused by el niño an increase in rainfall across the united states during 2015 resulted in concerns over planting delays which we believe led to an increase in volatility within the agricultural commodity markets 

in 2014 when compared with 2013 agricultural commodity contract volume increased due to higher wheat contract volume in 2014 which we believe was caused by geopolitical concerns in russia and ukraine substantial increases in the production of corn and soybeans in 2014 encouraged hedgers to more aggressively seek protection against falling prices which we believe resulted in an increase in volume 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products 



overall energy contract volume increased in 2015 when compared with 2014 largely due to an increase in crude oil contract volume caused by higher volatility we believe the increase in crude oil volatility resulted from a continuing shift in crude oil supply that began in the fourth quarter of 2014 additionally refined products and natural gas contract volumes increased largely due to higher price volatility in the underlying markets 

 40 

total energy contract volume decreased slightly in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to a decline in natural gas contract volume which we believe was attributable to low overall price levels resulting from increasing us energy production crude oil volume increased in 2014 particularly in the fourth quarter due to a shift in supply and demand which resulted in high volatility within the oil markets 

metal products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products 



metal contract volume remained flat in 2015 compared with 2014 we believe that demand was stagnant due to lower economic growth rates in asia resulted in reduced volatility throughout 2014 and 2015 

overall metal contract volume decreased in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to lower price volatility prices remained stable due to a strengthening us dollar and the expectation of an increase in us interest rates in addition we believe demand for gold continued to slow due to lower economic growth rates in india and china which are both large consumers of gold 

average rate per contract 

the average rate per contract increased in 2015 when compared with 2014 due to a shift in relative mix of product volume energy and agricultural commodity contract volumes when measured as a percentage of total volume collectively increased by 3 percentage points in 2015 while interest rate contract volume decreased by 3 percentage points energy and agricultural commodity contracts have a higher average rate per contract compared with interest rates in addition price increases implemented in february 2015 resulted in a 2 increase in the average rate per contract in 2015 when compared with 2014 

in 2014 when compared with 2013 the average rate per contract decreased due to a shift in the relative mix of product volume interest rate contract volume when measured as a percentage of total volume increased by 4 percentage points in 2014 while all other product lines decreased interest rate contracts have a lower average rate per contract compared with other product lines in addition an increase in incentives and discounts on our energy contracts also resulted in a decrease in the average rate per contract in 2014 when compared with 2013 

clearedonly swap contracts 

clearing and transaction fees as presented on the consolidated statements of income include revenues for our clearedonly interest rate swap and credit default swap contracts in 2015 2014 and 2013 clearing and transaction fees generated from these contracts were 670 million 595 million and 323 million respectively the increases in revenues were largely attributable to increased sales efforts centered around customer education the increase in revenue in 2014 when compared with 2013 was also attributable to an increase in cme interest rate swap contract volume resulting from the overthecounter clearing mandate required to be implemented in 2013 by doddfrank 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2015 and one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2014  one firm represented 11  and another firm represented 10  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2013  should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm 

other sources of revenue 

market data and information services 

the increase in market data and information services revenues in 2015 when compared with 2014 was attributable to the reduction of fee waivers for certain existing customers beginning in 2015 the increase in market data and information services revenues in 2014 when compared with 2013 was attributable to a 15 fee increase per device for basic realtime market data 

 41 

services at the beginning of 2014 the increase was partially offset by costcutting initiatives at customer firms as well as continued utilization of a legacy incentive program 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented in aggregate 43  44  and 52  of our market data and information services revenue in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 

other revenue in 2014 we recognized 19 million in fees earned under our technology agreement with bmfbovespa compared with 87 million in 2013 in addition we sold the nymex building in the fourth quarter of 2013 which resulted in a decrease in rental income in 2014 when compared with 2013 in 2013 we also recognized 51 million of insurance proceeds related to hurricane sandy these events contributed to the decrease in other revenues in 2014 when compared with 2013 

expenses

operating expenses decreased by 60 million  in 2015 when compared with 2014 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the net decrease in operating expenses

 increases in overall operating expenses in 2014 when compared with 2013 were partially offset by the following decreases 

  43 

 nonoperating income expense 



  

nm not meaningful 

investment income in 2015 when compared with 2014 the overall decrease in investment income was largely due to a net loss of 85 million on the sale of approximately 410 million shares of our investment in bmfbovespa during 2015 this loss was partially offset by an increase in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions as a result of larger collateral balances held 

the overall decrease in investment income in 2014 when compared with 2013 was largely due to a decrease in dividend income and a reduced gain on marketable securities related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan gains and losses from securities in the nonqualified deferred compensation plan are offset by an equal amount of compensation and benefits expense the overall decrease was partially offset by an increase in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that were reinvested the increase in cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions was due to an increase in open interest as well as a shift in clearing firm collateral preferences towards cash 

interest and other borrowing costs the following table shows the weighted average borrowings outstanding weighted average effective yield and average cost of borrowing for the periods presented 



1 average cost of borrowings includes interest the effective portion of interest rate hedges discount accretion and debt issuance costs commitment fees on line of credit agreements are not included in the average cost of borrowings 

in february 2014 we repaid the 7500 million 575 notes due february 2014 and in april 2015 we repurchased the 6125 million 440 notes due march 2018 in march 2015 we issued 7500 million 30 notes due march 2025 these transactions contributed to decreases in weighted average effective yield and average cost of borrowings from 2013 through 2015 the weighted average borrowings outstanding increased slightly in 2015 when compared with 2014 due to the replacement of the 6125 million 440 notes with the 7500 million 30 notes in early 2015 the weighted average borrowings outstanding decreased in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to the repayment of the 7500 million 575 notes in february 2014 

equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries higher income generated from our spdji business venture contributed to increases in equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries from 2013 through 2015 

other income expense in april 2015 we repurchased the 6125 million 440 notes due 2018 and paid a call premium of 605 million as a result of the transaction we recognized debt prepayment costs of 618 million including the call premium as other nonoperating income expense in the first quarter of 2015 we received a termination fee of 225 million net of the 

 44 

portion paid to outside advisers related to our proposed acquisition of gfi group which also was classified as other nonoperating income expense 

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 



the effective tax rate in 2015 was relatively flat compared with the effective tax rate in 2014 because the deferred income tax benefit resulting from remeasurement of the deferred income tax balances in 2015 related to changes in state and local apportionment factors and enacted state and local law changes was comparable to similar benefits arising from audit settlements and remeasurement of deferred income tax balances in 2014 

in 2014 when compared with 2013 the overall effective tax rate decreased due to lower deferred income tax expense related to changes in estimates of state and local apportionment factors as well as benefits related to settlements from state and local audits we also continued to recognize a benefit for the domestic productions activity deduction in 2014 however the benefits for the domestic production activities recognized in 2014 were lower than the benefits recognized in 2013 because the benefits recognized in 2013 included the impact of refunds claimed for 2008 through 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

we have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations while our cost structure is fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments however it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015  these were as follows 

  

 operating leases include rent payments for office space in chicago new york and other smaller offices in the united states and in various foreign countries the operating lease for our headquarters in chicago expires in november 2022 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 119 million  to 135 million  we also maintain operating leases for additional office spaces in chicago which expire in november 2023 and april 2027 annual minimum rental payments under these leases range from 55 million  to 62 million  and  32 million  to  43 million  respectively the operating lease for our office space in new york expires in december 2028 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 131 million to 145 million 

purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to advertising licensing hardware software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services debt obligations include repayment of principal and interest associated with the debt obligations other longterm liabilities include funding obligations for other postretirement benefit plans 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity performance improvements as well as improvements to some of our office spaces each year capital expenditures are 

 45 

incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data centers telecommunications network and other operating equipment in 2016  we expect capital expenditures to total approximately 1150 million to 1200 million we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders which is set at between 50 to 60 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant cme group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends on february 3 2016  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 060  per share the dividend will be payable on march 28 2016  to shareholders of record on march 10 2016  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately 2020 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 290 per share on december 9 2015 paid on january 12 2016 to the shareholders of record on december 28 2015 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

sources and uses of cash 

the following is a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



nm not meaningful 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2015 when compared with 2014 largely due to increases in clearing and transaction fees and market data revenues in 2015 

net cash provided by operating activities remained relatively flat in 2014 when compared with 2013 an increase in cash provided by operating activities due to increased volume was offset by a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities resulting from higher payments of accrued expenses in 2014 when compared with 2013 we paid a higher bonus in 2014 when compared with the bonus payment in 2013 additionally we had higher payments in 2014 for legal and other consulting services primarily related to remediation efforts for an information security breach that occurred in 2013 

investing activities 

the increase in cash provided by investing activities in 2015 when compared with 2014 was due to proceeds from the sale of bmfbovespa shares in 2015 this increase was partially offset by additional investments in business ventures in 2014 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2014 when compared with 2013 was largely due to proceeds from the sale of a building in new york and the settlement of a derivative contract related to our debt offering in 2013 in addition there were additional investments in business ventures in 2014 which contributed to the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2014 when compared with 2013 

financing activities 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2015 when compared with 2014 was largely due to the proceeds received from the issuance of the 7500 million fixed rate notes in march 2015 

cash used in financing activities was higher in 2014 when compared with 2013 the increase in cash used was attributable to an increase in cash dividends of 09 billion in 2014 when compared with 2013 the annual variable dividend from 2013 operations was paid in the first quarter of 2014 the annual variable dividend from 2012 operations was paid in the fourth quarter of 2012 instead of the first quarter of 2013 due to uncertainty surrounding dividend income tax treatment beginning in 2013 the increase in cash used was also due to the repayment of the fixed rate notes due february 2014

debt instruments 

the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2015  

  

 we maintain a 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions which matures in march 2020 the proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes which includes providing liquidity for our clearing houses in certain circumstances at cme groups discretion and if necessary for maturities of commercial paper as long as we are not in default under this facility we have the option to increase it up to 30 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds this facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty under this facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test which is defined as our consolidated shareholders equity at december 31 2014 giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements and in no event greater than 20 billion in aggregate multiplied by 065 we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility 

we maintain a 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing the facility provides for borrowings of up to 70 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian for our collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms cme clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or us treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility at december 31 2015  guaranty funds available to collateralize the facility totaled 64 billion we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion our 364day facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as cme consolidated shareholders equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 8000 million we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility and our 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility for 70 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

at december 31 2015  we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 23 billion under our multicurrency revolving senior credit facilities 

at december 31 2015  we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

to satisfy our performance bond obligation with singapore exchange limited we may pledge cmeowned us treasury securities in lieu of or in combination with irrevocable letters of credit at december 31 2015  we had pledged letters of credit totaling 6100 million

the following table summarizes our credit ratings as of december 31 2015  



given our cash flow generation our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities if necessary we expect to maintain an investment grade rating if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101  of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2015  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the securities and exchange commission

cash and cash equivalents totaled 17 billion  at december 31 2015  and 14 billion  at december 31 2014  the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices a majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in us treasury securities or us government agency securities our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that an 117 million  contribution in 2016  will allow us to meet our funding goal however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2016  and the december 31 2016  discount rate

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2015  consisted of fixedrate borrowings of 22 billion  changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixedrate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows we did not have any variablerate borrowings at december 31 2015  

credit risk 

our clearing houses act as the counterparties to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through thirdparty exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

 48 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for exchangetraded and swaps products including interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for cme and cmece clearing firms we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk we establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity we marktomarket open positions of cme and cmece clearing firms at least once a day twice a day for futures and options contracts and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value we have the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant these practices allow our clearing houses to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing houses to ensure performance of their open positions 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity 

despite our safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

cme clearing 

we maintain three separate financial safeguard packages for cme clearing member firms 

 in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit 

we maintain a 70 billion 364day multicurrency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or us treasury securities performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day multicurrency line of credit we also have the option to use our 23 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing houses in the unlikely event of default 

at december 31 2015 aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for all three cme financial safeguard packages was 1281 billion  including 335 billion  of cash performance bond deposits and 26 billion  of letters of credit a defaulting firms performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm

 cmece 

we maintain two separate financial safeguard packages for cmece clearing member firms 

 under the financial safeguard package for cmece commodity and foreign exchange clearing firms we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations in the unlikely event of default by a cmece clearing firm these assets include the defaulting firms performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions thereafter if the default remains unsatisfied after first applying assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation we would use guaranty fund contributions of 520 million  from cmece funds clearing firms contributions to the commodity and foreign exchange guaranty fund totaled 106 million  at december 31 2015  once clearing firms fully contribute to the guaranty fund we would use at least 200 million of cmece funds in addition to the clearing firms guaranty fund contributions in the event of a default of a commodity or foreign exchange clearing firm 

we also maintain a financial safeguard package for cmece interest rate swap clearing firms in the unlikely event of default by a cmece clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations these assets include the defaulting firms performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions if the default remains unsatisfied we would apply guaranty fund contributions of 482 million  that will be contributed by cmece the interest rate swap clearing firms contributions to the interest rate swap guaranty fund totaled 949 million  at december 31 2015  

aggregate cash performance bond deposits for cmece clearing firms for the commodity and foreign exchange clearing firms and interest rate swap clearing firms were 556 million  at december 31 2015  there were no noncash performance bonds on deposit at december 31 2015  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on british pound cash balances held at subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result when subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency hold cash as well as certain other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies during 2015 the exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar fluctuated from a high of 159 per pound to a low of 146 per pound aggregate transaction gains losses for 2015  2014  and 2013  were 113 million 154 million and 54 million respectively we expect the foreign currency gainloss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold cash as well as certain assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets and liabilities we report in our consolidated balance sheets the financial statements of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in various currencies and are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income aggregate translation gains losses net of tax for 2015  2014  and 2013  were 66 million  31 million  and 05 million  respectively 

foreign currency risk related to equity investments 

we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain equity investments as discussed in the equity price risk section below 

foreign currency exchange risk related to customer collateral 

a portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in foreign currency we marktomarket all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price therefore our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results 

 51 

equity price risk 

we hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes publiclytraded equity investments are recorded at their fair value and are based on quoted market prices fair values are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value fluctuations in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 

the table below summarizes equity investments that are subject to equity price fluctuations at december 31 2015  equity investments are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 



1 substantially all of the difference between the cost basis and fair value of the investment as of december 31 2015 represents previous changes in foreign currency exchange rates that are suspended in accumulated other comprehensive income and released into current operations as the investment is sold 

we do not currently hedge against equity price risk equity investments are assessed for otherthantemporary impairment on a quarterly basis

seasonality 

generally we have historically experienced relatively higher contract volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower contract volume in the third and fourth quarters however such seasonality also may be impacted by general market conditions or other events during 2014  25  of our consolidated revenues were recognized in the first quarter 24  in the second quarter 24  in the third quarter and 27  in the fourth quarter 

working capital 

we generally meet our funding requirements with internally generated funds supplemented from time to time with public debt and commercial paper offerings for more information on our working capital needs see “managements discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition—liquidity and capital resources” beginning on page 45 which section is incorporated herein by reference 

customer base 

our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers governments and central banks our customers can connect to our cme globex electronic trading platform from access points across the globe customers may be members of one or more of our cme cbot nymex or comex exchanges rights to directly access our markets will depend upon the nature of the customer such as whether the individual is a member of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access 

us trading rights and privileges are exchangespecific trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by our members membership on one of our us futures exchanges also enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees under the terms of the organizational documents of our us exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections in 2014  80  of our contract volume was conducted by our members 

the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represents charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2014  in the event a clearing firm were to withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven by regulatory reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank emir markets in financial instruments directive ii mifid ii capital requirements directive iv crd iv market abuse directive basel iii and various other laws and regulations 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 14 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties 

competition in our derivatives business 

we believe competition in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from others in the industry we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality maintain liquidity and low transaction costs and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers 

we compete in a large financial services trading clearing and settlement marketplace globally our competitors include among other entities exchanges such as intercontinental exchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited and deutsche börse ag competition in our industry continues to be dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business for example the development of swap execution facilities and the mandated trading andor clearing requirement for certain cleared swaps and privately negotiated products may lead to the creation of platforms that promote competitive substitutes for our exchangetraded and privately negotiated products 

additionally we face competition from substitute markets these substitutes can take the form of swaps contracts identical or similar to our listed futures contracts or risksimilar products on spot and cash markets securities exchanges exchange traded funds and other instruments and other venues and mechanisms that can serve to offset economic risks 

competition in our transaction processing business 

in addition we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with the continued implementation of and compliance with doddfrank 

our competitors in the clearing services space include among others companies such as ice lchswapclear the options clearing corporation depository trust  clearing corporation and deutsche börse ag in light of the implementation of doddfranks clearing mandate and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing services 

we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the value of providing customers with capital efficiencies quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house timely delivery of the services reputation offering breadth confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the fees charged for the services provided 

 10 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities which could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products although we may receive license fees for such products such fees may not offset the impact of any loss in revenue from our comparable product 

regulatory matters 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom and the european union we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges and other businesses to offer our products and services to their citizens 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 14 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties 

regulation in the united states 

our operation of us futures exchanges and our us clearing house is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc which requires that our regulated subsidiaries satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures markets and clearing houses in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years following the enactment of doddfrank the cftc has moved from a principlesbased to a more prescriptive regulatory approach over most aspects of our trading and clearing operations 

over the past four years a number of regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain overthecounter derivatives swap reporting operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting product definitions the definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets swap execution facilities and swap data repositories we continue to believe the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we continue to explore however portions of doddfrank remain subject to further rulemaking and such final regulations could include provisions that negatively impact our business 

our us clearing house has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization these designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities by the federal reserve bank and the cftc 

our us swap data repository service and swap execution facility are also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc 

regulation in the united kingdom and the european union 

in the united kingdom the government approved a reorganization of its regulatory framework under which the financial services authority was dissolved and its oversight responsibilities were transitioned in 2013 primarily to the bank of england and the fca as a result in the united kingdom our operations are subject to multiple regulators the bank of england the fca and esma cme clearing our us clearing house is subject to certain conditions and reporting obligations as a result of its recognition by esma the european union also is undergoing similar change establishing multiple supervisory authorities for financial services including esma multiple directives and regulations such as mifid ii and changes to the markets in financial instruments regulation mifir the capital requirements regulations iv and the market abuse directive have been proposed with provisions similar to those contained in doddfrank 

key areas of focus 

we actively monitor and participate in the domestic and international rulemaking processes for our industry including providing government testimony commenting on proposed rulemakings and educating our regulators on potential impacts to the marketplace 

our key areas of focus in the regulatory environment are

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market economic and political conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our contract volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially dependent on the contract volume in our markets our contract volume is directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

  14 

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however as evidenced by our past performance in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital the shifts in market trading patterns we experienced as a result of the financial disturbance of 2008 may or may not recur in the future and our business will be affected by future economic uncertainties which may result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states the united kingdom and the european union we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges to offer our products and services to their citizens 

due to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 the united states and numerous other governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of debating or enacting new laws and regulations that will impact our business while certain of these changes may have a positive impact on our business some of these changes could adversely affect our business including areas of regulatory focus discussed under item 1 – business – regulatory matters beginning on page 11 compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources that could result in some participants leaving our markets or decreasing their trading activity which would negatively affect our profitability we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the extensive regulations that apply to our business to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of doddfrank and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

our clearing houses seek to offer customers intermediaries and clearing firms universal access in order to maximize the efficient use of capital exercise appropriate oversight of value at risk and maintain operating leverage from clearing activities our strategic business plan is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business some of our clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our revenues and profits could be adversely affected 

 15 

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete   our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe portions of doddfrank and the corresponding regulations with respect to mandatory clearing and organized trading provide opportunities for our business however other portions of doddfrank and the regulatory structure being implemented could negatively impact our business and our ability to compete effectively we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and in some cases operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large industry participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do 

our competitors may 

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our fees or loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

please see item 1 – business – competition beginning on page 10 for additional information on the competitive environment and its potential impact on our business 

our contract volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our contract volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution and clearing facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example in recent years some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies such as lowering the fees that they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity payments or rebates we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2014  should a clearing firm withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange however there is the possibility we would lose a portion of the customer business additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our contract volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of contract volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected furthermore declines in 

 16 

contract volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of contract volume 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential commodity and securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while we generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on private causes of actions in cases where we have not behaved in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated andor direct actions brought by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction or that we failed to effectively fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks our networks and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and contract volume and result in substantial liabilities we also could be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems andor investigate any alleged attack 

we regard the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our networks and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism firewall or encryption failures and other security problems groups have targeted the financial services industry and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other information security risks from time to time we experienced cyber security events including malware infections phishing web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size additionally in 2013 we were the victim of a cyber intrusion although we maintain sophisticated systems teams and processes to prevent such incidents and took significant actions to address this incident we learned that certain customer information was compromised we incurred expenses of 160 million related to our response to the 2013 event any future alleged incidents could result in substantial costs and liability to us and diversions of our resources may distract the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and could result in regulatory penalties or the imposition of burdensome obligations by the regulators 

additionally our role as a leading derivatives marketplace and the operation of our cme globex electronic trading platform may place us at greater risk for misappropriation of our intellectual property for example in 2012 a former employee of cme group pled guilty to theft of our trade secrets other persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 

as part of our global information security program we employ resources to monitor and protect our environment and infrastructure against such cyber attacks and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property assets however these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed which could result in system failures and delays loss of customers and lower contract volume and negatively affect our competitive advantage and result in substantial costs and liabilities 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business while we have implemented significant physical security protection measures   business continuity plans and established backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such attack may result in the closure of our trading and clearing facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results

risks relating to our business 

the success of our markets depends on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading systems if we are unable to develop them to include other products and markets or if they do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed desired by our customers our ability to successfully compete and our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems do not operate properly are compromised or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

 18 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak contract volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in contract volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future contract volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual contract volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex contract volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy our goal is to design our systems to handle two times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

we as well as many of our customers depend on thirdparty suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased contract volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of our third party clearing firms and consequently a diminishment in their financial resources could adversely affect us 

our clearing house operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles we routinely guarantee transactions submitted by our clearing firms with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers firms in the financial industry have experienced significant uncertainty and negative conditions as a result of the continued fallout from the financial crisis of 2008 we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one or more of our clearing firms 

as part of our growth initiatives we have expanded our clearing services to swaps in addition to standard futures and options on futures products the process for setting margins and establishing other financial safeguards for cleared swaps differs from our historical practices although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and establishing financial safeguards for cleared swaps there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect the clearing house in the event of a clearing member default during extreme market conditions 

 19 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to the clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a fund currently up to 98 million to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to qualified family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances if their clearing firm member becomes insolvent 

the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market 

to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit collateral to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and foreign sovereign debt and subject them to established haircuts based on the type of collateral and maturity there is no guarantee the collateral will maintain its value to the extent a clearing firm is not compliant with capital margin or guaranty fund requirements it would be required to promptly come into compliance by adding capital or collateral decreasing its proprietary trading activity andor transferring customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products 

intellectual property rights licensed from third party price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue regulatory scrutiny into such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products 

we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from thirdparty price reporting agencies including our benchmark eurodollar contract which is based on libor to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily subject to manipulation our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenues 

our market data revenues may be reduced by decreased demand poor overall economic conditions or a significant change in how market participants trade and use market data 

we sell our market data to individuals trading institutions and other organizations that use our information services to participate in our markets andor monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data and information services represented 11  of our total revenues during both the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  a decrease in overall contract volume may lead to a decreased demand for our market data for example in both 2014  and 2013  we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data devices due to the continued economic uncertainty continued high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms and the continued impact of legacy incentive programs tied to trading terminals in 2014 we implemented a series of policy changes and price increases effective over 2014 and 2015 we cannot guarantee that the changes or increased cost to our customers will not result in a reduction of the total number of paid subscriptions as users review their business needs for our services 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter markets and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

there is no guarantee that our cleared swaps initiatives will be successful 

our goal is to provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the marketplace for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing houses we offer clearing services for cleared swaps including interest rate credit default foreign exchange and commodity swaps our strategy also includes extending our services into other asset classes as well as enhancing our cme clearport functionality to support additional products while we believe the implementation of doddfrank creates new opportunities for us to expand our offerings the current regulatory 

 20 

environment for trading and clearing these products remains uncertain we cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably under the new legislation also numerous capital changes and provisions in basel iii may result in uncleared bilaterally executed derivatives being less expensive than cleared derivatives in addition a number of market participants and exchanges have developed competing platforms and products including new swap execution facilities we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively or that our initiatives will be successful 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions other investments and strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of the increasing consolidation in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us to the extent the trend of consolidation in our industry continues we may encounter increased difficulties in identifying growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration also may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from our growth initiatives and investments we have made or will make in the future which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we also may be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively affect our stock price 

expansion of our global operations involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our global operations including through cme clearing europe cme europe and our global repository services directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in marketing our products and services in international markets we also may experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators raised during regulatory examinations or we may otherwise become subject to their inquiry and oversight the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business in 2013 the cftc filed suit against nymex 

 21 

and two former employees alleging disclosure of confidential customer information in violation of the commodity exchange act based on our review of the allegations we believe that we have strong factual and legal defenses to the claim 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees and agents could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example in 2012 a former employee of cme group pled guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

 22 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we might still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 21 billion  of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 18 billion  

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our us exchanges and clearing house also are required to maintain capital as defined by the cftc 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the past we have experienced ratings downgrades our failure to maintain our ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital additionally if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of our fixedrate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

our operations of and investments in businesses outside of the united states could subject us to currency risk 

since we conduct business outside of the united states primarily in the united kingdom portions of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars and pounds sterling because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate nonus dollar denominated revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies may affect our operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

additionally we have invested in businesses outside of the united states including our investment in bmfbovespa which had a fair value of 4108 million as of december 31 2014 a decrease in value of the currencies in the foreign jurisdictions   where we have investments would decrease the value of our investments and may have a negative impact on our financial statements 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

we have historically experienced relatively higher contract volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower contract volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in 

 23 

each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability would be adversely affected 

thirteen of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their rights to elect directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

thirteen of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members in 2014  80  of our contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result members may not have the same economic interests as holders of our class a common stock in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their methods of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange also are entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

our class b common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized overthecounter market each class of our class b common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our cme exchange cmes rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights each share of our class b common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights 

class b shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold or leased through our shareholder relations and membership services department although our class b shareholders have special voting rights because our class b shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our class a shares we expect that the market price of our class b common stock if reported separately from the associated trading rights would be determined by the value of our class a common stock   as of february 11 2015 there were approximately 1610  holders of record of our class b common stock 

dividends 

the following table sets forth the dividends we paid on our class a and class b common stock in the last two years 



we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders according to our annual dividend policy which remains at approximately 50 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to declare a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our future earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant on february 4 2015  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 050  per share the dividend will be payable on march 25 2015  to shareholders of record on march 10 2015  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the total first quarter dividend payment will be approximately 1680 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 200 per share on december 10 2014 paid on january 13 2015 to the shareholders of record on december 29 2014 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined at the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 364day clearing house credit facility for 70 billion and our 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

for example under our senior credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of september 30 2012 after giving effect to actual share repurchases made and special dividends paid including annual variable dividends but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid after september 30 2012 and in no event greater than 20 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends during the term of the agreement multiplied by 065 in addition our 364day clearing house credit facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 8000 million

business trends 

economic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite recent economic uncertainty and volatility in recent years trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the united states and european credit crises fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the federal reserve bank’s continued zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment  our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of recent regulatory reforms in the financial services industry competition is influenced by our reputation the efficiency and security of our services depth and liquidity of our markets breadth of product offerings including rate and quality of new product development our ability to position and expand upon existing products transparency reliability and anonymity of transaction processing the regulatory environment efficient and innovative technology and connectivity as well as transaction costs we believe we are very well situated with respect to these factors we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as markets continue to evolve we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers 

regulatory environment  exchangetraded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation as a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over recent years various domestic and foreign governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of enacting new laws and regulations that will apply to our business compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability 

our futures exchanges and our us clearing house are subject to extensive regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc which carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act the commodity futures modernization act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank over the last four years a number of regulations to implement doddfrank were finalized while we believe that the new regulations will provide opportunities for our business the new regulations remain subject to additional rulemaking by various regulators our us clearing house has been designated by the cftc as a systemically important derivatives clearing organization which imposes various new procedural and substantive requirements our us swap data repository service and swap execution facility are also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the provisions of doddfrank and any new regulations 

as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign locations where we do business the financial services industry in europe has recently undergone regulatory reform and a reorganization of its regulatory framework our european operations are now overseen by several regulators including the bank of england the financial conduct authority fca and the european securities market authority esma we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the new regulations in europe

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on leveraging our benchmark products enhancing our customer relations expanding our customer base advancing our clearing and trading technologies and deriving benefits from our integrated clearing houses as well as our scalable infrastructure we focus specifically on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes we believe that we can build on our competitive strengths by executing on the following initiatives 

 revenues 

clearing and transaction fees  a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for exchangetraded and cleared swaps contracts because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenues 

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts fee limits and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

product mix we offer exchangetraded futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearedonly swap contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy metals and credit default rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products 

venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a 

 32 

clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions privately negotiated transactions include block trades which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on cme globex or the trading floor privately negotiated transactions also include volume submitted through cme clearport 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services access and communication fees and various services related to our exchange and building operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through thirdparty distributors 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotations trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

access and communication fees access and communication fees are charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services our communication services include our colocation program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform our colocation services were launched in january 2012 access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers 

other revenues other revenues include fees for administrating our interest earning facility ief program trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships and other services to members and clearing firms we offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various ief offerings these clearing firms receive interest income and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit 

to further diversify the range of services we offer we have entered into processing and development agreements with other exchanges and service organizations for example we have an agreement with bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa to develop a new multiasset class electronic trading platform for their customers we recognized revenue under this agreement as services were provided and when developed technology was delivered 

in addition other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by gfx corporation gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that trades futures contracts in a fully hedged book to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for certain products lastly other revenues include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants 

expenses 

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume however licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity contract and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year 

 33 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to stock options restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices the fair value of options is derived using the blackscholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility the riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options granted 

professional fees and outside services  this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives and legal proceedings 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements furniture fixtures and equipment this expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

other expenses we incur amortization of intangible assets and additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include noncore investing and financing activities 

  34 

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value 

 for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 19 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangibles assets relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of 

 35 

the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 

revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing houses clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests 

income taxes  calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs  certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally three years amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard on revenue recognition that replaces numerous industryspecific requirements and converges us accounting with international financial reporting standards the new standard introduces a framework for recognizing revenue that focuses on the transfer of control rather than risks and rewards the new standard also requires significant additional disclosures about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract the new standard will become effective in the first annual period beginning after december 15 2016 this guidance may be adopted using one of two transition methods which we are still evaluating along with the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

financial highlights 

the comparability of our operating results for the periods presented may be impacted by mergers acquisitions and disposals of businesses andor asset groups where material these impacts are discussed in the analysis that follows 

 36 

the following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented 



nm not meaningful 

revenues 



clearing and transaction fees 

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain clearedonly contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume volume and average rate per contract disclosures exclude our trakrs credit default swaps interest rate swaps cmece and cme europe contracts unless otherwise noted the following tables also exclude volumes for kcbt prior to january 1 2013 



we estimate the following increases decreases in clearing and transaction fees based on change in total contract volume and change in average rate per contract during 2014  compared with 2013  and during 2013  compared with 2012  



average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure including volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation 

 37 

clearing and transaction fees as presented on the consolidated statements of income include revenues for our clearedonly cme interest rate swap and cme credit default swap contracts in 2014 2013 and 2012 clearing and transaction fees generated from these contracts was 595 million 323 million and 61 million respectively the increase in revenue was largely attributable to increases in cme interest rate swap contract volume resulting from the overthecounter clearing mandate required to be implemented in 2013 by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume contract volume can be influenced by many factors including political and economic factors the regulatory environment and market competition 



1 the agricultural commodity product line does not   include the agricultural commodity contract volume for kcbt in 2012 the average daily volume for kcbts agricultural commodity contracts was 16100 during december 2012 

2 privately negotiated average daily volume includes both traditional block trades offexchange trades which were historically categorized as cme clearport now executed as futures block trades and exchange for related positions efrps 

interest rate products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years   



overall interest rate volumes increased in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to an increase in volumes for us treasury contracts and eurodollar futures and options contracts particularly with shortterm contracts we believe the growth was a result of increased volatility driven by changing expectations regarding nearterm federal reserve actions in addition we believe the growth in eurodollar options volume was attributable to increased sales efforts despite overall increases in interest rate volumes treasury bond volumes decreased in 2014 compared with 2013 us treasury volumes were high in the first half 

 38 

of 2013 due to short periods of high volatility created by the federal reserves activities with respect to its quantitative easing program 

in 2013 when compared with 2012 overall interest rate contract volume increased largely due to an increase in volume for the eurodollar back 32 futures as well as the 5year and 10year us treasury contracts the increase in volume resulted from periods of high volatility in 2013 particularly in mid and longterm interest rates we believe the periods of mid and longterm interest rate volatility were attributable to changes in market expectations regarding the federal reserves intention to revisit its quantitative easing strategy and to outline an exit strategy from its plan as well as a change in expectations regarding the federal reserves continued zero interest rate policy 

shortterm interest rate volatility remained low in 2013 compared with prior periods due to the federal reserves ongoing zero interest rate policy the federal reserves announcement in may 2013 that tapering might have occurred in 2013 resulted in an increase in shortterm interest rate volatility which contributed to a slight increase in eurodollar front 8 and eurodollar options contracts in 2013 compared with 2012 the federal reserves announcement had little effect on the 2year treasury volumes as market participants continued to focus primarily on midterm contracts such as the 5year and 10year treasury contracts 

equity products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity products 



we believe the increase in overall equity contract volume resulted from geopolitical events in russia and ukraine as well as the middle east that led to periods of relatively high volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index in the third quarter of 2014 we believe the increase in volume was also due to a more gradual increase in broad market volatility during the second half of 2014 caused by uncertainty surrounding interest rates and other geopolitical uncertainty the increase in the emini nasdaq100 contract volume was due to market participants shifting attention to the nasdaq100 index which had slightly higher volatility than the sp 500 throughout most of the year 

equity contract volume increased in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to periods of higher volatility in early 2013 we believe higher volatility resulted from changes in market expectations regarding the federal reserves intention to revisit its quantitative easing strategy we also believe the increase in equity contract volume in 2013 was due to a greater need for equity index futures and options contracts resulting from an increase in assets under management in equitybased funds the emini nasdaq contracts did not benefit from macrolevel events or increased general market volatility to the same extent as the emini sp 500 because the emini nasdaq contract hedges different market risks than the emini sp 500 

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products 



in 2014 when compared with 2013 the overall decrease in foreign exchange contract volumes was attributable to a decrease in exchange rate volatility across all major currencies we believe subdued expectations regarding interest rate changes across european countries and japan led to a decrease in exchange rate volatility throughout these regions additionally we believe allegations regarding possible collusion by certain foreign exchange market participants in other marketplaces had a continued negative impact on overall global foreign exchange product trading during 2014 despite the overall decline in volume for the year volume did improve during the second half of 2014 largely due to volatility created by global economic uncertainty and geopolitical risk 

 39 

the overall increase in foreign exchange contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to an increase in japanese yen and british pound contract volumes the increase in japanese yen contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was largely due to higher volatility resulting from reduced efforts by the japanese central bank to control yen exchange rates in early 2013 in addition we believe increased volatility and economic uncertainty within great britain in 2013 contributed to an overall increase in british pound contract volumes in 2013 when compared with 2012 as a result of a decrease in demand for commodity resources in china because of an economic slowdown in the chinese market demand decreased for currencies from countries that heavily depend on raw material exports such as the australian dollar and the canadian dollar we believe the decrease in demand for these currencies resulted in a decrease in volume for the austrian dollar and canadian dollar contracts additionally euro contract volume decreased due to lower volatility when compared with 2012 as a result of concerns related to the european credit crisis in 2012 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products 



1 the 2012 wheat contract volume does not   include volume for kcbts hard red winter wheat products the average daily volume for kcbts agricultural commodity contracts was 16100 during december 2012 

agricultural commodity contract volume increased in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to higher wheat contract volume in 2014 which we believe was caused by geopolitical concerns in russia and ukraine substantial increases in the production of corn and soybeans in 2014 encouraged hedgers to more aggressively seek protection against falling prices which we believe resulted in an increase in volume 

we believe the overall decline in total agricultural commodity contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to fewer weatherrelated events in 2013 which resulted in higher grain supplies and movement toward a more normal historical supply and demand environment the overall decrease in agricultural commodity volume was partially offset by incremental wheat contract volume from the addition of kcbts hard red winter wheat contract to our product line 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products 



total energy contract volumes decreased slightly in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to a decline in natural gas contract volume which we believe was attributable to low overall price levels resulting from increasing us energy production crude oil volume increased in 2014 particularly in the fourth quarter due to a shift in supply and demand which resulted in high volatility within the oil markets 

overall energy contract volumes remained flat in 2013 when compared with 2012 we believe crude oil contract volume increased due to improvements in distribution infrastructure we believe that revisions to our trading volume incentives program also contributed to an increase in crude oil contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 the decline in natural gas contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to lower volatility due to an increase in domestic supplies above forecasted amounts additionally natural gas contract volume declined in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to lower volatility caused by fewer weatherrelated events in early 2013 the decline in refined products contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was due to a decrease in demand in the underlying physical market 

 40 

metal products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products 



we believe overall metal contract volumes decreased in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to lower price volatility prices remained stable due to a strengthening us dollar and the expectation of an increase in us interest rates in addition demand for gold continued to slow due to lower economic growth rates in india and china which are both large consumers of gold 

total metal contract volume increased in 2013 when compared with 2012 we believe the increase in metal contract volume was driven by periods of high price volatility caused by significant changes in macroeconomic market conditions and market sentiment toward gold and silver products improving economic conditions in the us the federal reserves stimulus policy as well as a change in demand in the asian markets contributed to an increase in copper contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 

average rate per contract 

the average rate per contract decreased in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to a shift in the relative mix of product volume interest rate product volume when measured as a percentage of total volume increased by 4 percentage points in 2014 while all other product lines decreased interest rate contracts have a lower average rate per contract compared with other product lines in addition an increase in incentives and discounts on our energy contracts also resulted in a decrease in the average rate per contract in 2014 when compared with 2013 

the decrease in average rate per contract in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to a shift in the relative mix of product volume in 2013 interest rate product volume when measured as a percentage of total volume increased by 5 percentage points while agricultural commodity product volume decreased by 2 percentage points and equity and energy product volumes decreased by 1 percentage point each when compared with 2012 in addition the decrease in average rate per contract in 2013 when compared with 2012 resulted from an increase in incentives and discounts on our energy contracts 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2014 one firm represented 11  and one firm represented 10  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2013  two firms each represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2012  should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm 

other sources of revenue 

market data and information services the increase in market data and information services revenues in 2014 when compared with 2013 was attributable to a 15 fee increase per device for basic realtime market data services at the beginning of 2014 the decline in market data and information services revenue in 2013 when compared with 2012 resulted from a decrease in market data and information services revenues from the dji asset group and cma in the second quarter of 2012 the dji asset group including assets which generated market data and information services revenue was contributed to the mcgraw venture and cma was sold to mcgraw in addition declines in the basic device count from 2012 to 2014 were due to costcutting initiatives at customer firms as well as continued utilization of a legacy incentive program partially offset the increase in 2014 when compared with 2013 and contributed to the decrease in 2013 when compared with 2012 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented in aggregate 44  52  and 43  of our market data and information services revenue in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 

 41 

access and communication fees  we launched our colocation services in january 2012 the decreases in revenues from 2012 through 2014 were attributable to a decrease in other connection charges from customers who migrated over to our colocation program the overall decrease in 2014 when compared with 2013 was partially offset by an increase in revenues from our colocation program due to existing customers migrating from other connections in 2013 when compared with 2012 revenue generated from our colocation program decreased due to modifications to space and power requirements by customers during the first contract renewal period in early 2013 

other revenue in 2014 we recognized 19 million in fees earned under our technology agreement with bmfbovespa sa compared with 87 million in fees in 2013 in 2013 we also recognized 51 million of insurance proceeds related to hurricane sandy these events contributed to the decrease in other revenues in 2014 when compared with 2013 and the increase in other revenues in 2013 when compared with 2012 in addition we sold the nymex building in the fourth quarter of 2013 and two cbot buildings in april 2012 which resulted in decreases in rental income from 2012 through 2014 

expenses 



2014 compared with 2013 

operating expenses increased by 448 million  in 2014 when compared with 2013 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase in operating expenses 



operating expenses increased in 2014 when compared with 2013 due to the following reasons 

  42 

assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies we expect to continue to incur gains and losses from exchange rate fluctuations as long as we maintain those cash balances 

 increases in overall operating expenses in 2014 when compared with 2013 where partially offset by the following decreases 

 2013 compared with 2012 

operating expenses increased by 767 million  in 2013 when compared with 2012 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase in operating expenses 



overall operating expenses increased in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to the following reasons 

  43 

the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in expenses due to the contribution of the dji asset group and the sale of cma to mcgraw in june 2012 reduced ongoing expenses resulting from the contribution of the dji asset group and the sale of cma included compensation and benefits professional fees and outside services amortization of purchased intangibles as well as other expenses 

nonoperating income expense

investment income the overall decrease in investment income in 2014 when compared with 2013 was largely due to decreases in dividend income and a reduced gain on marketable securities related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan gains and losses from securities in the nonqualified deferred compensation plan are offset by an equal amount of compensation and benefits expense the decrease was partially offset by an increase in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that are reinvested the increase in cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions was due to an increase in open interest as well as a shift in clearing firm collateral preferences towards cash 

investment income increased in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to an increase in gains on marketable securities related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan 

interest and other borrowing costs  the following table shows the weighted average borrowings outstanding weighted average effective yield and average cost of borrowing for the periods presented 



1 average cost of borrowing includes interest the effective portion of interest rate hedges discount accretion and debt issuance costs commitment fees on line of credit agreements are not included in the average cost of borrowing 

in the first quarter of 2014 we repaid the 575 fixed rate notes due february 2014 in the third quarter of 2013 we repaid 7500 million of 54 fixed rate notes due august 2013 and issued 7500 million of 53 fixed rate notes due september 2043 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that resulted in an effective interest rate of 473 on the 53 fixed rate notes due september 2043 these factors contributed to a decrease in weighted average borrowings outstanding in 2014 when compared with 2013 and an increase in weighted average borrowings outstanding in 2013 when compared with 2012 these factors also contributed to overall decreases in weighted average effective yield and average cost of borrowing from 2012 through 2014 

interest and other borrowing costs also include commitment fees on our line of credit agreements commitment fees increased from 2012 to 2014 due to increases in line of credit facilities in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the fourth quarter of 2012 to meet increased regulatory and business requirements 

equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries higher income generated from our spdji business venture contributed to increases in equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries from 2012 through 2014 

other income expense in 2012 we recognized a net gain of 589 million related to the contribution of the dji asset group and the sale of cma additionally in 2012 we recognized a gain of 57 million related to the recovery of a 2008 impairment loss on a corporate debt security held in the nymex securities lending portfolio

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 



the overall effective tax rate in 2014 compared with 2013 decreased due to lower deferred income tax expense related to changes in estimates of state and local apportionment factors as well as benefits related to settlements from state and local audits we also continued to recognize a benefit for the domestic productions activity deduction in 2014 however the benefits for the domestic production activities recognized in 2014 were lower than the benefits recognized in 2013 because the benefits recognized in 2013 included the impact of refunds claimed for 2008 through 2013 

in 2013 we recognized a benefit for the domestic production activities for 2008 through 2013 which contributed to a decrease in the effective tax rate in 2013 when compared with 2012 the decrease was partially offset by increases in reserves for uncertain tax positions and increases in the deferred income tax expense resulting from a change in state and local apportionment factors in the third quarter of 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

we have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations while our cost structure is fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments however it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2014  these were as follows 

  

 operating leases include rent payments for office space in chicago new york and other smaller offices in the united states and in various foreign countries the operating lease for our headquarters in chicago expires in november 2022 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 116 million  to 135 million  we also maintain operating leases for additional office spaces in chicago which expire in november 2023 and april 2027 annual minimum rental payments under these leases range from 54 million  to 62 million  and 31 million to 43 million respectively the operating lease for our office space in new york expires in december 2028 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 131 million to 247 million 

purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to purchase software licenses hardware advertising and maintenance as well as telecommunication services debt obligations include repayment of principal and interest associated with the debt obligations other longterm liabilities include funding obligations for other postretirement benefit plans as well as contingent consideration 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through additional investment in our colocation program increased system capacity performance improvements as well as improvements to some of our office spaces each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data 

 45 

centers telecommunications network and other operating equipment in 2015  we expect capital expenditures to total approximately 1500 million  we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders which remains at approximately 50 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant cme group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends on february 4 2015  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 050  per share the dividend will be payable on march 25 2015  to shareholders of record on march 10 2015  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately 1680 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 200 per share on december 10 2014 paid on january 13 2015 to the shareholders of record on december 29 2014 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

sources and uses of cash 

the following is a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



nm not meaningful 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities remained relatively flat in 2014 when compared with 2013 an increase in cash provided by operating activities due to increased volume was offset by a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities resulting from higher payments of accrued expenses in 2014 when compared with 2013 we paid a higher bonus in 2014 when compared with the bonus payment in 2013 additionally we had higher payments in 2014 for legal and other consulting services primarily related to remediation efforts for an information security breach that occurred in 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities increased slightly in 2013 when compared with 2012 net cash provided by operating activities was lower in 2012 due to an additional cash contribution to the cmece guaranty fund in 2012 cash contributed to the guaranty fund is considered restricted and was transferred from cash and cash equivalents to other assets when contributed 

investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2014 when compared with 2013 and the increase in cash provided by investing activities in 2013 when compared with 2012 were due largely to proceeds from the sale of a building in new york and the settlement of a derivative contract related to our debt offering in 2013 in addition there were additional investments in business ventures in 2014 and 2012 which contributed to the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2014 when compared with 2013 and an increase in cash provided by investing activities in 2013 when compared with 2012 this increase in 2013 when compared with 2012 was partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of two building properties in april 2012 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was higher in 2014 when compared with 2013 the increase in cash used was attributable to an increase in cash dividends of  09 billion  in 2014 when compared with 2013 the annual variable dividend from 2013 operations was paid in the first quarter of 2014 the annual variable dividend from 2012 operations was paid in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to uncertainty surrounding dividend income tax treatment beginning in 2013 the increase in cash used was also due to the repayment of the fixed rate notes due february 2014 

cash used in financing activities was higher in 2013 when compared with 2012 the increase was attributable to the repayment of the fixed rate notes due august 2013 the increase in net cash used in financing activities was also due to our purchase of the noncontrolling interest the dji asset group from dow jones in the second quarter of 2013 the increase in cash used in 

 46 

financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in cash dividends of 06 billion  in 2013 when compared with the same period in 2012 there were two annual dividends paid in 2012 including the annual variable dividend from 2011 operations and the annual variable dividend from 2012 operations 

debt instruments 

the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2014  

  

 we maintain a 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions which matures in january 2016 the proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes which includes providing liquidity for our cme clearing house in certain circumstances at cme groups discretion and if necessary for maturities of commercial paper as long as we are not in default under this facility we have the option to increase it up to 25 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds this facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty under this facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test which is defined as our consolidated shareholders equity at september 30 2012 giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements and in no event greater than 20 billion in aggregate multiplied by 065 we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility 

we maintain a 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our cme clearing house the facility provides for borrowings of up to 70 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian for our collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms cme clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or us treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility at december 31 2014  guaranty fund collateral available was 66 billion  we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion in addition to the 364day facility we also have the option to use the 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing houses in the unlikely event of default in certain circumstances in addition our 364day facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as cme consolidated shareholders equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 8000 million we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility and our 364day multicurrency revolving secured credit facility for 70 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

at december 31 2014  we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 18 billion under our multicurrency revolving senior credit facilities 

at december 31 2014  we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities

the following table summarizes our credit ratings as of december 31 2014  



given our cash flow generation our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities if necessary we expect to maintain an investment grade rating if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2014  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the securities and exchange commission 

liquidity and cash management 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 14 billion  at december 31 2014  and 25 billion  at december 31 2013  the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices a majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in us treasury securities or us government agency securities our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that a 218 million  contribution in 2015  will allow us to meet our funding goal however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2015  and the december 31 2015  discount rate

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2014  consisted of fixedrate borrowings of 21 billion  changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixedrate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows we did not have any variablerate borrowings at december 31 2014  

credit risk 

our clearing houses act as the counterparties to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through thirdparty exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for exchangetraded and swaps products including interest rate swaps and credit default 

 48 

swaps for cme and cmece clearing firms we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk we establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity we marktomarket open positions of cme and cmece clearing firms at least once a day twice a day for futures and options contracts and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value we have the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant these practices allow our clearing houses to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity 

despite our safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

cme clearing 

we maintain three separate financial safeguard packages for cme clearing member firms 

 in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit 

we maintain a 70 billion 364day multicurrency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or us treasury securities performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day multicurrency line of credit we also have the option to use our 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing houses in the unlikely event of default 

at december 31 2014 aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for all three cme financial safeguard packages was 1351 billion  including 387 billion  of cash performance bond deposits and 24 billion  of letters of credit a defaulting firms performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm

cmece 

we maintain a financial safeguard package for cmece commodity and foreign exchange clearing firms in the unlikely event of default by a cmece clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations these assets include the defaulting firms performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions thereafter if the default remains unsatisfied after first applying assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation we would use guaranty fund contributions of 570 million from cmece funds clearing firms contributed to the commodity and foreign exchange guaranty fund in 2014 which totaled 100 million at december 31 2014  we would use at least 200 million of cmece funds in addition to the clearing firms guaranty fund contributions in the event of a default of a commodity or foreign exchange clearing firm 

we also maintain a separate financial safeguard package for cmece interest rate swap clearing firms in the unlikely event of default by a cmece clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations these assets include the defaulting firms performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions if the default remains unsatisfied we would apply guaranty fund contributions of 505 million that will be contributed by cmece each of the interest rate swap clearing firms contributed to the interest rate swap guaranty fund in 2014 which totaled 1011 million at december 31 2014  

aggregate cash performance bond deposits for cmece clearing firms for the commodity clearing firms and interest rate swap clearing firms were 153 million  at december 31 2014  there were no noncash performance bonds on deposit at december 31 2014  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on british pound cash balances held at subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result when subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency hold cash as well as certain other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies during 2014 the exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar fluctuated from a high of 171 per pound to a low of 156 per pound aggregate transaction gains losses for 2014  2013  and 2012  were 154 million 54 million and 47 million respectively we expect the foreign currency gainloss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold cash as well as certain assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets and liabilities we report in our consolidated balance sheets the financial statements of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in various currencies and are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income aggregate translation gains losses net of tax for 2014  2013  and 2012  were 31 million  05 million  and 109 million  respectively 

foreign currency risk related to equity investments 

we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain equity investments as discussed in the equity price risk section below 

foreign currency exchange risk related to customer collateral 

a portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in foreign currency we marktomarket all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price therefore our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results 

equity price risk 

we hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded at their fair value fair values for publicly traded equity investments are based on quoted market prices fair values are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value fluctuations in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions

 5 

highly liquid markets — our listed futures markets provide an effective forum for our customers to manage their risk and meet their investment needs relating to our markets we believe that our customers choose to trade on our centralized market due to its liquidity and price transparency market liquidity — or the ability of a market to absorb the execution of large purchases or sales quickly and efficiently whereby the market recovers quickly following the execution of large orders — is key to attracting customers and contributing to a markets success 

most diverse product line — our products provide a means for hedging speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with among other things interest rate sensitive instruments equity ownership changes in the value of foreign currency credit risk and changes in the prices of agricultural energy and metal commodities the estimated percentage of clearing and transaction fees revenue contributed by each product line is as follows   

we believe that the breadth and diversity of our product lines and the variety of their underlying contracts is beneficial to our overall performance when an individual product line or individual product is impacted by macroeconomic factors additionally our asset classes contain various products designed to address differing risk management needs and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing houses 

our products are traded through the cme globex electronic trading platform our open outcry auction markets in chicago and new york city and through privately negotiated transactions that we clear the estimated percentage of clearing and transaction fees revenue contributed by each trading venue is as follows 



1 privately negotiated venue average daily volume includes both traditional block trades as well as what was historically categorized as cme clearport 

our products generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity we distribute our market data over the cme market data platform directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets as well as to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with data from other exchanges other thirdparty data providers and news sources and then resell their consolidated data the estimated contributions of our market data and information services products excluding our index market data offerings based on percentage of total revenue over the last three years were 11  in 2013  12  in 2012  and 10  in 2011

 7 

with our regional customers in both listed and overthecounter markets and will provide additional opportunities to our expanding nonus customer base 

expanding our existing customer base and enhancing our product and services offerings to meet its risk management needs — we plan to grow our business by targeting cross asset sales across client segments driving international sales and generating new client participation across all regions we have a long history of customer value and responsiveness and believe our products and services make us well positioned to help our customers adapt and comply with new regulations while enabling them to efficiently manage their risks with the ongoing implementation of regulatory reform we expect capital efficiencies and smooth transitions to centralized clearing to continue to be important for our global client base 

extending our capabilities and business in the overthecounter markets —  we provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the market for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing houses our overthecounter offerings provide participants the extensive counterparty credit risk reduction and transparency of our clearing services while preserving the prevailing execution processes technology platforms and business structures currently in use in the marketplace we offer clearing services for cleared overthecounter derivatives in interest rate swaps credit default swaps foreign exchange and commodities we continue to focus on new customer onboarding for swaps clearing services expanding our overthecounter product offerings and working with the buy and sellsides to meet their needs for realtime clearing risk management and data reporting as the marketplace moves from a compliance phase to an optimization phase in 2013 the three phases of the clearing mandate of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank were implemented in the united states during the year we cleared overthecounter transactions with a notional value of more than 153 trillion and open interest as of december 31 2013  was 91 trillion our cme clearport platform offers access to an array of clearing services with the capacity to clear and report transactions in multiple asset classes

patents trademarks and licenses 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we also own the copyright to a variety of materials those copyrights some of which are registered include printed and online publications websites advertisements educational material graphic presentations and other literature both textual and electronic we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks patents copyrights database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods 

we offer equity index futures and options on key benchmarks including sp nasdaq dow jones and nikkei indexes these products are listed by us subject to license agreements with the applicable owners of the indexes some of which are exclusive in connection with our joint venture with mcgrawhill we entered into a new license agreement sp license agreement which superseded our prior licensing arrangements and was assigned to the joint venture cme’s license for the sp 500 index will be exclusive for futures and options on futures until one year prior to the termination of the sp license agreement and nonexclusive for the last year the license for the other sp stock indexes is generally exclusive for futures and options on futures the term of the sp license agreement will continue until the later of i december 31 2017 or ii the date that is one year after the date that cme group ceases to own at least five percent accounting for dilution of the outstanding joint venture interests upon the occurrence of certain events including certain terminations of the joint venture the term may be extended up to an additional ten years cbot has an exclusive license agreement dow jones license agreement with cme group index services llc cme indexes for certain dow jones indexes which has also been assigned to the joint venture the initial term of the agreement is through june 30 2026 following the initial term the dow jones license agreement shall automatically renew for renewal terms of five years thereafter so long as there is open interest in any of cbot’s or its affiliates’ products based on one or more of the dow jones licensed indexes in the event there is no open interest in any such products then cme indexes has the ability to terminate the agreement we also have an exclusive license agreement for certain nasdaq indexes through 2019 copies of our sp dow jones and nasdaq license arrangements have been filed as material contracts we pay the applicable third party per trade fees based on contract volume under the terms of these licensing agreements

as a result of the wellpublicized issues relating to the credibility of the london interbank offered rate libor the uk treasury awarded nyse euronext now intercontinentalexchange group inc following its merger administration rights over the libor contract the transfer of the administration from the british bankers association bba was completed in early 2014 our preexisting license and membership agreement with the bba organization for the use of libor to settle several of our interest rate products including our eurodollar contract remains in effect following the transition 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with sp dow jones and nasdaq or be able to maintain our other existing licensing arrangements beyond the term of the current agreements in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments including securities and options based on the sp dow jones or nasdaq indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties also may succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond our jurisdictional reach andor our licensors 

seasonality 

generally we have historically experienced relatively higher contract volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower contract volume in the third and fourth quarters however such seasonality also may be impacted by general market conditions or other events during 2013  25  of our consolidated revenues were recognized in the first quarter 28  in the second quarter 24  in the third quarter and 23  in the fourth quarter 

working capital 

we generally meet our funding requirements with internally generated funds supplemented from time to time with public debt and commercial paper offerings for more information on our working capital needs see “managements discussion and analysis of operations and financial conditionliquidity and capital resources” beginning on page 31 which section is incorporated herein by reference 

customer base 

our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers governments and central banks our customers can connect to our cme globex electronic trading platform from access points across the globe customers may be members of one or more of our cme cbot nymex or comex exchanges rights to directly access our markets will depend upon the nature of the customer such as whether the individual is a member of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access 

trading rights and privileges are exchangespecific trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by our members membership on one of our futures exchanges also enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections in 2013  80  of our contract volume was conducted by our members and kcbt permit holders in connection with the transfer of kcbts operations to cbot in 2013 the rights of permit holders were extinguished 

the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represents charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 11  and one firm represented 10  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2013  in the event a clearing firm were to withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange 

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of changes in the financial services industry driven primarily by doddfrank 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 14 for a description of competitive risks and uncertainties 

competition in our derivatives business 

we believe competition in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others 

  9 

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality maintain liquidity and low transaction costs and implement customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers 

our competitors include among other entities exchanges such as intercontinentalexchange group inc ice group the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited and deutsche börse ag in addition competition in our industry is dynamic and recent developments and alliances may result in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business 

we also face competition from the overthecounter marketplace spot markets securities exchanges and other venues offering lookalike or close substitutes for our listed contracts 

in addition the development of swap execution facilities and the mandated trading andor clearing requirement for certain products may lead to the creation of platforms that promote competitive substitutes for our privately negotiated and exchangetraded products 

competition in our transaction processing business 

in addition we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with the continued implementation of and compliance with doddfrank 

our competitors in the clearing services space include among others companies such as ice group lchswapclear and deutsche börse ag in light of doddfranks clearing mandate and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe that other exchanges and infrastructure providers also may undertake to provide clearing services 

we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the fees charged for the services provided quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house timely delivery of the services reputation offering breadth confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the value of providing customers with capital efficiencies 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent actual and potential competitors because they have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities which could serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchange distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products although we may receive license fees for such products such fees may not exceed the impact of any loss in trading volume of our comparable product 

regulatory matters 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states and the united kingdom we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges and other businesses to offer our products and services to their citizens 

please also refer to the discussion below and in the “risk factors” section beginning on page 14 for a description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties 

regulation in the united states 

our operation of futures exchanges and our us clearing house is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc which requires that our exchange subsidiaries satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions 

 10 

of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years which is currently in process following the enactment of doddfrank the cftc has moved from a principlesbased to a more prescriptive regulatory approach over most aspects of our trading and clearing operations 

during 2013 the cftc the sec the department of treasury the board of governors of the federal reserve and other regulators continued to engage in extensive rulemaking to implement doddfrank over the past three years a number of regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to the implementation of mandatory clearing of certain overthecounter derivatives swap reporting operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting product definitions the definition of an agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets swap execution facilities and swap data repositories we continue to believe the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we continue to explore however portions of doddfrank remain subject to further rulemaking and such final regulations could include provisions that negatively impact our business 

our us clearing house has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility and a systemically important derivatives clearing organization these designations carry with them additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities by the federal reserve bank and the cftc 

our us swap data repository service and swap execution facility are also subject to the requirements of the commodity exchange act and the regulations of the cftc 

regulation in the united kingdom and the european union 

in the united kingdom the government approved a reorganization of its regulatory framework under which the financial services authority was dissolved and its oversight responsibilities were transitioned in 2013 primarily to the bank of england and the fca as a result in the united kingdom our operations are subject to multiple regulators the bank of england the fca and esma cme clearing our us clearing house will be subject to certain conditions and reporting obligations as a result of its recognition by esma the european union also is undergoing similar change establishing multiple supervisory authorities for financial services including esma multiple directives and regulations such as the amendments to markets in financial instruments directive mifid ii and changes to the markets in financial instruments regulation mifir the capital requirements regulations iv and the market abuse directive have been proposed with provisions similar to those contained in doddfrank 

key areas of focus 

we actively monitor and participate in the domestic and international rulemaking processes for our industry including providing government testimony commenting on proposed rulemakings and educating our regulators on potential impacts to the marketplace 

our key areas of focus in the regulatory environment are

financial information about geographic areas 

cme group has not historically tracked revenues based upon geographic location beginning in september 2011 we began tracking trading volume based on the country of origin of the transaction as disclosed to us by the customer prior to september 2011 we tracked trading volume based on the time of the execution of the trade and whether it occurred during traditional us trading hours or through our international telecommunication hubs 

in 2013 and 2012 we estimate that approximately 22 and 21 of our electronic trading volume originated from outside of the united states the following table shows the percentage of our total contract volume on our globex electronic trading platform generated during nonus hours and through our international hubs for the last three years

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market economic and political conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our contract volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially dependent on the contract volume in our markets our contract volume is directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

  14 

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however as evidenced by our past performance in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital the shifts in market trading patterns we experienced as a result of the financial disturbance of 2008 may or may not recur in the future and our business will be affected by future economic uncertainties which may result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

we are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory agencies in the united states and the united kingdom we also are subject to varying levels of regulation by foreign jurisdictions that permit our exchanges to offer our products and services to their citizens 

due to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 the united states and numerous other governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of debating or enacting new laws and regulations that will impact our business while certain of these changes may have a positive impact on our business some of these changes could adversely affect our business including areas of regulatory focus discussed under item 1 – business – regulatory matters beginning on page 10 compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources that could result in some participants leaving our markets or decreasing their trading activity which would negatively affect our profitability we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the extensive regulations that apply to our business to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of doddfrank and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

our clearing houses seek to offer customers intermediaries and clearing firms universal access in order to maximize the efficient use of capital exercise appropriate oversight of value at risk and maintain operating leverage from clearing activities our strategic business plan is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business some of our clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our revenues and profits could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete   our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry we believe portions of doddfrank and the corresponding regulations with respect to mandatory clearing and organized trading provide opportunities for our business however other portions of doddfrank and the regulatory structure being implemented could negatively impact our business and our ability to compete effectively we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and in some cases operating 

 15 

under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large industry participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do 

our competitors may 

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed a decline in our fees or loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

please see item 1 – business – competition beginning on page 9 for additional information on the competitive environment and its potential impact on our business 

our contract volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our contract volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution and clearing facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example in recent years some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies such as lowering the fees that they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity payments or rebates we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 11  and one firm represented 10  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2013  should a clearing firm withdraw our experience indicates that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange however there is the possibility we would lose a portion of the customer business additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our contract volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of contract volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected furthermore declines in contract volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of contract volume 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while we generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on private causes of actions in cases where we have not behaved in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated andor direct actions brought by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary 

 16 

losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction or that we failed to effectively carryout our regulatory oversight responsibilities dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks our networks and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and contract volume and result in substantial liabilities we also could be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems andor investigate any alleged attack 

we regard the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our networks and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism firewall or encryption failures and other security problems groups have targeted the financial services industry and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other information security risks in july 2013 we were the victim of a cyber intrusion although we maintain sophisticated systems teams and processes to prevent such incidents and took significant actions to address the incident we learned that certain customer information was compromised we incurred expenses of 160 million related to our response to the event any future alleged incidents could result in substantial costs and liability to us and diversions of our resources and may distract the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business 

additionally our role as a leading derivatives marketplace and the operation of our cme globex electronic trading platform may place us at greater risk for misappropriation of our intellectual property for example in 2012 a former employee of cme group pled guilty to theft of our trade secrets other persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 

as part of our global information security program we employ resources to monitor and protect our environment and infrastructure against such cyber attacks and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property assets however these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed which could result in system failures and delays loss of customers and lower contract volume and negatively affect our competitive advantage and result in substantial costs and liabilities 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business while we have undertaken significant measures to develop business continuity plans and to establish backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such attack may result in the closure of our trading and clearing facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 17 

risks relating to our business 

the success of our markets depends on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or our current or potential customers do not adopt it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is dominated by electronic trading 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our thirdparty providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market for 

 18 

example our colocation facility hosts a significant portion of our customers infrastructure while we have undertaken measures to secure such facility and to implement disaster recovery measures if we were to experience an outage at that location it could have a significant impact on our revenues and reputation 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak contract volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in contract volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future contract volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual contract volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex contract volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy our goal is to design our systems to handle two times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

we as well as many of our customers depend on thirdparty suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased contract volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of our third party clearing firms and consequently a diminishment in their financial resources could adversely affect us 

our clearing house operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles we routinely guarantee transactions submitted by our clearing firms with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers firms in the financial industry have experienced significant uncertainty and negative conditions as a result of the continued fallout from the financial crisis of 2008 we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one or more of our clearing firms 

as part of our growth initiatives we have expanded our clearing services to swaps in addition to standard futures and options on futures products the process for setting margins and establishing other financial safeguards for swaps differs from our historical practices although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and establishing 

 19 

financial safeguards for swaps there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect the clearing house in the event of a clearing member default during extreme market conditions 

while we have hired experienced management to oversee the operations of cme clearing europe established in 2011 as an organization we have limited experience operating a clearing house outside of the united states 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to the clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a fund currently up to 98 million to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to qualified family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances if their clearing firm member becomes insolvent 

the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market 

to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit collateral to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and foreign sovereign debt and subject them to established haircuts based on the type of collateral and maturity there is no guarantee the collateral will maintain its value to the extent a clearing firm is not compliant with capital margin or guaranty fund requirements it would be required to promptly come into compliance by adding capital or collateral decreasing its proprietary trading activity andor transferring customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products 

intellectual property rights licensed from third party price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue recent regulatory scrutiny into such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products 

we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from thirdparty price reporting agencies including our benchmark eurodollar contract which is based on libor to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily subject to manipulation our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenues 

our market data revenues may be reduced by decreased demand poor overall economic conditions or a significant change in how market participants trade and use market data 

we sell our market data to individuals trading institutions and other organizations that use our information services to participate in our markets andor monitor general economic conditions excluding our index market data offerings revenues from our market data and information services represented 11  and 12  of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively a decrease in overall contract volume may lead to a decreased demand for our market data for example in both 2013  and 2012  we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data devices due to the continued economic uncertainty continued high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms and legacy incentive programs tied to trading terminals in 2013 we announced a series of policy changes and price increases effective over 2014 and 2015 that should result in increased market data and information services revenue however we cannot guarantee that the changes or increased cost will not result in a reduction of the total number of paid subscriptions as users review their business needs for our services 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter market and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions other investments or strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

 20 

there is no guarantee that our overthecounter initiatives will be successful 

our goal is to provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the marketplace for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to our clearing houses we offer clearing services for cleared overthecounter derivatives including interest rate swaps credit default swaps foreign exchange and commodities our strategy also includes extending our overthecounter services into other asset classes as well as enhancing our cme clearport functionality to support additional products while we believe the implementation of doddfrank creates new opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter offerings the current regulatory environment for trading and clearing these products remains uncertain we cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably under the new legislation for example provisions within doddfrank include changes to the cftcs core principles specifically core principle 9 which could require us to make modifications to the manner in which certain of our contracts trade andor require that such products be delisted as futures and relisted as swaps also numerous capital changes and provisions in basel iii may result in uncleared bilateral overthecounter derivatives being less expensive than cleared derivatives in addition a number of market participants and exchanges have developed competing platforms and products including new swap execution facilities we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively or that our initiatives will be successful 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions other investments and strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of the increasing consolidation in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us to the extent the trend of consolidation in our industry continues we may encounter increased difficulties in identifying growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration also may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from growth initiatives we have made or will make in the future which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we also may be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively affect our stock price 

expansion of our global operations involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our global operations including through cme clearing europe the launch of cme europe our european trade repository directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 we cannot assure you that we will be successful in marketing our products and services in international markets we also may experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

 21 

our compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators raised during regulatory examinations or we may otherwise become subject to their inquiry and oversight the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business in 2013 the cftc filed suit against nymex and two former employees alleging disclosure of confidential customer information in violation of the commodity exchange act based on our initial review of the complaint we believe that we have strong factual and legal defenses to the claim 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees and agents including employees of gfx corporation our whollyowned subsidiary that engages in proprietary trading to generate liquidity could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example in 2012 a former employee of cme group pled guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and electronic execution services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

 22 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we might still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 29 billion  of total indebtedness of which 7500 million was paid down in february 2014 and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 18 billion  

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our us exchanges and clearing house also are required to maintain capital as defined by the cftc equal to at least twelve months of their applicable projected operating expenses 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the past we have experienced ratings downgrades our failure to maintain our ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital additionally if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase all of our fixedrate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

our investment in bmfbovespa subjects us to investment and currency risk 

we own an interest in bmfbovespa representing approximately 5 of its outstanding shares which had a fair value of 4731 million  as of december 31 2013  as an exchange its ability to maintain or expand its contract volume and operate its business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject additionally its stock is valued in brazilian real which subjects us to currency risk there is no guarantee that our investment in bmfbovespa will be profitable 

any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets or investments may result in material noncash writedowns and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity 

in connection with our acquisitions and investments including our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings we have recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by applying a fair value test looking at historical performance capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise in the past we have recorded impairment charges in connection with some of our investments including our investment in bmfbovespa we may continue to experience future events that result in impairments the risk of impairment losses may increase to the extent our market capitalization and earnings decline an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results and could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our existing or future debt agreements

our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

we have historically experienced relatively higher contract volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower contract volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure for example we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically than for trades executed on the trading floor in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability would be adversely affected 

seventeen of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their rights to elect directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

seventeen of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members in 2013  80  of our contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result members may not have the same economic interests as holders of our class a common stock in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their methods of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange also are entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to the operation of our open outcry trading facilities and certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

class b common stock 

our class b common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized overthecounter market each class of our class b common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our cme exchange cmes rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights each share of our class b common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights 

class b shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold or leased through our shareholder relations and membership services department although our class b shareholders have special voting rights because our class b shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our class a shares we expect that the market price of our class b common stock if reported separately from the associated trading rights would be determined by the value of our class a common stock   as of february 12 2014 there were approximately 1650  holders of record of our class b common stock 

dividends 

the following table sets forth the dividends we paid on our class a and class b common stock in the last two years 



we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders according to our annual dividend policy which remains at approximately 50 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to declare a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our future earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant on february 5 2014  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 047  per share the dividend will be payable on march 25 2014  to shareholders of record on march 10 2014  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the total first quarter dividend payment will be approximately 1569 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 260 per share on december 11 2013 paid on january 14 2014 to the shareholders of record on december 27 2013 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined at the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year the annual variable dividend related to 2012 operations was accelerated to the fourth quarter of 2012 due to uncertainty surrounding dividend income tax treatment beginning in 2013 

 26 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 364day clearing house credit facility for 70 billion and our 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

for example under our senior credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of september 30 2012 after giving effect to actual share repurchases made and special dividends paid including annual variable dividends but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid after september 30 2012 and in no event greater than 20 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends during the term of the agreement multiplied by 065 in addition our 364day clearing house credit facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 8000 million 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries including cme in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

cme group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of their state of incorporation which could also limit its or their ability to declare and pay dividends

overview 

business overview 

cme group a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for cme cbot nymex and their respective subsidiaries as well as cme clearing europe limited cmece the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme groups class a common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” 

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts we also clear futures options on futures and overthecounter contracts through our two clearing organizations cme clearing which is a division of cme and cmece futures contracts options on futures contracts and overthecounter contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals we also clear overthecounter contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates credit default foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals 

our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

 31 

most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our cme and cmece clearing houses 

our clearing houses clear settle and guarantee futures and options contract traded through our exchange in addition to cleared overthecounter products our clearing houses performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing houses as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies 

business trends 

economic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite recent economic uncertainty and volatility in recent years trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the united states and european credit crises fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the federal reserve bank’s continued zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment  our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of recent regulatory reforms in the financial services industry competition is influenced by liquidity and transparency of the markets transaction costs breadth of product offerings including quality of new product development as well as efficient and innovative technology and connectivity we believe we are very well situated with respect to these factors we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as markets continue to evolve we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers 

regulatory environment  exchangetraded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation as a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over recent years various domestic and foreign governments have undertaken reviews of the existing legal framework governing financial markets and have either passed new laws and regulations or are in the process of enacting new laws and regulations that will apply to our business compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability 

our futures exchanges and our us clearing house are subject to extensive regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc which carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act the commodity futures modernization act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank over the last three years a number of regulations to implement doddfrank were finalized while we believe that the new regulations will provide opportunities for our business the new regulations remain subject to additional rulemaking by various regulators in 2013 the cftc designated our us clearing house as a systemically important derivatives clearing organization which imposes various new procedural and substantive requirements we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the provisions of doddfrank and any new regulations 

as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign locations where we do business the financial services industry in europe has recently undergone regulatory reform and a reorganization of its regulatory framework our european operations are now subject to several regulators including the bank of england the financial conduct authority fca and the european securities market authority esma we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to comply with the new regulations in europe 

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on leveraging our benchmark products enhancing our customer relations expanding our customer base advancing our clearing and trading technologies and deriving benefits from our integrated clearing houses as well as our scalable infrastructure we focus specifically on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that 

 32 

provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes we believe that we can build on our competitive strengths by executing on the following initiatives 

 revenues 

clearing and transaction fees  a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privatelynegotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for exchangetraded and overthe counter contracts because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract or notional value basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenues 

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts limits on fees and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

product mix we offer exchangetraded futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearedonly contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy metals and credit default rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products 

venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions privately negotiated transactions include block trades which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on cme globex or the trading floor privately negotiated transactions also include volume from cme clearport 

 33 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services access and communication fees and various services related to our exchange and building operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through thirdparty distributors 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotations trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

access and communication fees access and communication fees are charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services our communication services include our colocation program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform our colocation services were launched in january 2012 access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers 

other revenues to further diversify the range of services we offer we have entered into processing and development agreements with other exchanges and service organizations for example we have an agreement with bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa to develop a new multiasset class electronic trading platform for their customers we recognize revenue under this agreement as services are provided and when developed technology is delivered 

other revenues also include fees for administrating our interest earning facility ief program trade order routing and various services to members and clearing firms we offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various ief offerings these clearing firms receive interest income and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit in addition other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by gfx corporation gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that trades futures contracts in a fully hedged book to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for certain products other revenues may also include gains on sales from operating assets lastly other revenues include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants 

expenses 

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume licensing and other fee agreements and the majority of our employee bonuses do vary directly with contract volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to stock options restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of options is derived using the blackscholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility the riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options granted the fair value of other awards is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices 

 34 

professional fees and outside services  this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives and legal proceedings 

amortization of purchased intangibles this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with cbot holdings inc and nymex holdings inc as well as other asset and business acquisitions intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm market data and other customer relationships 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements furniture fixtures and equipment this expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

other expenses we incur additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include noncore investing and financing activities 

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make 

 35 

certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value 

 for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 19 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangibles assets relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 

revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing houses clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is 

 36 

provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests 

income taxes  calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs  certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally three years amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use 

results of operations 

2013  financial highlights 

the comparability of our operating results for the periods presented may be impacted by mergers acquisitions and disposals of businesses andor asset groups where material these impacts are discussed in the analysis that follows 

the following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented 



nm not meaningful 

  37 

global bankruptcy resulting in a decrease in expenses in 2012 when compared with 2011 higher compensation and benefits expense partially offset the decrease in operating expenses in 2012 when compared with 2011 

 revenues 



clearing and transaction fees 

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain clearedonly contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume volume and average rate per contract disclosures exclude our cme interest rate swap cme credit default swap trakrs and cme clearing europe contracts unless otherwise noted the following tables also exclude volumes for kcbt prior to january 1 2013 



we estimate the following increases decreases in clearing and transaction fees based on change in total contract volume and change in average rate per contract during 2013  compared with 2012  and during 2012  compared with 2011  



average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure including volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation 

clearing and transaction fees include revenues for our clearedonly cme interest rate swap and cme credit default swap contracts in 2013 when compared with 2012 clearing and transaction fees generated from these contracts increased by 261 million the increase in revenue was largely attributable to an increase in cme interest rate swap contracts resulting from the 

 38 

overthecounter clearing mandate required to be implemented in 2013 by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume contract volume can be influenced by many factors including political and economic factors the regulatory environment and market competition 



1 the agricultural commodity product line does not   include the agricultural commodity contract volume for kcbt in 2012 the average daily volume for kcbts agricultural commodity contracts was 16100 during december 2012

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key interest rate products eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years   



in 2013 when compared with 2012 overall interest rate contract volume increased largely due to an increase in contract volume for the eurodollar back 32 futures as well as the 5year and 10year us treasury contracts the increase in volume resulted from periods of volatility in 2013 particularly in mid and longterm interest rates the periods of mid and longterm interest rate volatility were attributable to changes in market expectations regarding the federal reserves intention to revisit their quantitative easing strategy and to outline an exit strategy from their plan as well as a change in expectations regarding the federal reserves continued zero interest rate policy 

shortterm interest rate volatility remained low in 2013 compared with prior periods due to the federal reserves ongoing zero interest rate policy the federal reserves announcement in may 2013 that tapering may occur in 2013 resulted in an increase 

 39 

in shortterm interest rate volatility which contributed to a slight increase in eurodollar front 8 and eurodollar options contracts in 2013 compared with 2012 the federal reserves announcement had little effect on the 2year treasury volumes as market participants continued to focus primarily on midterm contracts such as the 5year and 10year treasury contracts 

overall interest rate contract volume decreased in 2012 when compared with 2011 due to low interest rate volatility as a result of the federal reserves continued intent to maintain its zero interest rate policy in 2012 when compared with 2011 the increase in volume in the longterm interest rate products including the eurodollar back 32 futures and the treasury bond futures and options contracts was attributable to periods of higher longterm interest rate volatility in early 2012 the federal reserves announcement in january 2012 to extend its zero interest rate policy shifted market expectations regarding longterm interest rates which resulted in periods of higher volatility in early 2012 

equity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key equity products 



overall equity contract volume increased in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to periods of higher volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index in early 2013 we believe higher volatility resulted from changes in market expectations regarding the federal reserves intention to revisit their quantitative easing strategy we also believe the increase in equity contract volume in 2013 was due to a greater need for equity index futures and options contracts resulting from an increase in assets under management in equitybased funds 

the decrease in overall equity contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was due to a decline in equity market volatility we believe the decline in volatility was the result of few new developments in the macroeconomic environment within the united states and european markets we also believe a decline in assets under management contributed to the decrease in volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 

in general equity products such as the emini nasdaq contracts that hedge market risks different than those of the emini sp 500 our most liquid equity product do not tend to benefit from macrolevel events or increased general market volatility to the same extent 

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key foreign exchange products 



the overall increase in foreign exchange contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to an increase in japanese yen and british pound contract volumes the increase in japanese yen contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was largely due to higher volatility resulting from reduced efforts by the japanese central bank to control yen exchange rates in early 2013 in addition increased volatility and economic uncertainty within great britain in 2013 contributed to an overall increase in british pound contract volumes in 2013 when compared with 2012 as a result of a decrease in demand for commodity resources in china because of an economic slowdown in the chinese market demand decreased for currencies from countries that heavily depend on raw material exports such as the australian dollar and the canadian dollar the decrease in demand for these currencies resulted in a decrease in volume for the austrian dollar and canadian dollar contracts additionally euro contract volume decreased due to lower volatility when compared with 2012 as a result of concerns related to the european credit crisis in 2012 

the overall decrease in foreign exchange contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was attributable largely to the decline in euro contract volume we believe trading activity in euro contracts was impacted by the lack of a directional trend in 

 40 

2012 due to uncertainty related to the health of the european union and concern regarding additional economic stimulus provided by the federal reserve the lack of a trend reduced trading in euro contracts among customers who trade based on medium to longterm expectations we believe the uncertainty with regard to the european union also contributed to a decline in british pound contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 because the british economy is closely tied to the european union we believe that intervention by the japanese central bank to control the yen foreign exchange rate beginning in mid2011 through 2012 caused market participants to reduce their trading in japanese yen contracts and to focus on higher yielding currencies such as the australian and canadian dollars 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products 



1 the 2012 wheat contract volume does not   include volume for kcbts hard red winter wheat products the average daily volume for kcbts agricultural commodity contracts was 16100 during december 2012 

the overall decline in total agricultural commodity contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to fewer weatherrelated events in 2013 which resulted in higher grain supplies and movement toward a more normal historical supply and demand environment the overall decrease in agricultural commodity volume was partially offset by incremental wheat contract volume from the addition of kcbts hard red winter wheat contract to our product line 

the increase in agricultural commodity contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was attributable to higher volatility resulting from severe drought conditions in the midwest and a very tight supply environment in mid2012 we believe the increased volatility was the result of supply constraint concerns for soybean and wheat supplies corn volumes declined slightly in 2012 when compared with 2011 early market expectations of excess supply in 2012 dampened corn price volatility in early 2012 which resulted in the decline in volume 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products 



overall energy contract volumes remained flat in 2013 when compared with 2012 an increase in crude oil contract volume was offset by a decrease in natural gas and refined products contract volume crude oil contract volume increased due to improvements in distribution infrastructure we believe that revisions to our trading volume incentives program also contributed to an increase in crude oil contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 the decline in natural gas contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to lower volatility due to an increase in domestic supplies above forecasted amounts additionally natural gas contract volume declined in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to lower price volatility caused by fewer weatherrelated events in early 2013 the decline in refined products contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 was due to a decrease in demand in the underlying physical market 

energy contract volume decreased slightly in 2012 when compared with 2011 a decline in crude oil contract volume resulting from lower price volatility contributed to an overall decrease in energy products volume political unrest in the middle east in the first quarter of 2011 resulted in changes in global supply which contributed to higher price volatility in early 2011 relative to 2012 additionally lower crude oil contract volume in 2012 was partially attributable to oversupply in cushing oklahoma the decrease in crude oil contract volume was partially offset by an increase in natural gas contract volume the increase in natural gas contract volume resulted largely from volatility around production shifts in the early part of 2012 refined products growth was due to increased volatility caused by a growing us export market as global oil markets adapted to increased supply of north american crude oil despite refinery shutdowns 

 41 

metal products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products 



total metal contract volume increased in 2013 when compared with 2012 the increase in metal contract volume was driven by periods of high price volatility caused by significant changes in macroeconomic market conditions and market sentiment toward gold and silver products improving economic conditions in the us the federal reserves stimulus policy as well as a change in demand in the asian markets contributed to an increase in copper contract volume in 2013 when compared with 2012 

the overall decrease in metal products volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was due to lower volatility in the precious metals markets in 2012 when compared with 2011 we believe the august 2011 announcement of the federal reserves intent to maintain its zero interest rate policy and deepening eurozone worries which caused high volatility within other financial markets in 2011 resulted in an increased interest in precious metals as an asset class this increased interest in 2011 resulted in relative decreases in gold and silver contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in volume for copper contracts as a result of economic growth in asia as well as global supply constraints 

average rate per contract 

the decrease in average rate per contract in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to a shift in the relative mix of product volume in 2013 interest rate product volume when measured as a percentage of total volume increased by 5  while agricultural commodity product volume decreased by 2  and equity and energy product volumes decreased by 1 each when compared with 2012 interest rate products have a lower average rate per contract compared with agricultural commodity equity and energy products in addition the decrease in average rate per contract in 2013 when compared with 2012 resulted from an increase in incentives and discounts on our energy contracts 

the average rate per contract increased in 2012 when compared with 2011 due to a shift in the relative mix of product volume in 2012 agricultural commodity and energy product volumes when measured as a percentage of total volume each increased by 2 while interest rate and equity product volumes decreased by 3 and 2 respectively agricultural commodity and energy products have higher fees compared with interest rate products and equity products 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 11  and one firm represented 10  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2013 two firms each represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2012  one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2011  should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm 

other sources of revenue 

market data and information services the declines in market data and information services revenues from 2011 to 2013 resulted from decreases in market data and information services revenues from the dji asset group and cma in june 2012 the dji asset group was contributed to spdji and cma was sold the dji asset group and cma generated market data revenues in addition the decreases in revenues were due to declines in the basic device count from 2011 to 2013 due to costcutting initiatives at customer firms as well as continued utilization of a legacy incentive program the decrease in market data and information services revenue in 2012 when compared with 2011 was partially offset by an increase in our basic device service fee from 61 per month to 70 per month effective january 2012 

effective january 1 2014 users of our basic realtime market data service will pay 85 per month for each device compared with 70 per month in 2013 and 2012 in addition we will not be granting any new market data fee waivers for terminals with trading capabilities beginning in 2014 existing users under the waiver will be charged 50 of the standard fee beginning in 2015 

 42 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented in aggregate 52  43  and 39  of our market data and information services revenue in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 

access and communication fees  we launched our colocation services in january 2012 the decrease in revenue in 2013 when compared with 2012 was attributable to a decrease in other connection charges from customers who migrated over to our colocation program revenue generated from our colocation program also decreased in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to modifications to space and power requirements by customers during the first contract renewal period in early 2013 our colocation program contributed to an increase in access and communication fees revenue in 2012 when compared with 2011 we generated incremental revenue of 478 million in 2012 when compared with 2011 

other revenue in 2013 when compared with 2012 the increase in other revenue was attributable to 88 million in fees recognized upon delivery of services under our technology agreement with bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa in the first quarter of 2013 the increase in other revenues was also attributable to 51 million of insurance proceeds from business interruption resulting from hurricane sandy which we received in the second quarter of 2013 the increase in other revenue in 2013 was partially offset by a 74 million decrease in rental income resulting from the sale of two cbot buildings in april 2012 we also sold the nymex building in november 2013 which will result in a decrease in future rental income 

in 2012 when compared with 2011 the decrease in other revenue was largely due to a decline in rental income of 131 million resulting from the sale of the cbot buildings in the second quarter of 2011 we recognized a 98 million gain on the sale of certain index services assets related to one of its service offerings which contributed to a decrease in other revenues in 2012 when compared with 2011 the initial phase to develop a new multiasset class electronic platform for bmfbovespa was completed in the third quarter of 2011 which also resulted in a decrease in other revenues in 2012 the decrease in other revenues in 2012 when compared with 2011 was partially offset by additional processing services revenue from various strategic relationships 

expenses 



 43 

2013 compared with 2012 

operating expenses increased by 767 million  in 2013 when compared with 2012 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase in operating expenses 



overall operating expenses increased in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to a rise in salaries benefits and employer taxes resulting from annual salary increases and rising healthcare costs an increase in average headcount due to efforts to expand and globalize our business also contributed to an increase in expenses in 2013 when compared with 2012 

in november 2013 cme group sold its building in new york the sale resulted in a loss on disposal of building assets a writeoff of leaserelated intangible assets and other transactionrelated costs 

bonus expense increased due to improved performance relative to our cash earnings target in 2013 when compared with 2012 performance relative to our 2012 cash earnings target 

an increase in licensing and other fee agreements resulted from higher volumes for interest rate swap products and certain equity contracts the increase in licensing and other fee agreements was also due to fees incurred in connection with a licensing agreement with spdji which was amended in the second quarter of 2012 

professional fees increased due to an increase in legal and other consulting services related to a security breach in 2013 

marketing expense increased due to new branding initiatives for cme group 

the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in expenses due to the contribution of the dji asset group and the sale of cma to mcgraw in june 2012 reduced ongoing expenses resulting from the contribution of the dji asset group and the sale of cma included compensation and benefits professional fees and outside services amortization of purchased intangibles as well as other expenses 

2012 compared with 2011 

operating expenses decreased by 369 million  in 2012 when compared with 2011 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the decrease in operating expenses 



in 2012 when compared with 2011 an increase in salaries benefits and employer taxes resulted from higher salaries and rising healthcare costs the increase was partially offset by a decrease in average headcount as a result of the contribution of the dji asset group and the sale of cma in the second quarter of 2012 

 44 

the increase in stockbased compensation expense was due to the accelerated vesting of stockbased compensation associated with our ceo transition in 2012 as well as the impact related to the september 2011 and 2012 grants 

an increase in our nonqualified deferred compensation liability the impact of which does not affect net income because of an equal and offsetting change in investment income contributed to an increase in compensation and benefits expense 

bonus expense decreased due to performance relative to our 2012 cash earnings target when compared with 2011 performance relative to our 2011 cash earnings target 

amortization of purchased intangibles declined as a result of the contribution of the dji asset group the sale of cma and the disposal of certain leaserelated intangible assets in the second quarter of 2012 

overall expenses also decreased in 2012 when compared with 2011 due to the expenses incurred in 2011 as a result of the mf global bankruptcy filing in the fourth quarter of 2011 which included writeoffs of accounts receivable legal fees and losses on collateral posted by gfx and held by mf global in customer segregated funds as well as other related expenses in 2012 we recognized a recovery on the losses incurred on collateral posted by gfx in 2011 

nonoperating income expense 



  

nm not meaningful 

investment income investment income increased in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to an increase in gains on marketable securities related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan of 43 million gains and losses from these nonqualified deferred compensation plan securities are offset by an equal amount of compensation and benefits expense 

the increase in investment income during 2012 when compared with 2011 was attributable to an increase in gains on marketable securities related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan of 57 million as well as other gains on investments the increase in investment income was partially offset by a decrease in dividend income of 59 million in 2012 compared with 2011 due largely to a decrease in dividends from our investment in bmfbovespa 

interest and other borrowing costs  the following table shows the weighted average borrowings outstanding weighted average effective yield and average cost of borrowing for the periods presented 



1 average cost of borrowing includes interest the effective portion of interest rate hedges discount accretion and debt issuance costs commitment fees on line of credit agreements are not included in the average cost of borrowing which is a change in presentation from prior years 

in september 2012 we issued 7500 million of 30 fixed rate notes due september 2022 in the third quarter of 2013 we repaid 7500 million of 54 fixed rate notes due august 2013 and issued 7500 million of 53 fixed rate notes due september 2043 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that resulted in an effective rate of 473 on the 53 fixed rate notes due september 2043 these factors contributed to increases in weighted average borrowings outstanding and decreases in weighted average effective yield from 2011 through 2013 the average cost of borrowing decreased in 2013 when compared with 2012 due to issuance of the fixed rate notes in september 2013 the average cost of borrowing decreased in 2012 when compared with 2011 due to the issuance of the fixed rate notes in september 2012 

 45 

interest and other borrowing costs also include commitment fees on our line of credit agreements commitment fees increased from 2011 to 2013 due to increases in line of credit facilities in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the fourth quarter of 2012 to meet increased regulatory and business requirements 

equity in net gains losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries we began recognizing income from our spdji business venture in the third quarter of 2012 income generated from this business venture contributed to increases in equity in net gains losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2012 and 2013 

other income expense in 2012 we recognized a net gain of 589 million related to the contribution of the dji asset group and the sale of cma additionally in 2012 we recognized a gain of 57 million related to the recovery of a 2008 impairment loss on a corporate debt security held in the nymex securities lending portfolio 

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 



in 2013 we recognized a benefit for the domestic production activities deduction which contributed to a decrease in the effective tax rate in 2013 when compared with 2012 the decrease was partially offset by increases in reserves for uncertain tax positions and increases in the deferred income tax expense resulting from a change in state and local apportionment factors in the third quarter of 2013 

in 2012 we established deferred income tax liabilities associated with the mcgraw venture resulting in an increase in our income tax provision which contributed to a higher effective tax rate in 2012 when compared with 2011 in 2011 we revalued our existing deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in state tax apportionment this revaluation contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate in 2012 when compared with 2011 additionally in the first quarter of 2011 we began marking to market our investment in bmfbovespa which resulted in a reduction in valuation allowances on unrealized capital losses previously reserved which also contributed to a higher effective tax rate in 2012 when compared with 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

we have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations while our cost structure is fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are dependent on contract volume levels we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments however it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013  these were as follows 

  

 operating leases include rent payments for office space in chicago new york and other smaller offices in the united states and in various foreign countries the operating lease for our headquarters in chicago expires in november 2022 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 113 million  to 135 million  we also maintain operating leases for 

 46 

additional office spaces in chicago which expire in november 2023 and april 2027 annual minimum rental payments under these leases range from 53 million  to 62 million  and 30 million to 43 million respectively the operating lease for our office space in new york expires in december 2028 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 131 million to 247 million 

purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to purchase software licenses hardware advertising and maintenance as well as telecommunication services debt obligations include repayment of the debt obligation as well as interest payments associated with the debt obligations other longterm liabilities include funding obligations for other postretirement benefit plans as well as contingent consideration 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through additional investment in our colocation program increased system capacity and performance improvements each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data centers telecommunications network and other operating equipment in 2014  we expect capital expenditures to total approximately 1750 million  we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders which remains at approximately 50 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to pay a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant cme group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends on february 5 2014  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 047  per share the dividend will be payable on march 25 2014  to shareholders of record on march 10 2014  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately 1569 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 260 per share on december 11 2013 paid on january 14 2014 to the shareholders of record on december 27 2013 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year the amount available for the annual variable dividend related to 2013 operations was favorably impacted by the proceeds from the sale of the nymex building in 2013 and by the proceeds from our interest rate swap settlement associated with our debt issuance in september 2013 

sources and uses of cash 

the following is a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities increased slightly in 2013 when compared with 2012 net cash provided by operating activities was lower in 2012 due to an additional cash contribution to the cmece guaranty fund in 2012 cash contributed to the guaranty fund is considered restricted and was transferred from cash and cash equivalents to other assets when contributed 

in 2012 when compared with 2011 net cash provided by operating activities decreased as a result of lower contract volumes 

investing activities 

the increase in cash provided by investing activities in 2013 when compared with 2012 was due largely to proceeds from the sale of a building in new york and the settlement of a derivative contract related to our debt offering in 2013 in addition there were additional investments in business ventures in 2012 this increase was partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of two building properties in april 2012 

cash used in investing activities in 2012 was higher than cash used in 2011 due to cash paid in business combinations and increased investment in business ventures partially offset by the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the two building properties in april 2012 

 47 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was higher in 2013 when compared with 2012 the increase was attributable to the repayment of the fixed rate notes due august 2013 the increase in net cash used in financing activities was also due to our purchase of the noncontrolling interest in cme group index holdings llc in the second quarter of 2013 the increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in cash dividends of 6252 million  in 2013 when compared with the same period in 2012 there were two annual dividends paid in 2012 including the annual variable dividend from 2011 operations and the annual variable dividend from 2012 operations which was accelerated to the fourth quarter of 2012 due to uncertainty surrounding dividend income tax treatment beginning in 2013 the annual variable dividend from 2013 operations was paid in the first quarter of 2014 

cash used in financing activities was lower in 2012 when compared with 2011 the decrease in cash used was attributable to the receipt of 7477 million in proceeds from debt issued in september 2012 in contrast with repayments of 4205 million of debt in the first quarter of 2011 in addition we repurchased 2204 million of class a common stock in 2011 the net decrease in cash used was partially offset by a 8515 million  increase in cash dividends paid in 2012 when compared with 2011 

debt instruments 

the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2013  

  

 we maintain a 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions the proceeds from the revolving senior credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes which includes providing liquidity for our cme clearing house in certain circumstances at cme groups discretion and if necessary for maturities of commercial paper as long as we are not in default under the senior credit facility we have the option to increase the facility up to 25 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds this senior credit facility matures in january 2016 the senior credit facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty under the credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test which is defined as our consolidated shareholders equity as of september 30 2012 giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements and in no event greater than 20 billion in aggregate multiplied by 065 we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility

 48 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility and our 364day multicurrency line of credit for 70 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

at december 31 2013  we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 18 billion under our multicurrency revolving senior credit facilities 

at december 31 2013  we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities

the following table summarizes our credit ratings as of december 31 2013  



given our cash flow generation our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities if necessary we expect to maintain an investment grade rating if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest

liquidity and cash management 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 25 billion  at december 31 2013  and 16 billion  at december 31 2012  the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices a majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in us treasury securities or us government agency securities our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that a 35 million  contribution in 2014  will allow us to meet our funding goal however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2014  and the december 31 2014  discount rate

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2013  consisted of fixed rate borrowings of 29 billion  changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixedrate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows we did not have any variable rate borrowings at december 31 2013  

credit risk 

our clearing houses act as the counterparties to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through thirdparty exchanges and overthecounter markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for exchangetraded and overthecounter products including interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for cme and cmece clearing firms we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk we establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity we marktomarket open positions of cme and cmece clearing firms at least once a day twice a day for futures and options contracts and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value we have the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant these practices allow our clearing houses to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity 

despite our safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

cme clearing 

we maintain three separate financial safeguard packages for cme clearing member firms 

 in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit 

we maintain a 70 billion 364day multicurrency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing we have the option to request an increase in the line from 70 billion to 100 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit pledged assets may 

 50 

include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash us treasury securities as well as select money market mutual funds approved for our interest earning facility ief program performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day multicurrency line of credit we also have the option to use our 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing houses in the unlikely event of default 

at december 31 2013 aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for all three cme financial safeguard packages was 1116 billion  including 200 billion  of cash performance bond deposits and 35 billion  of letters of credit a defaulting firms performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm 

the following shows the available assets at december 31 2013  in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets 



 

 the following shows the available assets for the interest rate swap financial safeguard package at december 31 2013  in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears interest rate swap contracts after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets

the following shows the available assets for the credit default swap financial safeguard package at december 31 2013  in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears credit default swap contracts after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets 

 

 cmece 

we maintain a financial safeguard package for cmece overthecounter commodity clearing firms in the unlikely event of default by a cmece clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations these assets include the defaulting firms performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions thereafter if the default remains unsatisfied after first applying assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation we would use guaranty fund contributions of 600 million of cmece funds for commodity clearing firms each of the commodity clearing firms began contributing to the commodity guaranty fund in 2013 which totaled 30 million at december 31 2013  once the cmece clearing firms fully contribute to the commodity guaranty fund in 2014 we would still use at least 200 million of cmece funds in addition to the clearing firms guaranty fund contributions in the event of a default of a commodity clearing firm 

we also maintain a separate financial safeguard package for cmece interest rate swap clearing firms in the unlikely event of default by a cmece clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations these assets include the defaulting firms performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions if the default remains unsatisfied we would apply guaranty fund contributions of 536 million that will be contributed by cmece each of the interest rate swap clearing firms began contributing to the interest rate swap guaranty fund in 2013 which totaled 1109 million at december 31 2013  

aggregate cash performance bond deposits for cmece clearing firms for the overthecounter commodity clearing firms and interest rate swap clearing firms were 638 million  at december 31 2013  there were no noncash performance bonds on deposit at december 31 2013  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

we have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on british pound cash balances held at subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result when subsidiaries with a us dollar functional currency hold cash as well as certain other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies during 2013 the exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar fluctuated from a high of 165 per pound to a low of 149 per pound we expect the foreign currency gainloss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold cash as well as certain assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets and liabilities we report in our consolidated balance sheets the financial statements of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in various currencies and are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other 

 52 

comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income aggregate translation gains losses net of tax for 2013  2012  and 2011  were 05 million  109 million  and 833 million  respectively in 2011 we began marking to market our investment in bmfbovespa as a result we reversed an unrealized loss of 817 million net of tax which was attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss upon recognizing impairment on our investment in bmfbovespa 

foreign currency risk related to equity investments 

we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain equity investments as discussed in the equity price risk section below 

foreign currency exchange risk related to customer collateral 

a portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in foreign currency we marktomarket all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price therefore our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results 

equity price risk 

we hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded at their fair value fair values for publiclytraded equity investments are based on quoted market prices fair values are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value fluctuations in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 

the table below summarizes equity investments that are subject to equity price fluctuations at december 31 2013  equity investments are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 



we do not currently hedge against equity price risk equity investments are assessed for otherthantemporary impairment on a quarterly basis

highly liquid markets — our listed futures markets provide an effective forum for our customers to manage their risk and meet their investment needs relating to our markets we believe that our customers choose to trade on our centralized market due to its liquidity and price transparency market liquidity — or the ability of a market to absorb the execution of large purchases or sales quickly and efficiently whereby the market recovers quickly following the execution of large orders — is key to attracting customers and contributing to a markets success 

most diverse product line — our products provide a means for hedging speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with among other things interest rate sensitive instruments equity ownership changes in the value of foreign currency credit risk and changes in the prices of agricultural energy and metal commodities the estimated percentage of clearing and transaction fees revenue contributed by each product line is as follows

following the wellpublicized issues relating to the credibility of the london interbank offered rate libor numerous investigations were undertaken by regulators and an official study of the benchmark was commissioned to evaluate potential reforms we currently have a licensing and membership agreement with bba enterprises limited and the british bankers association collectively bba for the use of libor to settle several of our interest rate products including our eurodollar contract for the license we paid an upfront fee and pay an annual fee based on the ongoing review of libor we expect libor to be reformed rather than replaced and to continue as a regulated benchmark depending upon the outcome of the reform efforts we may need to enter into a new license agreement with bba or the organization appointed to administer the benchmark 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with sp dow jones and nasdaq or be able to maintain our other existing licensing arrangements in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments including securities and options based on the sp dow jones or nasdaq indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond our jurisdictional reach andor our licensors 

seasonality 

generally we have historically experienced relatively higher contract volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower contract volume in the third and fourth quarters however such seasonality may also be impacted by general market conditions or other events during 2012  27  of our consolidated revenues were recognized in the first quarter 27  in the second quarter 23  in the third quarter and 23  in the fourth quarter 

working capital 

we generally meet our funding requirements with internally generated funds supplemented from time to time with public debt and commercial paper offerings for more information on our working capital needs see “managements discussion and analysis of operations and financial conditionliquidity and capital resources” beginning on page 50 which section is incorporated herein by reference 

customer base 

our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments our customers can access our cme globex trading platform across the globe customers may be members of one or more of our cme cbot nymex or comex exchanges or a permit holder at kcbt rights to directly access our markets will depend upon the nature of the customer such as whether the individual is a member or permit holder of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access 

trading rights and privileges are exchange specific trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by our members and permit holders membership on one of our futures exchanges or ownership of a kcbt permit also enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our memberspermit holders have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membershippermit holder benefit protections in 2012  79  of our contract volume was conducted by our members and permit holders 

the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers two firms each represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2012  in the event a clearing firm were to withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange in 2011 one of our largest clearing firms was placed into bankruptcy and we transferred all of their more than 30000 customer accounts to other futures commission merchants 

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry for example doddfrank gives the cftc authority to require certain swaps to be cleared by central clearing houses and to require certain of those swaps mandated for clearing to be traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities unless no exchange or swap execution facility makes the swap available for trading while these new requirements create opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter business a number of market participants and other exchanges and less regulated trading platforms have developed and likely will develop in the future competing platforms and products 

we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others 

competition in our derivatives business 

we believe competition in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 10 

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality maintain liquidity and low transaction costs and adopt additional customer protections designed to ensure the integrity of our market and the confidence of our customers 

our principal competitors include other exchanges such as nyse euronext nyse intercontinentalexchange inc ice the hong kong exchanges and clearing limited hkex and eurex group in addition recent industry developments and alliances such as the electronic liquidity exchange elx have resulted in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business we expect industry participants to continue to look for ways to grow their business despite the challenging regulatory environment for example in december 2012 nyse and ice entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which ice would acquire nyse hkex completed its acquisition of the london metal exchange in 2012 

we face competition from the overthecounter market with the trading of contracts similar to those traded or cleared on our exchanges such as swaps forward contracts and other exchange “lookalike” contracts in which parties directly negotiate the terms of their contracts as well as from spot markets exchangetraded funds contracts for difference and other substitutes for our products development of swap execution facilities and the mandated clearing requirement for certain products may create platforms that promote competitive substitutes for our privately negotiated and exchangetraded products we primarily face competition from the lchclearnet group in interest rate swaps and ice in credit default swaps 

competition in our transaction processing business 

in addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with the implementation of doddfrank which requires the mandatory central clearing of standardized overthecounter products 

ice has its own clearing operations which are comprised of regulated clearing houses across the united states europe and canada the options clearing corporation clears uslisted options and clears futures on a number of underlying financial assets including common stocks currencies and stock indexes new york portfolio clearing a clearing house created by nyse and the depository trust  clearing corporation dtcc clears interest rate futures contracts and crossmargins eligible positions against us treasury and agency securities and repurchase agreements cleared by dtccs subsidiary fixed income clearing corporation we believe that other exchanges may also undertake to provide clearing services especially in light of doddfranks clearing mandate 

we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the fees charged for the services provided quality and reliability of the services creditworthiness of the clearing house timely delivery of the services reputation offering breadth confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the value of providing customers with capital efficiencies 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent potential competitors because as purveyors of market data or trading software systems these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities as technology firms they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks additionally technology and software firms that develop trading systems hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets this may lead to decreased demand for our market data 

regulatory matters 

our operation of futures exchanges is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc under a principlesbased approach which requires that our exchange subsidiaries satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house but also as a result of recent regulations under a highly prescriptive regulatory regime the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act as amended by among others the commodity futures modernization act and doddfrank the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years and is scheduled for reconsideration in 2013 

in light of widespread financial and economic difficulties in the us and abroad particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 there were calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets doddfrank which was signed into law in 2010 is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchangetraded doddfrank reinforces the core tenets of our markets 

 since the adoption of doddfrank the cftc the sec the department of treasury and other regulators have engaged in extensive rulemaking to implement the legislation cme group and others in the industry continue to actively participate in the rulemaking process with the goal that the final regulations serve the public interest foster competition and innovation and do not place the us financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage in the evolving global financial markets over the past two years a number of regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to mandatory clearing and the operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting the definition of agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets while we continue to believe that the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we intend to explore a significant portion of the act however remains subject to further rulemaking and such final regulations could include provisions that negatively impact our business several congressional hearings have been held to evaluate the situation and various policy suggestions have been made to ensure the protection of customer segregated funds we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to make the necessary changes to our business to comply with the provisions of doddfrank and any new regulations stemming from these events 

our key areas of focus in the regulatory environment are 

 12 

pursuant to doddfrank in july 2012 the financial stability oversight council designated cme due its operation of our us clearing house as a systemically important financial market utility which carries with it additional regulatory oversight of certain of our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities 

in 2012 we began operating a registered swap data repository service that is subject to the oversight of the cftc and we must comply with certain core principles under the commodity exchange act 

as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to the laws and regulations in the locations in which we do business 

the financial services industry outside of the united states is also undergoing similar significant change particularly in europe for example in the united kingdom the government has proposed to reorganize its regulatory framework which would include the dissolution of the fsa with oversight to be transitioned in april 2013 to the bank of england the financial conduct authority and the prudential regulation authority depending upon the status of the regulated entity as a result in the united kingdom our operations could be subject to multiple regulators cme clearing europe limited our uk clearing house would be regulated by the bank of england cme europe limited our proposed uk exchange would be regulated by the financial conduct authority and cme our us clearing house would be regulated by the european securities and markets authority esma as an overseas clearing house the european union is also undergoing similar change with multiple supervisory authorities such as esma established in 2011 in addition to the national regulators esma has a supervisory and oversight role over european clearing houses noneuropean clearing houses noneuropean exchanges european trade repositories and noneuropean trade repositories providing services in europe multiple legislations such as the european market infrastructure regulation the markets in financial instruments directive the capital requirements directive iv and the market abuse directive have been proposed with provisions similar to those contained in doddfrank 

compliance with these new regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could result in some participants leaving our markets or decreasing their trading activity which would negatively affect our profitability to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of doddfrank and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

in 2012 notifications from one of our market data distributors made in accordance with the requirements of our market data license agreement included disclosures that such distributor had disseminated our market data to the government trading corporation gtc and to a european subsidiary of the national iranian oil company nioc in 2012 the gross revenues attributable to these indirect subscriptions made through the distributor were 3150 the terms and conditions on which the market data was disseminated by the distributor to gtc and nioc are the same as would be provided to any other indirect subscriber other than the execution of a uniform subscriber addendum that is made available to all of our distributors for use with their subscribers we do not have any contractual or other relationship with gtc or nioc we believe that the distribution of our market data which is otherwise publicly available in other forms on our web site on a realtime and delayed basis is exempt from applicable us sanctions programs pursuant to a statutory and regulatory exemption for exports of information and informational materials nevertheless we are in the process of requesting that our market data distributors refrain from providing our market data to their subscribers that are located in sanctioned countries or identified on the us treasury departments specially designated nationals and blocked persons list the distribution of our market data to gtc and nioc is subject to disclosure pursuant to section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 itrshr act and section 13r of the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act which requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports as applicable whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities transactions or dealings relating to iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction disclosure is required whether or not the activities are sanctionable under us law in connection with these disclosures we will be required to separately file concurrently with this annual report a notice that such activities have been disclosed in this report which notice must also contain the information required by section 13r of the exchange act 

there continues to be significant focus among the cftc sec and foreign regulators relating to perceived risks level playing field considerations and potential market abuses associated with algorithmic trading and high frequency trading following recent highly publicized technical problems including the 2010 “flash crash” and the significant losses incurred by knight capital although not clearly defined high frequency trading typically refers to professional traders acting in a proprietary capacity that engage in strategies that generate a large number of trades on a daily basis the cftc has formed a subcommittee to define high frequency trading within the context of automated trading systems determine the appropriateness 

of creating multiple categories for high frequency traders conduct an analysis of the oversight surveillance and economic aspects and identify potential market disruptions that could be provoked by such traders and possible mitigations we believe and there is considerable supporting evidence that high frequency traders play an important role in the marketplace by increasing liquidity narrowing spreads and enhancing the efficiency of markets at this time however it is unclear whether these inquires will result in restrictions on the use of high frequency trading 

in the united states and europe there are several proposals to tax financial transactions or to assess user fees for market participants for example in the united states there is discussion of assessing a user fee to fund the cftc and in europe legislative bodies are considering a tax on all financial transactions in the past efforts to implement a transaction tax or user fee have not been successful the implementation of additional costs to use our markets may discourage institutions and individuals from using our products to manage their risks which could adversely impact our contract volumes revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level a transaction tax or user fee in the us may also cause market participants to transition to andor increase their derivatives trading in jurisdictions outside the us which do not necessarily impose a comparable cost at this time 

in addition the us congress may propose to eliminate the favorable 6040 tax treatment for futures the current tax treatment for futures trading allows certain traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60 at capital gains rates and 40 at ordinary tax rates any repeal of 6040 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to our market participants who are most responsible for creating liquid and efficient markets

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks that we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market economic and political conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our contract volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially dependent on the contract volume in our markets our contract volume is directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically our trading volume has tended to increase during periods of heightened uncertainty due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however as evidenced by our performance in recent years in the period after a material market disturbance there may persist extreme uncertainties which may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure lower interest rates central bank asset purchase programs and lack of available capital during 2012 the us economy remained constrained due to uncertainty surrounding the presidential election the pending fiscal cliff and fears of global recession europe also continues to face uncertainty with some eurozone countries in recession as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful the shifts in market trading patterns experienced since the financial disturbance of 2008 may or may not persist and they will be affected by future economic uncertainties including the pending decisions regarding us spending central bank asset purchase activity and currency management policies around the world all of these uncertainties as well as new surprises may result in continued decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business and such environment is currently undergoing significant reform 

our business has been extensively regulated by the cftc in response to the economic crisis the doddfrank act was signed into law in 2010 this legislation is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchangetraded in accordance with doddfrank the cftcs authority has been significantly expanded to include overthecounter derivatives 

since the adoption of doddfrank the cftc the sec the department of treasury and other regulators have engaged in extensive rulemaking to implement the legislation cme group and others in the industry continue to actively participate in the rulemaking process with the goal that the final regulations serve the public interest foster competition and innovation and do not place the us financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage in our evolving global financial markets over the 

past two years a number of regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to mandatory clearing and the operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting the definition of agricultural commodity and certain provisions of the rules applicable to designated contract markets while we continue to believe that the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we intend to explore a significant portion of the act however remains subject to further rulemaking and such final regulations could include provisions that negatively impact our business including changes to core principle 9 

the implementation of basel iii and its one size fits all rules for capital charges as well as greater capital charges that will apply if we are not deemed a qualified central counterparty may impose overly burdensome capital requirements on our bankaffiliated clearing members and customers which could eliminate the incentives to trade liquid exchangetraded derivatives instead of other derivatives products with higher risk profiles the local rules implementing these international standards have not been finalized we will comply with cftc regulations that will be issued and therefore we expect to be deemed a qualified central counterparty when those regulations are effective however to the extent that we are not deemed a qualified central counterparty during the interim period or thereafter it could result in increased costs to our bankaffiliated clearing members and result in them electing to clear their business at another qualified central counterparty or imposing increased costs on customers that prefer to clear at cme 

additionally the futures industry its selfregulatory model and the segregation and customer protection regime are under scrutiny by the cftc and congress several congressional hearings have been held to evaluate the situation and various policy suggestions have been made to ensure the protection of customer segregated funds 

our operation of a registered swap data repository also subjects us to additional oversight of the cftc and we must comply with additional core principles relating to the operation of this newly formed regulated business 

as a global company with operations around the world we are also subject to the laws and regulations in the locations in which we do business we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations we also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by any of these regulatory agencies our subsidiaries cme clearing europe cme marketing europe and cme europe limited subject to obtaining fsa approval are also subject to the supervision and oversight of the fsa and in the future by the bank of england and the financial conduct authority which will replace the fsa the regulatory environment in the united kingdom and the european union is undergoing significant reforms in connection with the oversight of the financial services industry in response to the economic crisis a number of financial service legislations covering issues similar to those included in doddfrank have also been proposed in europe as we continue to expand our operations in the united kingdom with our uk clearing house and proposed uk exchange changes in the european including the uk regulatory environment will have a greater impact on our business 

compliance with these new regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could result in some participants leaving our markets or decreasing their trading activity which would negatively affect our profitability to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of doddfrank and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

in the united states and europe there are several proposals to tax financial transactions or to assess user fees for market participants for example in the united states there is a discussion of assessing a user fee to fund the cftc and in europe legislative bodies are considering a tax on all financial transactions in the past efforts to implement a transaction tax or user fee have not been successful the implementation of additional costs to use our markets may discourage institutions and individuals from using our products to manage their risks which could adversely impact our contract volumes revenues and profits and also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level a transaction tax or user fee in the us may also cause market participants to transition andor increase their derivatives trading in jurisdictions outside the us which do not necessarily impose a comparable cost at this time 

in addition the us congress may propose to eliminate the favorable 6040 tax treatment for futures the current tax treatment for futures trading allows certain traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60 at capital gains rates and 40 at ordinary tax rates any repeal of 6040 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to our market participants who are responsible for creating liquid and efficient markets 

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

some of our largest clearing firms which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with certain industry associations have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish or seek to use alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchanges even if they are not successful in their efforts the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets if any of these events occur our revenues and profits could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business will not survive 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry for example doddfrank gives the cftc authority to require certain swaps to be cleared by central clearing houses and to require certain of those swaps mandated for clearing to be traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities unless no exchange or swap execution facility makes the swap available for clearing while these new requirements create opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter business a number of market participants and other exchanges and less regulated trading platforms have developed and likely will develop in the future competing platforms and products 

we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources offering a wide range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants swap execution facilities alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others 

our principal competitors include other exchanges such as nyse ice hkex and eurex group in addition recent industry developments and alliances such as elx have resulted in a growing number of wellcapitalized trading service providers that compete with all or a portion of our business we expect industry participants to continue to look for ways to grow their business despite the challenging regulatory environment for example in december 2012 nyse and ice entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which ice would acquire nyse hkex completed its acquisition of the london metal exchange in 2012 

other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may become competitive with us through acquisitions federal law allows institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar products to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can in addition our competitors may 

 19 

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

a decline in our fees or any loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

changes in regulations as a result of implementation of the doddfrank act and other restructuring of the regulation of the global financial markets or otherwise may adversely impact our ability to compete especially on a global basis 

our contract volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our contract volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly pricesensitive business for example in recent years some of our competitors have engaged in aggressive pricing strategies including lowering the fees that they charge for taking liquidity and increasing liquidity paymentsrebates they provide as an incentive for providers of liquidity in certain markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers or that we will not be required to modify our pricing structure to compete effectively changes in our pricing structure may result in a decrease in our profit margin we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms if we are unable to effectively compete we could experience decreased volumes the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers two firms each represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2012  should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our contract volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of contract volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected the shortfall in customer segregated funds at mf global and the misappropriation of customer property at peregrine financial group inc pfg may have an impact on the overall confidence in the futures markets which could have a negative impact on contract volume furthermore declines in contract volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of contract volume 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while we generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on private causes of actions in cases where we have not behaved in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide for example we served as the designated self regulatory organization for mf global there are ongoing investigations by the department of justice the fbi the cftc and the sec into the events surrounding the mf global bankruptcy including determining which individuals and entities may have civil or criminal liability for the shortfall we continue to believe that we acted appropriately and that our actions do not give rise to liability we have been named as a party to a number of lawsuits in connection with the mf global matter which have been consolidated there is no guarantee that we will not become the subject of additional litigation relating to the matter or that we will be successful in defending against these claims or any other action relating to mf global or any matter brought in the future we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

our role in the global marketplace may place us at greater risk than other companies for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and contract volume and result in significant liabilities we could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems 

we regard the secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations our networks and those of our thirdparty service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access fraud computer viruses denial of service attacks terrorism firewall or encryption failures and other security problems recently groups have targeted the financial services industry as part of their protest against the perceived lack of regulation of the financial sector and economic inequality including calls to their supporters to launch cyber attacks on numerous financial institutions which in some cases have resulted in brief outages to their external corporate web sites our role in the global marketplace may place us at greater risk than other public companies for a cyber attack and other information security risks 

additionally our role as a leading derivatives marketplace and the operation of our cme globex electronic trading platform may place us at greater risk for misappropriation of our intellectual property for example in 2012 a former employee of cme group plead guilty to theft of our trade secrets while we do not believe that any customer information trade data or required regulatory information was compromised in this incident and we have no evidence that the trade secrets were distributed in connection with this matter we cannot assure you that we will not be the subject of future malfeasance other persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 

although we have not been the victim of cyber attacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition we have from time to time experienced cyber security breaches such as computer viruses and similar information technology violations that are typical for a company of our size that operates in the global financial marketplace as part of our global information security program we employ resources to monitor the environment and protect our infrastructure against such cyber attacks and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property assets however these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed which could result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower contract volume incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive advantage 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business while we have undertaken significant measures to develop business continuity plans and to establish backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business such attack may result in the closure of our trading and clearing facilities or render our backup data and recovery systems inoperable damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to our business 

the success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 21 

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or our current or potential customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market for example our colocation facility hosts a significant portion of our customers infrastructure while we have undertaken measures to secure such facility and to implement disaster recovery measures if we were to experience an outage at such location it could have a significant impact on our revenues and reputation 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as canceled such errors may result in cme group being liable or in our voluntary assumption of financial liability we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material adverse impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak contract volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in contract volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future contract volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual contract volume and order messaging traffic without 

failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex contract volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy generally our goal is to design our systems to handle two times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

we as well as many of our customers depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased contract volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties and the level of soundness of our clearing firms could adversely affect us 

our clearing house operations expose us to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely guarantee transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers over the last few years the global financial markets have experienced significant uncertainty and negative conditions as a result of the continued financial crisis that began in 2008 as a result many of our customers have encountered credit limitations losses resulting from lower asset values consolidations legislative changes and reduced liquidity we could be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of one of our clearing firms 

as part of our overall growth initiatives we have expanded our clearing services to the overthecounter market in addition to standard futures and options on futures products including products offered for clearing through cme clearport and our credit default swap and interest rate swap clearing initiatives the process for setting margins and establishing other financial safeguards for overthecounter products is different and in part seeks to assess and capture different risks than our historical practices applied to our futures and options on futures products although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our other financial safeguards for overthecounter products there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect market participants from the unique risks of these products or ensure that our financial safeguards will suffice to cover clearing member defaults in extreme circumstances 

in 2011 cme clearing europe was launched while we have hired experienced management to oversee the operations of cme clearing europe as an organization we have limited experience operating a clearing house outside of the united states 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to the clearing house and its margin and guaranty fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default in addition we have established a 100 million fund designed to provide payments up to certain maximum levels to family farmers ranchers and other agricultural industry 

participants who use our products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances when their clearing firm member becomes insolvent 

the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market 

to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit a certain amount of funds to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements with our clearing house as collateral for its trading activity we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and foreign sovereign debt and subject them to established haircuts based on the type of collateral and maturity given the level of market volatility there is no guarantee that these investments will continue to maintain their value to the extent a clearing firm was not in compliance with these requirements it would be required to acquire additional funds decrease its proprietary trading activity andor transfer customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products 

intellectual property rights licensed from third party price reporting agencies form the basis for many of our products from which we derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue recent regulatory scrutiny into such benchmarks could have a negative impact on our ability to offer such products 

we are significantly dependent on the contract volume of products which are based on intellectual property rights of indexes derived from third party price reporting agencies including our benchmark eurodollar contract which is based on libor to comply with cftc core principles we must be able to demonstrate that our products may not be readily subject to manipulation following the wellpublicized issues relating to the credibility of libor there has been heightened scrutiny surrounding the integrity and potential manipulation of libor and other benchmarks which are derived from price reporting agencies our inability to offer products based on these indexes could have a negative impact on our contract volume and revenues 

our market data revenues may be reduced or eliminated by decreased demand overall economic conditions or the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems if we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we will experience a reduction in revenues 

we sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions excluding our index market data offerings revenues from our market data and information services represented 12  and 10  of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively a decrease in overall contract volume may also lead to a decreased demand for our market data from the market data vendors for example in both 2012  and 2011  we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data devices due to the continued economic uncertainty continued high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms additionally electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate exchange fees for supplying market data to trading terminals if we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals we will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost market data revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter market as discussed in the following risk factor and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions investments or other strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

there is no guarantee that our overthecounter initiatives will be successful 

our goal is to provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the market for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to a single clearing house we offer clearing services for cleared overthecounter derivatives including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps our strategy also includes extending our overthecounter services into other assets classes as well as enhancing our cme clearport functionality to support additional products while we believe the implementation of doddfrank creates new opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter offerings the current regulatory environment for trading and clearing these products remains uncertain we cannot be certain that we will be 

able to operate profitably under the new legislation for example provisions within doddfrank include changes to the cftcs core principles specifically core principal 9 which could require us to make modifications to the manner in which certain of our contracts trade andor require that such products be delisted as futures and relisted as swaps in addition a number of market participants and exchanges have developed competing platforms and products including ices offering for credit default swaps we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively or that our initiatives will be successful 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions investments and other strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of the increasing consolidation in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us to the extent the trend of consolidation in our industry continues we may encounter increased difficulties in identifying growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration may also produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from strategic growth initiatives we have made or will make in the future which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we may also be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively impact our stock price 

expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our operations internationally including through cme clearing europe our proposed uk exchange directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 in addition as a result of our expanding global operations we are subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities including the fsa in connection with cme clearing europe our marketing efforts in europe and our proposed uk exchange these may include laws rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business to date we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets we may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators raised during regulatory examinations or we may otherwise become subject to their inquiry and oversight the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance review and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk 

of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which could be significant any of these outcomes may adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business in february 2013 the cftc filed suit against nymex and two former employees alleging disclosure of confidential customer information in violation of the commodity exchange act based on our initial review of the complaint we believe that we have strong factual and legal defenses to the claim 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees and agents including employees of gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that engages primarily in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures to generate liquidity could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions or result in our voluntary assumption of financial liability 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example in 2012 a former employee of cme group plead guilty to theft of our trade secrets in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and electronic execution services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we may still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 29 billion  of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 18 billion  

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt our exchanges and clearing house are also required to maintain capital as defined by the cftc at least equal to six months of their applicable operating expenses 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in february 2012 sp lowered our rating to aa with a negative outlook from aa with a negative outlook the ratings action stemmed from the newly provided protection we extended to trading customers of defaulted clearing member firms the continued negative outlook reflects sps view of the potential legal and reputational fallout from the mf global bankruptcy in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital 

our investment in bmfbovespa subjects us to investment and currency risk 

we own an interest in bmfbovespa representing approximately 5 of its outstanding shares which had a fair value of 6906 million  as of december 31 2012  as an exchange its ability to maintain or expand its contract volume and operate its business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject additionally its stock is valued in brazilian real which subjects us to currency risk there is no guarantee that our investment in bmfbovespa will be profitable 

any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets or investments may result in material noncash writedowns and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity 

in connection with our acquisitions and investments including our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings we have recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by applying a fair value test looking at historical performance capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise in the past we have recorded impairment charges in connection with some of our investments including our investment in bmfbovespa we may continue to experience future events that result in impairments the risk of impairment losses may increase to the extent our market capitalization and earnings decline an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results and could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our existing or future debt agreements 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

we have historically experienced relatively higher contract volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower contract volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure for example we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically than for trades executed on the trading floor in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability will be adversely affected 

eighteen of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their rights to elect directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

eighteen of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms that own trading rights on our exchanges we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members in 2012  79  of our contract volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result holders of our class a common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their method of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

our members and permit holders have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges and in connection with our agreement to acquire kcbt our members and permit holders have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are also entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to the operation of our open outcry trading facilities and certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

tableend class a common stock 

our class a common stock is currently listed on nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” as of february 13 2013 there were approximately 3106  holders of record of our class a common stock 

in may 2012 the companys board of directors declared a fiveforone split of its class a common stock effected by way of a stock dividend to its class a and class b shareholders the stock split was effective july 20 2012 for all shareholders of record on july 10 2012 as a result of the stock split all amounts related to shares and per share amounts have been retroactively restated 

the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of our class a common stock on a quarterly basis as reported on nasdaq 



class b common stock 

our class b common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized overthecounter market each class of our class b common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our cme exchange cmes rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights each share of our class b common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights 

class b shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold or leased through our shareholder relations and membership services department although our class b shareholders have special voting rights because our class b shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our class a shares we expect that the market price of our class b common stock if reported separately from the associated trading rights would be determined by the value of our class a common stock   as of february 13 2013 there were approximately 1697  holders of record of our class b common stock 

dividends 

the following table sets forth the dividends we paid on our class a and class b common stock in the last two years 



we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders according to our annual dividend policy which remains at approximately 50 of the prior years cash earnings the decision to declare a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our future earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant on january 30 2013  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 045  per share the dividend will be payable on march 25 2013  to shareholders of record on march 8 2013  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the 

total first quarter dividend payment will be approximately 1493 million  the board of directors declared an annual variable dividend of 130 per share on december 5 2012 and was payable on december 28 2012 to the shareholders of record on december 17 2012 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined after the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year the annual variable dividend for 2013 was accelerated to the fourth quarter of 2012 due to uncertainty surrounding dividend income tax treatment beginning in 2013 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 364day clearing house credit facility for 50 billion and our 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

for example under our senior credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of september 30 2012 after giving effect to actual share repurchases made and special dividends paid including annual variable dividends but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid after september 30 2012 and in no event greater than 20 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends during the term of the agreement multiplied by 065 in addition our 364day clearing house credit facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 6250 million 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries including cme in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

cme group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of their state of incorporation which could also limit its or their ability to declare and pay dividends

overview 

business overview 

cme group a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for cme cbot nymex and their respective subsidiaries as well as cme clearing europe limited cmece the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme groups class a common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” 

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts we also clear futures options on futures and overthecounter contracts through our three designated clearing organizations cme clearing which is a division of cme kcbtcc and cmece futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals we also clear overthecounter contracts on a range of product lines including interest rate swaps credit default swaps foreign exchange energy and agricultural commodities 

our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

our major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our cme and cmece clearing houses 

our clearing houses clear settle and guarantee every futures and options contract traded through our exchanges in addition to cleared overthecounter products our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing houses as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies 

business trends 

economic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite recent economic uncertainty and volatility in recent years trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the united states and european credit crises fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the federal reserve bank’s continued zero interest rate policy we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment  our industry is highly competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of recent regulatory reforms in the financial services industry competition is influenced by liquidity and transparency of the markets variability in fee structures breadth of product offerings including quality of new product development as well as efficient and innovative technology we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as the market continues to evolve we have worked to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers 

regulatory environment  exchangetraded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation as a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over recent years the   doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank was signed into law in july 2010 doddfrank is a comprehensive banking and financial  services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchangetraded while we believe that the new regulations will provide opportunities for our business the new regulations remain subject to additional rulemaking by various regulators to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of the new legislation and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted we continue to actively participate in the rulemaking process with the goal that the final regulations serve the public interest foster competition and innovation and do not place the us financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage pursuant to doddfrank in july 2012 the financial stability oversight council has designated cme as a systemically important financial market utility because it is operating as a us clearing house this designation creates additional regulatory oversight over our riskmanagement standards clearing and settlement activities 

as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign locations where we do business the financial services industry in europe is also undergoing similar regulatory reform which could result in additional regulation over our european operations 

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on leveraging our benchmark products enhancing our customer relations expanding our customer base advancing our clearing and trading technologies and deriving benefits from our integrated clearing houses as well as our scalable infrastructure we focus specifically on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes we believe that we can build on our competitive strengths by executing on the following initiatives 

 36 

 revenues 

clearing and transaction fees  a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privatelynegotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for contracts executed through our trading venues because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume in addition to the business trends noted earlier our contract volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenues 

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts limits on fees and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

product mix we offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearedonly swap contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products 

venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading and clearing platforms as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions privately negotiated transactions include block trades which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on cme globex or the trading floor 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services access and communication fees and various services related to our exchange and building operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through thirdparty distributors 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotations trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

access and communication fees access and communication fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform to our market data vendors and to direct market data customers as well as charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services including our colocation initiative which was launched in january 2012 access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers revenue from communication fees is dependent on open outcry trading as a portion relates to telecommunications on our trading floors 

other revenues to further diversify the range of services we offer we have entered into processing and development agreements with other exchanges and service organizations for example we have an agreement with bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa to develop a new multiasset class electronic trading platform for their customers we recognize revenue under this agreement as services are provided and when developed technology is delivered 

additionally other revenues include fees for administrating our interest earning facility ief program trade order routing and various services to members and clearing firms we offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various ief offerings these clearing firms receive interest income and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit in addition other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by gfx corporation gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that trades futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products other revenues also include gains on sales from various operating assets 

other revenues also include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants 

expenses 

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume licensing and other fee agreements and the majority of our employee bonuses do vary directly with contract volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee may adjust the target level of performance for material unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to stock options restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of options is derived using the blackscholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility the riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options granted the fair value of other awards is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices 

professional fees and outside services  this expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives and legal proceedings 

amortization of purchased intangibles this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with cbot holdings inc and nymex holdings inc as well as other asset and business acquisitions intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm market data and other customer relationships 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets such as buildings leasehold improvements furniture fixtures and equipment this expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

other expenses we incur additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include noncore investing and financing activities 

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be 

critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to the valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following threelevel fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value 

 for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 19 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted operating margins riskadjusted discount rates forecasted economic and market conditions and industry multiples we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates under certain favorable circumstances goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of goodwill relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

we also review indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable indefinitelived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values estimating the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates similar to goodwill under certain favorable circumstances indefinitelived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value the qualitative assessment of indefinitelived intangibles assets relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industryspecific trends 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 

revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing houses clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests 

income taxes  calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax such as municipal interest income and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs  certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance project stages are expensed as incurred while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software generally three years amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2011 and january 2013 the financial accounting standards board issued updates to existing rules over balance sheet offsetting disclosure the updates require entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain financial instruments eligible for offset in the balance sheet financial instruments may include derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions the objective of these disclosures is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and those entities that prepare their financial statements using international financial reporting standards the updates are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 and interim periods therein with retrospective application required for comparability purposes 

results of operations 

2012  financial highlights 

the comparability of our operating results for the periods presented may be impacted by mergers acquisitions and disposals of businesses andor asset groups where material these impacts are discussed in the analysis that follows 

the following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented 



 41 

expense partially offset the decrease in operating expenses in 2012 when compared with 2011 and contributed to an increase in expenses in 2011 when compared with 2010 in 2010 we also recognized impairment charges on the goodwill and trade name related to our cma operations 

 revenues 



clearing and transaction fees 

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing houses contract volume also includes certain clearedonly contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume all amounts exclude our credit default swap interest rate swap trakrs and cme clearing europe contracts the following table also excludes volume from kcbt from december 1 2012 through december 31 2012 



we estimate the following increases decreases in clearing and transaction fees based on change in total contract volume and change in average rate per contract during 2012  compared with 2011  and during 2011  compared with 2010  



average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure including volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation 

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume contract volume can be influenced by many factors including political and economic factors the regulatory environment and market competition 



1 the agricultural commodity product line does not   include the agricultural commodity contract volume for kcbt the average daily volume for kcbts agricultural commodity contracts was 16100 during december 2012 

interest rate products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key interest rate products eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years   



overall interest rate contract volume decreased in 2012 when compared with 2011 due to low interest rate volatility as a result of the federal reserves continued intent to maintain its zero interest rate policy through mid2015 in 2012 when compared with 2011 the increase in volume in the longterm interest rate products including the eurodollar back 32 futures and the treasury bond futures and options contracts was attributable to periods of higher longterm interest rate volatility in early 2012 the federal reserves announcement in january 2012 to extend its zero interest rate policy shifted market expectations regarding longterm interest rates which resulted in periods of higher volatility in early 2012 

in 2011 when compared with 2010 the overall increase in interest rate contract volume was attributable to volatility caused by a change in market expectations regarding shortterm and longterm interest rates tied to the federal reserves announcement in 2011 that it intended to maintain its zero interest rate policy through 2013 in addition volatility caused by the downgrade of the united states credit rating in august 2011 also contributed to an increase in overall volume midterm interest rate contract volume which includes eurodollar back 32 futures and 5year us treasury futures and options grew at a faster rate than 

shortterm contract volume because of a shift from contracts based on shortterm interest rates to midterm interest rates due to the continued zero interest rate policy 

we also believe that overall us treasury futures and options contract volume increased in 2011 when compared with 2010 due to institutional portfolio adjustments caused by the downgrade of the united states credit rating many institutional portfolios are required to maintain an average minimum overall credit rating when the us treasury credit rating was downgraded the institutional portfolios had to sell investments with lower credit ratings and buy more us treasuries in order to increase their average minimum overall credit rating in addition the growth in overall us treasury futures and options contract volume was attributable to increased demand for us treasury securities as a safe haven investment during the european credit crisis 

equity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key equity products 



the decrease in equity contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was due to a decline in equity market volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index the decline in volatility was the result of few new developments in the macroeconomic environment within the united states and european markets we believe a decline in assets under management also contributed to a decrease in volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 

in 2011 when compared with 2010 an overall increase in volatility contributed to higher equity contract volume we believe the periods of high volatility within the equity markets during the third quarter of 2011were attributable to the downgrade of the united states credit rating and the continuation of the sovereign debt crisis in europe in general equity products such as the emini nasdaq contracts that hedge market risks different than those of the emini sp 500 our most liquid equity product do not tend to benefit from macrolevel events or increased volatility to the same extent 

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key foreign exchange products 



the overall decrease in foreign exchange contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was attributable primarily to the decline in euro contract volume we believe trading activity in euro contracts was impacted by the lack of a directional trend due to uncertainty related to the health of the european union and concern regarding additional economic stimulus provided by the federal reserve the lack of a trend has reduced trading in euro contracts among customers who trade based on medium to longterm expectations we believe th uncertainty with the european union also contributed to a decline in british pound contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 because the british economy is closely tied to the european union we believe that intervention by the japanese central bank to control the yen foreign exchange rate beginning in mid2011 through 2012 caused market participants to reduce their trading in japanese yen contracts and to focus on higher yielding currencies such as the australian and canadian dollars 

in 2011 when compared with 2010 foreign exchange contract volume remained at a consistent level we believe that intervention by the japanese central bank to control the yen foreign exchange rate and uncertainty about the euro as a result of the european sovereign debt crisis caused the market to move to safe haven currencies such as the australian dollar and the canadian dollar as a result euro and japanese yen contract volume decreased while australian dollar volume increased 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products 



1 wheat contract volume does not   include volume for kcbts hard red winter wheat products the average daily volume for kcbts agricultural commodity contracts was 16100 during december 2012 

the increase in agricultural commodity contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was attributable to higher volatility resulting from severe drought conditions in the midwest in the second and third quarters of 2012 we believe the increased volatility was the result of supply constraint concerns for soybean and wheat supplies corn volumes declined slightly in 2012 when compared with 2011 early market expectations of excess supply in 2012 dampened corn price volatility in early 2012 which resulted in the decline in volume 

we believe that the increase in contract volume in 2011 when compared with 2010 was attributable to a decline in supply due to various weather events including flooding drought and excessive heat the change in supply resulted in increased volatility and higher grain prices we also believe that the increase in volume resulted from increased demand for feedgrains caused by higher demand for cattle and other proteins in emerging markets 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products 



energy contract volume decreased slightly in 2012 when compared with 2011 a decline in crude oil contract volume resulting from lower price volatility contributed to an overall decrease in energy products volume political unrest in the middle east in the first quarter of 2011 resulted in changes in global supply which contributed to higher price volatility in early 2011 relative to 2012 additionally lower crude oil contract volume in 2012 was partially attributable to oversupply in cushing oklahoma we believe that the reversal of the seaway pipeline in the second quarter of 2012 and ongoing capacity increases in the pipeline will continue to relieve oversupply and provide needed infrastructure for ongoing expected north american crude oil supply increases however uncertainty remains over the timing and extent of the impact the reversal will have on the overall crude oil market the decrease in crude oil contract volume was partially offset by an increase in natural gas contract volume the increase in natural gas contract volume resulted largely from volatility around production shifts in the early part of 2012 refined products growth is due to increased volatility caused by a growing us export market as global oil markets adapt to increased supply of north american crude oil despite refinery shutdowns 

in 2011 when compared with 2010 we believe the increase in energy contract volume was attributable to increased price volatility within the energy market during the first quarter of 2011 we also believe that increased volatility caused by weatherrelated events led to an increase in natural gas contract volume in 2011 

metal products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products 



the overall decrease in metal products volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was due to lower volatility in the precious metals markets in 2012 when compared with 2011 we believe the august 2011 announcement of the federal reserves intent to maintain its zero interest rate policy and deepening eurozone worries which caused high volatility within other financial markets in 2011 resulted in an increased interest in precious metals as an asset class this increased interest in 2011 resulted in relative decreases in gold and silver contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in volume for copper contracts as a result of economic growth in asia as well as global supply constraints 

the overall increase in metal contract volume in 2011 when compared with 2010 was attributable to the increased investment in precious metals as an asset class due to high volatility and uncertainty within the financial markets we believe that there was an increase in silver contract volume due to the greater use of silver as an alternative investment 

average rate per contract 

the average rate per contract increased in 2012 when compared with 2011 due to a shift in the relative mix of product volume in 2012 agricultural commodity and energy product volumes when measured as a percentage of total volume each increased by 2  while interest rate and equity product volumes decreased by 3  and 2  respectively agricultural commodity and energy products have higher fees compared with interest rate products and equity products 

in 2011 when compared with 2010 the average rate per contract decreased due to an increase in member contract volume which increased faster than nonmember trading in general members receive lower rates when compared with nonmembers 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers two firms each represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2012  one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2011  one firm represented 13  and one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2010  should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm 

other sources of revenue 

market data and information services the decline in market data and information services revenue in 2012 when compared with 2011 resulted from a 532 million decrease in market data and information services revenue from index services and cma in the second quarter of 2012 the dji asset group including assets which generated market data and information services revenue was contributed to the mcgraw venture and cma was sold to mcgraw in addition the decrease in revenue was due to a decline in the basic device count in 2012 due to costcutting initiatives at customer firms the decrease in market data and information services was partially offset by an increase in our basic device service fee from 61 per month to 70 per month effective january 2012 

revenues from index services contributed to an increase in market data and information services revenue in 2011 when compared with 2010 in march 2010 we formed index services which generated additional revenues of 356 million in 2011 when compared with 2010 in addition revenues from index services increased in 2011 when compared with 2010 due to growth in assets under management which was driven by underlying index market performance the overall increase in 2011 when compared with 2010 was partially offset by a decline in revenue due to a decrease in basic device counts resulting from costcutting initiatives at customer firms 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented in aggregate 43  39  and 45  of our market data and information services revenue in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of 

our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 

access and communication fees  our colocation program contributed to an increase in access and communication fees revenue from 2010 through 2012 during the fourth quarter of 2011 we substantially completed installations of equipment for customers and launched our colocation services on january 29 2012 we generated incremental revenue of 478 million in 2012 when compared with 2011 and incremental revenue of 34 million  in 2011 when compared with 2010 

other revenue in 2012 when compared with 2011 the decrease in other revenue was largely due to a decline in rental income of 131 million resulting from the sale of the cbot buildings in chicago in the second quarter of 2011 we recognized a 98 million gain on the sale of certain index services assets related to one of its service offerings which contributed to a decrease in other revenues in 2012 when compared with 2011 the initial phase to develop a new multiasset class electronic platform for bmfbovespa was completed in the third quarter of 2011 which also resulted in a decrease in other revenues in 2012 the decrease in other revenues in 2012 when compared with 2011 was partially offset by additional processing services revenue from various strategic relationships 

in 2011 when compared with 2010 the increase in other revenues was largely attributable to the 98 million gain on the sale of certain index services assets and additional processing services revenue the increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues resulting from our platform development for bmfbovespa 

expenses 



2012 compared with 2011 

operating expenses decreased by 369 million  in 2012 when compared with 2011 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the decrease in operating expenses 



in 2012 when compared with 2011 an increase in salaries benefits and employer taxes resulted from higher salaries and rising healthcare costs the increase was partially offset by a decrease in average headcount as a result of the contribution of the dji asset group to the mcgraw venture and the sale of cma in the second quarter of 2012 

the increase in stockbased compensation expense was due to the accelerated vesting of stockbased compensation associated with our ceo transition in 2012 as well as the impact related to the september 2011 and 2012 grants 

an increase in our nonqualified deferred compensation liability the impact of which does not affect net income because of an equal and offsetting change in investment income contributed to an increase in compensation and benefits expense 

bonus expense decreased due to performance relative to our 2012 cash earnings target when compared with 2011 performance relative to our 2011 cash earnings target 

amortization of purchased intangibles declined as a result of the contribution of the dji asset group the sale of cma and the disposal of certain leaserelated intangible assets in the second quarter of 2012 

overall expenses also decreased in 2012 when compared with 2011 due to the expenses incurred in 2011 as a result of the mf global bankruptcy filing in the fourth quarter of 2011 which included writeoffs of accounts receivable legal fees and losses on collateral posted by gfx and held by mf global in customer segregated funds as well as other related expenses in 2012 we recognized a recovery on the losses incurred on collateral posted by gfx in 2011 

2011 compared with 2010 

operating expenses increased by 869 million  in 2011 when compared with 2010 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase in operating expenses 



salary increases and rising healthcare costs contributed to a rise in salaries benefits and employer taxes an increase in average headcount primarily due to the formation of index services and investment in strategic growth initiatives also contributed to an increase in expense in 2011 when compared with 2010 

expenses increased due to the mf global bankruptcy filing in the fourth quarter of 2011 

stockbased compensation increased in 2011 due to the expense impact related to the september 2010 and 2011 grants 

marketing expenses increased in 2011 due primarily to new advertising initiatives 

a decrease in professional fees in 2011 was attributable to the formation and integration of index services which occurred in the first quarter of 2010 

impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2010 on the goodwill and trade name related to our cma operations also contributed to a decrease in expenses in 2011 when compared with 2010 

nonoperating income expense 



  

nm not meaningful 

investment income the increase in investment income during 2012 when compared with the same period in 2011 was attributable to an increase in gains on marketable securities related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan of 57 million gains and losses from these nonqualified deferred compensation plan securities are offset by an equal amount of compensation and benefits expense the increase in investment income was also attributable to other gains on investments the increase in investment income was partially offset by a decrease in dividend income of 59 million in 2012 compared with the same period in 2011 due largely to a decrease in dividends from our investment in bmfbovespa in 2012 when compared with 2011 

the decrease in investment income during 2011 when compared with 2010 was due to a decline in gains on marketable securities related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans of 41 million  in addition we recognized a gain of 37 million from the sale of various equity and debt securities in 2010 which contributed to the decrease in investment income in 2011 when compared with 2010 the decrease in 2011 when compared with 2010 was partially offset by an increase in dividend income from our investment in bmfbovespa total overall dividend income was 349 million  in 2011 compared with 319 million  in 2010 

gains losses on derivative investments  in 2010 we recognized an 86 million loss due to ineffectiveness on the interest rate swap contract used to hedge interest rate risk on our term loan both the swap contract and the term loan were originally scheduled to expire in august 2011 in december 2010 we approved a plan to refinance the term loan in january 2011 resulting in ineffectiveness of the hedge 

additionally in march 2010 we recognized a 60 million gain on derivative investments as a result of a settlement from the lehman brothers holdings inc lehman bankruptcy proceedings the settlement related to an unsecured claim against lehman as counterparty to an overthecounter put option contract we purchased to hedge our risk of changes in the fair value of bmfbovespa stock resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the brazilian real 

interest and other borrowing costs  the following table shows the weighted average borrowings outstanding weighted average effective yield and average cost of borrowing for the periods presented 



1 average cost of borrowing includes interest the effective portion of interest rate hedges commitment fees discount accretion and debt issuance costs 

on september 10 2012 we issued 7500 million of 30 fixed rate notes due september 2022 which contributed to the increase in the weighted average borrowings outstanding and decreases in weighted average effective yield the average cost of borrowings increased in 2012 when compared with 2011 because of higher commitment fees on the 364day fully secured committed line of credit resulting from an increase in the commitment 

interest expense decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to repayment of the 4205 million term loan in january 2011 and the maturity of the 3000 million floating rate notes in august 2010 the decrease in 2011 compared with 2010 was partially offset by the issuance in march 2010 of 6125 million of 440 fixed rate notes which are due in 2018 as a result there was a decrease in weighted average borrowings and an increase in weighted average effective yield and average cost of borrowings in 2011 when compared with 2010 

equity in net gains losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2012 we recognized income from our investment in the mcgraw venture which contributed to increases in equity in net gains losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2012 when compared with 2011 

other income expense in 2012 we recognized a net gain of 589 million related to the contribution of the dji asset group and the sale of cma additionally in 2012 we recognized a gain of 57 million related to the recovery of a 2008 impairment loss on a corporate debt security held in the nymex securities lending portfolio 

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 



in 2011 we reduced our income tax provision by 6460 million  due largely to a revaluation of our existing deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in state tax apportionment this revaluation contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate in 2012 when compared with 2011 and a decrease in the effective tax rate in 2011 when compared with 2010 in 2012 we established deferred income tax liabilities associated with the mcgraw venture resulting in a 1068 million  increase in our income tax provision which also contributed to a higher effective tax rate in 2012 when compared with 2011 additionally in the first quarter of 2011 we began marking to market our investment in bmfbovespa which resulted in a 488 million  reduction in valuation allowances on unrealized capital losses previously reserved which also reduced our effective tax rate in 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

we have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations while our cost structure is fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are dependent on contract volume levels we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments however it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2012  these were as follows 

  

 operating leases include rent payments for office space in chicago and other smaller offices in the united states and in various foreign countries the operating lease for our headquarters in chicago expires in november 2022 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 110 million  to 135 million  we also maintain operating leases for additional office spaces in chicago which expire in november 2023 and april 2027 annual minimum rental payments under these leases range from 48 million  to 62 million  and 29 million to 43 million respectively 

purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to purchase software licenses hardware and maintenance as well as telecommunication services other longterm liabilities include funding obligations for other postretirement benefit plans as well as contingent consideration 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through additional investment in our colocation program increased system capacity and performance improvements each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data centers telecommunications network and other operating equipment in 2013  we expect capital expenditures to total between 1400 million  and 1500 million  we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders the decision to pay a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant cme group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends the distribution target under our annual dividend policy remains at approximately 50 of the prior years cash earnings on january 30 2013  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 045  per share the dividend will be payable on march 25 2013  to shareholders of record on march 8 2013  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately 1493 million  the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 130 per share on december 5 2012 paid on december 28 2012 to the shareholders of record on december 17 2012 this annual dividend will typically be considered in the first quarter of each year and will supplement the regular dividend the annual variable dividend for 2013 was accelerated to the fourth quarter of 2012 due to uncertainty surrounding dividend income tax treatment beginning in 2013 in general the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined after the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year 

sources and uses of cash 

the following is a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



operating activities 

in 2012 when compared with 2011 net cash provided by operating activities decreased as a result of lower contract volumes 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly in 2011 when compared with 2010 increased profitability as a result of higher contract volumes was offset by an increase in other current assets and other assets resulting from a reclassification of cash from cash and cash equivalents to other current assets and other assets because the cash became subject to restrictions in conjunction with the contribution to the cmece guaranty fund 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities in 2012 was higher than cash used in 2011 due to the increased investment in business ventures partially offset by the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the cbot buildings 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2011 when compared with 2010 was due to the proceeds from the sales of a longterm investment and our exercise rights privileges in 2010 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was lower in 2012 when compared with 2011 the decrease in cash used was attributable to the receipt of 7477 million in proceeds from debt issued in september 2012 in contrast with repayments of 4205 million of debt in the first quarter of 2011 in addition we repurchased 2204 million of class a common stock in 2011 the net decrease in cash used was partially offset by a 8515 million  increase in cash dividends paid in 2012 when compared with 2011 

the increase in cash used in 2011 compared with 2010 was attributable to proceeds from our issuance of shares to bmfbovespa in 2010 and an increase in cash dividends in 2011 when compared with 2010 the increase in cash used was partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases of 3549 million  in 2011 when compared with the same period in 2010 

debt instruments 

the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2012  

  

 in november 2012 the multicurrency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions was increased from 10 billion to 18 billion the proceeds from the revolving senior credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes which includes providing liquidity for our cme clearing house in certain circumstances and if necessary for maturities of commercial paper as long as we are not in default under the new senior credit facility we have the option to increase the facility up to 23 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds in november 2012 the maturity date was extended from january 2014 to january 2016 except for 950 million of the existing commitments the 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility includes a provision to issue up to 2500 million of standby letters of credit the senior credit facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty under our credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test which is defined as our consolidated shareholders equity as of september 30 2012 giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreement and in no event greater than 20 billion in aggregate multiplied by 065 we currently do not have any borrowings under this credit facility 

we maintain a 364day multicurrency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our cme clearing house we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian for our collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms cme clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of us treasury securities us government agency securities or money market mutual funds as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility at december 31 2012  guaranty fund collateral available was 48 billion  the line of credit provides for borrowings of up to 50 billion we have the option to request an increase in the line from 50 billion to 70 billion subject to the approval of participating banks in addition to the 364day multicurrency line of credit we also have the option to use the 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default in certain circumstances 

in addition our 364day multicurrency line of credit contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as cme consolidated shareholders equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 6250 million in the event that cme elects to increase the facility the minimum consolidated tangible net worth test would increase ratably up to 8750 million 

the indentures governing our fixed rate notes our 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility and our 364day multicurrency line of credit for 50 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

at december 31 2012  we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 18 billion under our multicurrency revolving senior credit facilities 

at december 31 2012  we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

to satisfy our performance bond obligation with singapore exchange limited we may pledge cmeowned us treasury securities in lieu of or in combination with irrevocable letters of credit at december 31 2012  we had pledged letters of credit totaling 1810 million  

the following table summarizes our credit ratings as of december 31 2012  



given our cash flow generation our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities if necessary we expect to maintain an investment grade rating if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2012  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the securities and exchange commission 

liquidity and cash management 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 16 billion  at december 31 2012  and 10 billion  at december 31 2011  the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices a majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in us treasury securities or us government agency securities our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that a 199 million  contribution in 2013  will allow us to meet our funding goal however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2013  and the december 31 2013  discount rate 

regulatory requirements 

cme and kcbtcc are regulated by the commodity futures trading commission cftc as us derivatives clearing organizations dco beginning in may 2012 dcos are required to maintain capital as defined by the cftc in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash liquid securities or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses cme and kcbtcc are in compliance with the dco financial requirements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2012  consisted of fixed rate borrowings of 29 billion  changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixedrate debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows we did not have any variable rate borrowings at december 31 2012  

credit risk 

our clearing houses act as the counterparties to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through thirdparty exchanges and overthecounter markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our 

clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in november 2012 we acquired the board of trade of kansas city missouri inc kcbt including the kansas city board of trade clearing corporation kcbtcc we expect to integrate kcbtcc operations with the operations of cme clearing a division of cme during 2013 as of december 31 2012 we maintained a separate financial safeguard package for kcbtcc clearing firms in february 2013 the kcbtcc financial safeguard package was incorporated into the cme clearing financial safeguard package 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for exchangetraded and overthecounter products including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps for cme and kcbtcc clearing firms we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk for cmece clearing firms we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 95 to 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk we establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity we marktomarket all open positions of cme kcbtcc and cmece clearing firms at least twice a day and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value for select clearedonly markets positions are markedtomarket daily with the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant these practices allow our clearing houses to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions this transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity 

despite our safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

cme clearing 

we maintain three separate financial safeguard packages for cme clearing member firms 

 in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use the corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit 

we maintain a 50 billion 364day multicurrency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by cme clearing we have the option to request an increase in the line from 50 billion to 70 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as select money market mutual funds approved for our select interest earning facility ief programs performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day multicurrency line of credit we also have the option to use our 18 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default 

aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for all three cme financial safeguard packages was 868 billion  including 56 billion  of cash performance bond deposits and 42 billion  of letters of credit a defaulting firms performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm

cmece 

we maintain a financial safeguard package for cmece overthecounter commodity clearing firms in the unlikely event of default by a cmece clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations these assets include the defaulting firms performance bonds aggregate cash performance bond deposits for cmece clearing firms were 545 million  there were no noncash performance bonds on deposit at december 31 2012  thereafter if the default remains unsatisfied after first applying assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation we would use guaranty fund contributions of 600 million of cmece funds for commodity clearing firms as of december 31 2012  guaranty fund contributions were contributed by cmece instead of by the clearing firms commodity clearing firms will begin contributing to the commodity guaranty fund in 2013 once the cmece clearing firms contribute to the commodity guaranty fund we would still use at least 200 million of cmece funds in addition to the clearing firms guaranty fund contributions in the event of a default of a commodity clearing firm 

beginning in 2013 we will maintain a separate financial safeguard package for cmece interest rate swap clearing firms cmece will begin offering to clear interest rate swap contracts in the first quarter of 2013 in the unlikely event of default by a cmece clearing firm we will first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations if the default remains unsatisfied we will apply guaranty fund contributions of 525 million for interest rate swap clearing firms that will be contributed by cmece instead of by the clearing firms in the future the interest rate swap clearing firms may be asked to contribute to the interest rate swap guaranty fund once the cmece clearing firms contribute to the guaranty fund we would still use at least 525 million of cmece funds in the event of a default of a interest rate swap clearing firm 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk resulting from our operations is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets and liabilities we report in our consolidated balance sheets the financial statements of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in various currencies and are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income aggregate translation adjustments net of tax for 2012  2011  and 2010  were 109 million  833 million  and 05 million  respectively in 2011 we 

reversed an unrealized loss of 817 million net of tax which was attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss upon recognizing impairment on our investment in bmfbovespa 

foreign currency risk related to equity investments 

we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain equity investments as discussed in the equity price risk section below 

foreign currency exchange risk related to customer collateral 

a portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in foreign currency we marktomarket all deposits once a day and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price therefore our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results 

equity price risk 

we hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded at their fair value fair values for publiclytraded equity investments are based on quoted market prices fair values are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value fluctuations in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 

the table below summarizes equity investments that are subject to equity price fluctuations at december 31 2012  equity investments are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 



we do not currently hedge against equity price risk equity investments are assessed for otherthantemporary impairment on a quarterly basis

the breadth and diversity of each of our product lines and the variety of their underlying contracts is beneficial to our overall performance when an individual product line or individual product is impacted by macroeconomic factors for example the impact to our interest rate product line due to the credit crisis and the federal reserve banks zero interest rate policy was partially offset by trading volume in our other product lines additionally our product lines contain various products designed to address differing risk management needs for example our interest product suite includes both shortterm and longterm products

there are ongoing investigations by the department of justice the federal bureau of investigations fbi the cftc and the sec into the events surrounding the mf global bankruptcy including efforts to locate the missing segregated customer property and determining which individuals and entities may have civil or criminal liability for the shortfall we were the designated selfregulatory organization for mf global meaning we were responsible for conducting periodic audits of the futures commission merchant pursuant to joint audit committee standards we believe that we carried out our duties and responsibilities in accordance with these standards and procedures we have been named in a number of lawsuits filed in connection with the mf global matter see legal matters in note 13 contingencies to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page 82 for more information on these proceedings 

as a result of the shortfall in customer segregated funds the industry its selfregulatory model and the segregation regime are under scrutiny several congressional hearings have been held to evaluate the situation and various policy suggestions have been made to ensure the protection of customer segregated funds the adoption of such regulations will likely increase our costs of providing clearing services 

patents trademarks and licenses 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and in other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we also own the copyright to a variety of materials those copyrights some of which are registered include printed and online 

publications web sites advertisements educational material graphic presentations and other literature both textual and electronic we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks patents copyrights database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods 

we offer equity index futures and options on key benchmarks including sp nasdaq dow jones and nikkei indexes we also have an agreement with the chicago board options exchange cboe to allow us to list futures and options on futures for volatility indexes on a variety of asset classes with the exception of dow jones these products are listed by us subject to license agreements with the applicable owners of the indexes we have exclusive arrangements with sp and the nasdaq omx group inc nasdaq and nonexclusive arrangements with the other third parties our rights to the dow jones indexes previously were evidenced by an exclusive agreement but are now part of our ownership of the joint venture our sp license is exclusive through 2016 and nonexclusive from that date until 2017 with some exceptions provided certain trading volume is achieved as previously discussed our proposed joint venture with mcgrawhill will provide us with a longterm ownershiplinked exclusive license to the sp indices our nasdaq license is exclusive through 2019 copies of our sp and nasdaq license arrangements have been filed as material contracts we pay the applicable third party per trade fees based on trading volume under the terms of these licensing agreements 

we also have a licensing and membership agreement with bba enterprises limited and the british bankers association collectively bba for the use of its london interbank offered rate libor to settle several of our interest rate products including our eurodollar contract for the license we paid an upfront fee and pay an annual fee numerous regulators including the sec cftc and the fsa are investigating whether there were attempts to manipulate libor rates libor rates play a significant role in the financial system to the extent the investigation finds that the libor rate was distorted or manipulated it could have a negative impact on our customers confidence in settlement prices dependent on libor including our benchmark eurodollar contract 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with sp and nasdaq or be able to maintain our other existing licensing arrangements in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments including securities and options based on the sp nasdaq or dow jones indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond our jurisdictional reach andor our licensors for example we are a party to a pending legal matter seeking a declaratory judgment that the opposing party is required to obtain a valid license in order to list certain products based upon the dow jones and sp indexes while we have prevailed on a motion for summary judgment the matter is currently pending appeal a negative decision in the matter would have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenues from our index services business 

seasonality 

generally we have historically experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters however such seasonality may also be impacted by general market conditions such as the 2008 economic crisis and the impact of the mf global bankruptcy during 2011  25  of our consolidated revenues were recognized in the first quarter 26  in the second quarter 27  in the third quarter and 22  in the fourth quarter 

working capital 

we generally meet our funding requirements with internally generated funds supplemented from time to time with public debt and commercial paper offerings for more information on our working capital needs see “managements discussion and analysis of operations and financial conditionliquidity and capital resources” beginning on page 33 which section is incorporated herein by reference 

customer base 

our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments our customers can access our cme globex trading platform across the globe customers may be members of one or more of our exchanges rights to directly access our markets will depend upon the nature of the customer such as whether the individual is a member of one of our exchanges or has executed an agreement with us for direct access 

rights and privileges of membership are exchange specific trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by our members membership on one of our futures exchanges also enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections in 2011  80  of our trading volume was conducted by our members 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2011  in the event a clearing firm were to withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange in 2011 mf global one of our largest clearing firms was placed into bankruptcy and we transferred all of their more than 30000 customer accounts to other futures commission merchants 

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the enactment of the doddfrank act doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry as discussed in the following section for example doddfrank provides for central clearing of “clearable” overthecounter swaps and requires that swaps that are cleared must be traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities unless no exchange or swap execution facility makes the swap available for trading while these new requirements create opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter business a number of market participants and other exchanges have developed and likely will develop in the future competing platforms and products 

we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others 

competition in our derivatives business 

we believe competition in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality maintain liquidity and low transaction costs and adopt such additional customer protections as the regulators and customers require as a result of the mf global bankruptcy 

our industry has continued to experience significant consolidation efforts many of these recent efforts have failed due to lack of shareholder support or regulatory issues including the nyse euronextdeutsche bourse proposed merger the london stock exchanges bid for the tmx group and the singapore stock exchanges proposed acquisition of the australian stock exchange at the end of 2011 there were approximately 60  futures exchanges located in approximately 30  countries we expect industry participants to continue to look for ways to grow their business despite the challenging regulatory environment and other exchanges may become the target of future consolidation efforts 

among our key competitors in our exchangetraded business are new york portfolio clearing nypc and the electronic liquidity exchange elx in our interest rate product line and intercontinentalexchange inc ice in our agricultural commodities currency equity index and energy contracts in early 2012 nyse liffe us announced it had secured an exclusive license to launch futures contracts based on the depository trust and clearing corporations proprietary general collateral finance repo index which will compete with our interest rate products our overthecounter business also competes with lchclearnet for our interest rate swaps and ice for our credit default swaps newer entrants into our industry may further increase competitive pressure on us 

because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets we also compete with nyse euronext and other securities and options exchanges dealer markets and alternative trading systems as well as with ice in connection with its futures and options on futures contracts based on the russell indexes 

we face competition from the overthecounter market with the trading of contracts similar to those traded or cleared on our exchanges such as swaps forward contracts and other exchange “lookalike” contracts in which parties directly negotiate the terms of their contracts as well as from spot markets etfs and other substitutes for our products development of swap execution facilities and the mandated clearing requirement for certain products may create platforms that promote competitive substitutes for our privately negotiated and exchangetraded products 

competition in our transaction processing business 

in addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with the implementation of doddfrank which requires the mandatory central clearing of standardized overthecounter products 

ice has its own clearing operations which are comprised of regulated clearing houses across the united states europe and canada occ issues and clears uslisted options and futures on a number of underlying financial assets including common stocks currencies and stock indexes including clearing services for elx in 2011 nypc a clearing house created by nyse euronext and the depository trust  clearing corporation began clearing interest rate products traded on nyse liffe us and plans to expand to additional exchanges in the future we believe that other exchanges may also undertake to provide clearing services 

we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the fees charged for the services provided quality and reliability of the services timely delivery of the services reputation offering breadth confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the value of providing customers with capital efficiencies 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent potential competitors because as purveyors of market data or trading software systems these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities as technology firms they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks additionally technology and software firms that develop trading systems hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets this may lead to decreased demand for our market data 

regulatory matters 

our operation of futures exchanges is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc under its principlesbased approach which requires that our exchange subsidiaries satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act and the commodity futures modernization act the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years which most recently occurred in 2008 

in light of the widespread financial and economic difficulties particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 there were calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets doddfrank which was signed into law in 2010 is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchangetraded doddfrank reinforces the core tenets of our markets 

 doddfrank also provides the federal reserve board with authority over systematically important financial entities we have been notified that our us clearing house may be regulated as a systematically important financial entity since adoption the cftc the sec the department of treasury and other regulators have engaged in extensive rulemaking to implement the legislation cme group and others in the industry continue to actively participate in the rulemaking process with the goal that the final regulations serve the public interest foster competition and innovation and do not place the us financial services 

sector at a competitive disadvantage in our evolving global financial markets during 2011 several regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to mandatory clearing and the operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting position limits and the definition of agricultural commodity a significant portion of the act however remains subject to further rulemaking and such final regulations could include provisions that could negatively impact our business additionally as a result of the mf global bankruptcy and the shortfall in commodities customer segregated funds the futures industry its selfregulatory model and the segregation regime are under scrutiny by the cftc and congress several congressional hearings have been held to evaluate the situation and various policy suggestions have been made to ensure the protection of customer segregated funds we have and expect to continue to incur significant additional costs to make the necessary change to our business to comply with the provisions of doddfrank and any new regulations stemming from the mf global matter 

our top areas of focus in the regulatory environment are 

 as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to the laws and regulations in the locations in which we do business 

the financial services industry outside of the united states is also undergoing similar significant reform particularly in europe for example in the united kingdom the government has proposed to reorganize its regulatory framework which would include the dissolution of the fsa with oversight to be transitioned to the bank of england the financial conduct authority and the prudential regulation authority depending upon the status of the regulated entity as a result in the united kingdom our operations could be subject to multiple regulators the european union is also undergoing similar reform with multiple supervisory authorities such as the european securities and markets authority esma established in 2011 in addition to the national regulators esma is likely to have a supervisory and oversight role over european clearing houses noneuropean clearing houses and noneuropean exchanges providing services in europe multiple legislations such as the european market infrastructure regulation the markets in financial instruments directive the capital requirements directive iv and the market abuse directive have been proposed with provisions similar to those contained in doddfrank 

to the extent the regulatory environment following these and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

as a result of the 2010 “flash crash” regulators have been focused on the role of high frequency traders and their impact on the markets although not clearly defined high frequency trading typically refers to professional traders acting in a proprietary capacity that engage in strategies that generate a large number of trades on a daily basis the cftc has formed a subcommittee to define high frequency trading which will begin the process of assessing the impact of such trading on the marketplace and the development of any new regulations we believe that such trading plays an important role in the marketplace by making it more efficient and competitive for all market participants and such firms contribute significantly to our liquidity at this time however it is unclear whether these inquires will result in restrictions on the use of high frequency trading 

in the united states and europe there are several proposals to tax financial transactions or to assess user fees for market participants for example in the united states there is a discussion of assessing a user fee to fund the cftc and in europe legislative bodies are considering a tax on all financial transactions in the past efforts to implement a transaction tax or user 

fee have not been successful the implementation of additional costs to use our markets may discourage institutions and individuals from using our products to manage their risks which could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level a transaction tax or user fee in the us may also cause market participants to transition andor increase their derivatives trading in jurisdictions outside the us which do not necessarily impose a comparable cost at this time 

in addition the us congress may propose to eliminate the favorable 6040 tax treatment for futures the current tax treatment for futures trading allows certain traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60 at capital gains rates and 40 at ordinary tax rates any repeal of 6040 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to certain individuals who are most responsible for creating liquid and efficient markets

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks that we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets our trading volume is directly affected by us domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

 15 

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically our trading volume has tended to increase during periods of heightened uncertainty due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however as evidenced by our performance during the economic volatility that began in 2008 in times of extreme uncertainty we may experience decreased volume due to factors such as decreased risk exposure lower interest rates and lack of available capital during 2011 the us economy remained constrained due to the inability of the housing market to gain any traction the fiscal drag from budget reduction programs at all levels of government and the continued uncertainty about future tax and regulatory policies impacting spending and investments of consumers and corporations europe also continues to face uncertainty with some eurozone countries in recession as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful this trend as well as future economic uncertainty may result in continued decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business and such environment is currently undergoing significant reform 

our business has been extensively regulated by the cftc in response to the economic crisis the doddfrank act was signed into law in 2010 this legislation is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchange traded in accordance with doddfrank the cftcs authority has been significantly expanded to include overthecounter derivatives 

since adoption the cftc the sec the department of treasury and other regulators have engaged in extensive rulemaking to implement the legislation cme group and others in the industry continue to actively participate in the rulemaking process with the goal that the final regulations serve the public interest foster competition and innovation and do not place the us financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage in our evolving global financial markets during 2011 several regulations implementing doddfrank were finalized including rules relating to mandatory clearing and the operation of a clearing house antimanipulation large trader reporting position limits and the definition of agricultural commodity a significant portion of the act however remains subject to further rulemaking and such final regulations could include provisions that could negatively impact our business including changes to core principle 9 and the implementation of the position limit rules additionally as a result of the mf global bankruptcy and the shortfall in segregated customer funds the futures industry its selfregulatory model and the segregation regime are under scrutiny by the cftc and congress several congressional hearings have been held to evaluate the situation and various policy suggestions have been made to ensure the protection of customer segregated funds the adoption of such legislation likely will increase our costs of providing clearing services 

as a global company with operations around the world we are also subject to the laws and regulations in the locations in which we do business we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations we also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by any of these regulatory agencies our subsidiaries cme clearing europe and cme marketing europe are also subject to the supervision and oversight of the fsa the regulatory environment in the united kingdom and the european union is undergoing significant reforms in connection with the oversight of the financial services industry in response to the economic crisis a number of financial service legislations covering issues similar to those included in doddfrank have also been proposed in europe 

to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of doddfrank and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

in the united states and europe there are several proposals to tax financial transactions or to assess user fees for market participants for example in the united states there is a discussion of assessing a user fee to fund the cftc and in europe legislative bodies are considering a tax on all financial transactions in the past efforts to implement a transaction tax or user fee have not been successful the implementation of additional costs to use our markets may discourage institutions and individuals from using our products to manage their risks which could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level a transaction tax or user fee in the us may also cause market participants to transition andor increase their derivatives trading in jurisdictions outside the us which do not necessarily impose a comparable cost at this time 

in addition the us congress may propose to eliminate the favorable 6040 tax treatment for futures the current tax treatment for futures trading allows certain traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60 at capital gains rates and 40 at ordinary tax rates any repeal of 6040 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to certain individuals who are most responsible for creating liquid and efficient markets 

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

some of our largest clearing firms which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with the futures industry association and the department of treasury have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms we expect pressure from these contingencies to increase in light of the shortfall in customer segregated funds held by mf global our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish or seek to use alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchanges even if they are not successful in their efforts the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets if any of these events occur our revenues and profits could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business will not survive 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the implementation of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry for example doddfrank provides for central clearing of “clearable” overthecounter swaps and requires that swaps that are cleared must be traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities unless no exchange or swap execution facility makes the swap available for clearing while these new requirements create opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter business a number of market participants and other exchanges have developed and likely will develop in the future competing platforms and products 

we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others 

our industry has continued to experience significant consolidation efforts many of these recent efforts have failed due to lack of shareholder support or regulatory issues including the nyse euronextdeutsche bourse proposed merger the london stock exchanges bid for the tmx group and the singapore stock exchanges proposed acquisition of the australian stock exchange at the end of 2011 there were approximately 60  futures exchanges located in approximately 30  countries we expect industry participants to continue to look for ways to grow their business despite the challenging regulatory environment and other exchanges may become the target of future consolidation efforts 

among our key competitors in our exchangetraded business are nypc and elx in our interest rate product line and ice in our agricultural commodities currency equity index and energy products in early 2012 nyse liffe us announced it had secured an exclusive license to launch futures contracts based on the depository trust and clearing corporations proprietary general collateral finance repo index which will compete with our interest rate products our overthecounter business also competes with lchclearnet for our interest rate swaps and ice for our credit default swaps newer entrants into our industry may further increase competitive pressure on us 

we believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies the number of businesses providing internetrelated financial services is rapidly growing other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may become competitive with us through acquisitions federal law allows institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar products to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out 

their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can in addition our competitors may 

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

a decline in our fees or any loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

changes in regulations as a result of the implementation of the doddfrank act and other restructuring of the regulation of the global financial markets regulations stemming from the mf global bankruptcy or otherwise may adversely impact our ability to compete especially on a global basis 

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2011  should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange for example in connection with the bankruptcy of mf global we successfully transferred all of the more than 30000 mf global customer accounts to other futures commission merchants additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our trading volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or we lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of trading volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected the shortfall in customer segregated funds at mf global may have an impact on the overall confidence in the futures markets which could have a negative impact on trading volume furthermore declines in trading volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of trading volume 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while we generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on private causes of actions in cases where we have not behaved in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide for example we served as the designated self regulatory organization for mf global there are ongoing investigations by the department of justice the fbi the cftc and the sec into the events surrounding the 

mf global bankruptcy including efforts to locate the missing segregated customer property and determining which individuals and entities may have civil or criminal liability for the shortfall we continue to believe that we acted appropriately and that our actions do not give rise to liability we have been named as a party to a number of lawsuits in connection with the mf global matter which we expect to be consolidated there is no guarantee that we will not become the subject of additional litigation relating to the matter or that we will be successful in defending against these claims or any other action relating to mf global or any matter brought in the future we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

our role in the global marketplace may place us at greater risk than other companies for a cyber attack and other cyber security risks our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities we could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems 

we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems including attacks from cyber criminals recently groups have targeted the financial services industry as part of their protest against the perceived lack of regulation of the financial sector and economic inequality including calls to their supporters to launch cyber attacks on numerous financial institutions which in some cases have resulted in brief outages to their external corporate web sites additionally in 2010 a virus impacted email systems around the world including our system while we have no evidence at this time that we are a specific target of a cyber attack our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other companies 

additionally our role as a leading derivatives marketplace and the operation of our cme globex electronic trading platform may place us at greater risk for misappropriation of our intellectual property in september 2011 a former employee of cme group was charged with two counts of theft of trade secrets in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury we do not believe that any customer information trade data or required regulatory information was compromised in this incident and we have no evidence that the trade secrets were distributed in connection with this matter other persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 

while we continue to employ resources to monitor the environment and protect our infrastructure against security breaches and misappropriation of our intellectual property assets these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed which could result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive advantage 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business for example the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on the world trade center resulted in the closing of nymexs trading and clearing operations for four business days and rendered its backup data and recovery center inoperable while we have undertaken significant measures to develop business continuity plans and to establish backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to our business 

the success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or our current or potential customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected additionally we rely on our customers ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled for example in 2010 an employee error resulted in errant trades inadvertently being placed into an active market environment which resulted in liability to us of approximately 47 million we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy generally our goal is to design our systems to handle at least two times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

we as well as many of our customers depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased trading volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties and the level of soundness of our clearing firms could adversely affect us 

our clearing house operations expose us to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely guarantee transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers as a result of the financial crisis that began in 2008 many financial institutions required additional capital infusions merged with larger and stronger institutions became bank holding companies that are regulated by the federal reserve bank and in some cases failed for example during 2008 the bear stearns companies inc lehman brothers holdings inc and american international group inc all of which were parent companies of clearing firms of our exchange experienced significant financial writedowns and in some cases failed in october 2011 mf global one of our largest clearing firms was placed into liquidation there are ongoing investigations by the department of justice the fbi the cftc and the sec into the events surrounding the mf global bankruptcy including efforts to locate the missing segregated customer property and determining which individuals and entities may have civil or criminal liability for the shortfall 

as part of our overall growth initiatives we have expanded our clearing services to the overthecounter market in addition to standard futures and options on futures products including through cme clearport and our credit default and interest rate swap clearing initiatives the process for deriving margins and financial safeguards for overthecounter products is different and in part seeks to assess and capture different risks than our historical practices applied to our futures and options on futures products although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards for overthecounter products there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect market participants from the unique risks of these products 

in 2011 cme clearing europe was launched while we have hired experienced management to oversee the operations of cme clearing europe as an organization we have limited experience operating a clearing house outside of the united states 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to the clearing house and its margin and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be adversely affected in the event of a significant default following the mf global bankruptcy we established a 100 million fund designed to provide further protection of customer segregated funds for eligible participating us family farmers and ranchers who hedge their business using our products for losses resulting from the future insolvency of a clearing member or other market participant 

the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market 

to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit a certain amount of funds to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements with our clearing house as collateral for their trading activity we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and foreign sovereign debt given the level of market volatility there is no guarantee that these investments will continue to maintain their value to the extent a clearing firm was not in compliance with these requirements it would be required to acquire additional funds decrease its proprietary trading activity andor transfer customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products 

our market data revenues may be reduced or eliminated by decreased demand overall economic conditions or the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems if we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we will experience a reduction in revenues 

we sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data and information services totaled 4277 million  and 3951 million  representing 13  of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively a decrease in overall trading volume may also lead to a decreased demand for our market data from the market data vendors for example in both 2011  and 2010  we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data devices due to the continued economic uncertainty continued high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms additionally electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate exchange fees for supplying market data to trading terminals if we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals we will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost market data revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter market as discussed in the following risk factor and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions investments or other strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

there is no guarantee that our overthecounter initiatives will be successful 

our goal is to provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the market for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to a single clearing house we offer clearing services for cleared overthecounter derivatives including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps our strategy also includes extending our overthecounter services into other assets classes as well as enhancing our cme clearport functionality to support additional products while we believe the implementation of doddfrank creates new opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter offerings the current regulatory environment for trading and clearing these products remains uncertain we cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably under the new legislation for example provisions within doddfrank include changes to the cftcs 

core principles specifically core principal 9 which could require us to make modifications to the manner in which certain of our contracts trade andor require that such products be delisted as futures and relisted as swaps in addition a number of market participants and exchanges have developed competing platforms and products including ices offering for credit default swaps we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively or that our initiatives will be successful 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions investments and other strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of the increasing consolidation in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us to the extent the trend of consolidation in our industry continues we may encounter increased difficulties in identifying growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration may also produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from strategic growth initiatives we have made or will make in the future which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we may also be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively impact our stock price 

expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our operations internationally including through cme clearing europe directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 in addition as a result of our expanding global operations we are subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities including the fsa in connection with cme clearing europe and our marketing efforts in europe these may include laws rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business to date we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets we may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in the normal course of our business we discuss matters with our regulators raised during regulatory examinations or we may otherwise become subject to their inquiry and oversight the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of 

noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which can be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees and agents including employees of gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that engages primarily in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures to generate liquidity could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions for example in 2010 an employee error resulted in errant trades inadvertently being placed into an active market environment which resulted in liability to us of approximately 47 million 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights for example in september 2011 a former employee of cme group was charged with two counts of theft of trade secrets in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and electronic execution services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we may still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2011  we had approximately 21 billion  of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 10 billion 

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in february 2012 sp lowered our rating to aa from aa with a negative outlook the rating actions stemmed from our limited financial support of trading customers through our guarantee provided to the mf global bankruptcy trustee and our new protection fund for certain farmers and ranchers using our products to hedge the negative outlook was based upon its view of the potential legal and reputational fallout from the mf global bankruptcy in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years and the fallout from mf global there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital 

our investment in bmfbovespa subjects us to investment and currency risk 

we own an interest in bmfbovespa representing approximately 5 of its outstanding shares which had a fair value of 5277 million  as of december 31 2011  as an exchange its ability to maintain or expand its trading volume and operate its business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject additionally its stock is valued in brazilian real which subjects us to currency risk there is no guarantee that our investment in bmfbovespa will be profitable 

any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets or investments may result in material noncash writedowns and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders equity 

in connection with our acquisitions and investments including our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings we have recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by applying a fair value test looking at historical performance capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise in the past we have recorded impairment charges in connection with some of our investments including our investment in bmfbovespa we may continue to experience future events that result in impairments the risk of impairment losses may increase to the extent our market capitalization and earnings decline an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results and could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our existing or future debt agreements 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

generally we have historically experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure for example we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically than for trades executed on the trading floor in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability will be adversely affected 

twenty of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their rights to elect directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

twenty of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchange we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members in 2011  80  of our trading volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result holders of our class a common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their method of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

the rights of our members including the board representation rights of the members of our cme exchange to elect six directors and the rights described in the immediately following risk factor could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and in the case of our class b shareholders and cbot members provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are also entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent we are also required to include at least 10 cbot directors as defined in our bylaws on our board until our 2012 annual meeting of shareholders and to submit changes to the rules and regulations of the cbot exchange to the cbot directors in advance for their review in the event the cbot directors determine in their sole discretion that a proposed rule change will materially impair the business of cbot or the business opportunities of the holders of the cbot memberships such change must be submitted to a committee comprised of three cbot directors and two cme directors as defined in our bylaws in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to the operation of our open outcry trading facilities and certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

class b common stock 

our class b common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized overthecounter market each class of our class b common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our cme exchange cmes rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights each share of our class b common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights 

class b shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold or leased through our shareholder relations and membership services department although our class b shareholders have special voting rights because our class b shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our class a shares we expect that the market price of our class b common stock if reported separately from the associated trading rights would be determined by the value of our class a common stock   as of february 15 2012 there were approximately 1716  holders of record of our class b common stock 

dividends 

the following table sets forth the dividends we paid on our class a and class b common stock in the last two years 

  



on february 1 2012 our board approved a change in our annual dividend policy to increase the target from approximately 35 of the prior years cash earnings to approximately 50 of the prior years cash earnings in accordance with this policy we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders on february 1 2012  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 223  per share the decision to declare a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our future earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 300 per share the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined after the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year both dividends will be payable on march 26 2012  to shareholders of record on march 9 2012  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the total first quarter dividend payment for both dividends will be approximately 3458 million  

the indentures governing our floating and fixed rate notes our 364day clearing house credit facility for 30 billion and our new 10 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility entered into in 2011 do not contain specific covenants that 

restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

for example under our new senior credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of september 30 2010 after giving effect to actual share repurchases made and special dividends paid but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid after september 30 2010 and in no event greater than 20 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends during the term of the agreement multiplied by 065 in addition our 364day clearing house credit facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 3750 million 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries including cme in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

cme group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of their state of incorporation which could also limit its or their ability to declare and pay dividends 

stock repurchases 

on may 9 2011 the board of directors authorized a share buyback program of up to 7500 million  of class a common stock over a 12month period during 2011 we purchased a total of 08 million  shares at an average price of 272  per share

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend introduction 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is organized as follows 

 on march 18 2010 board of trade of the city of chicago inc cbot acquired a 90 ownership interest in cme group index services llc index services a joint venture with dow jones  company dow jones the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes the financial results of index services beginning march 19 2010 

references in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to cme group inc cme group and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively references to “exchange” are to chicago mercantile exchange inc cme cbot and new york mercantile exchange inc nymex collectively 

overview 

business structure 

cme group a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for cme cbot nymex and their respective subsidiaries the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme group also includes two clearing houses  cme clearing a division of cme and cme clearing europe limited cmece cme groups class a common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” 

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts we also clear futures options on futures and overthecounter contracts futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals we also clear overthecounter contracts on a range of product lines including interest rate swaps credit default swaps energy and agricultural commodities 

our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

our major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our cme clearing house 

our clearing houses clear settle and guarantee every futures and options contract traded through our exchanges in addition to cleared overthecounter products including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing houses as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract 

offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies 

to ensure performance of counterparties we establish and monitor financial requirements of our clearing firms we also establish minimum performance bond requirements for our exchangetraded products and overthecounter products for cme and cmece clearing firms we marktomarket all open positions at least twice a day and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value for select clearedonly markets positions are markedtomarket daily with the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant 

we maintain three separate financial safeguard packages for cme clearing firms one for futures and options one for cleared overthecounter credit default swap contracts and one for cleared overthecounter interest rate swap contracts in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply any assets of the defaulting clearing firm deposited with cme to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our surplus funds for futures and options contracts or our designated working capital for cleared overthecounter credit default swap contracts and cleared overthecounter interest rate swap contracts we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit surplus funds represent the amount of cme working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support normal operations and amounts designated by cme for our credit default swap and interest rate swap financial safeguard packages 

we maintain a separate financial safeguard package for cmece clearing firms in the unlikely event of a payment default by a cmece clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms performance bonds thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use 600 million of cmece funds as of december 31 2011 the guaranty fund contributions were contributed by cmece in 2012 the cmece clearing firms may be asked to contribute to the cmece guaranty fund and the size of the fund will be reviewed in light of the actual risk exposure once the cmece clearing firms contribute to the guaranty fund we would use at least 200 million of cmece funds in the event of a default 

industry trends 

economic environment our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite recent economic uncertainty and volatility in recent years trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the united states and european credit crisis fluctuations in the availability of credit variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the federal reserve bank’s continued zero interest rate policy we continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment  our industry is highly competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of recent regulatory reforms in the financial services industry competition is influenced by liquidity and transparency of the markets variability in fee structures breadth of product offerings including quality of new product development as well as efficient and innovative technology we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others as the market continues to evolve we have worked to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers 

regulatory environment  our operations as a derivatives exchange have historically been subject to extensive regulation as a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over recent years the doddfrank act was signed into law in july 2010 the doddfrank act is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchangetraded while we believe that the new regulations will provide opportunities for our business the new regulations are subject to extensive rulemaking by various regulators to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of the new legislation and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected we continue to actively participate in the rulemaking process with the goal that the final regulations serve the public interest foster competition and innovation and do not place the us financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage the financial services industry in europe is also undergoing similar regulatory reform which could result in 

additional regulation over our european operations 

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on leveraging our benchmark products enhancing our customer relations expanding our customer base advancing our clearing and trading technologies and deriving benefits from our integrated clearing houses as well as our scalable infrastructure we specifically focus our strategy on capitalizing on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes we believe that we can build on our competitive strengths by implementing the following strategies 

 primary sources of revenue 

clearing and transaction fees  a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privatelynegotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for contracts executed through our trading venues because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in trading volume in addition to the industry trends noted earlier our trading volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenues 

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts limits on fees and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

product mix we offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearedonly swap contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage trading volume upon introduction of new products 

venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading platform as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors privately negotiated transactions and cme clearport any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platform and cme clearport open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers executing trades through our electronic platform are charged fees for using the platform in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on all transactions privately negotiated transactions include block trades which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on cme globex or the trading floor clearport provides for the clearing of otc futures and options trades executed offexchange in addition to clearing fees there are other assessments on clearport transactions 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services access and communication fees and various services related to our exchange and building operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through thirdparty distributors 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotation trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

on march 18 2010 cbot and dow jones entered into an agreement to form index services index services was formed through the contribution of cbots market data business and dow jones index business index services generates market data and information services revenue through licensing of its trademark indexes as well as through calculation and distribution of its market data 

access and communication fees access and communication fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform to our market data vendors and to direct market data customers as well as charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services including our colocation initiative which was launched in january 2012 access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers revenue from communication fees is dependent on open outcry trading as a significant portion relates to telecommunications on our trading floors 

other revenues other revenues include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants we maintain three commercial buildings in chicagos central business district we rent retail and office space to third party tenants including exchange customers we also maintain office space in new york city that is rented to third party tenants including exchange customers all tenants pay market rates for rent revenues related to our real estate operations are generally affected by market rental rates lease renewals and business conditions in the financial services industry in which most of our tenants operate in june 2011 we announced that we are pursuing a sale and partial leaseback of the north and south buildings of cbot if the sale is completed other revenues from rent will decrease 

to further diversify the range of services we offer we have entered into processing and development agreements with other exchanges and service organizations for example in 2010 we entered into an agreement with bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa to develop a new multiasset class electronic trading platform for their customers we recognize revenue under this agreement as services are provided and when developed technology is delivered 

additionally other revenues include fees for administrating our interest earning facility ief program trade order routing and various services to members and clearing firms we offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various ief offerings these clearing firms receive interest income and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit in addition other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by gfx corporation gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that trades futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products other revenues also include gains on sales from various investments 

primary expenses 

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume licensing and other fee agreements and the majority of our employee bonuses do vary directly with trading volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee may adjust the target level of performance for material unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to stock options restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of options is derived using the blackscholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility the riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options granted the fair value of other awards is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices 

amortization of purchased intangibles this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings as well as other asset and business acquisitions intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships licensing agreements and leaserelated intangible assets 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets purchased as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

professional fees and outside services  this expense includes costs of consulting services provided for strategic and technology initiatives as well as legal and accounting fees this expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives and legal proceedings 

other expenses we incur additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include investments in debt and equity securities for operational and strategic purposes and financing activities 

 37 

securities gains and losses on trading securities in our nonqualified deferred compensation plans and dividend income from our strategic investments investment income is influenced by the availability of funds generated by operations market interest rates changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms as well as the amount of dividends distributed from our strategic investments 

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets derivative instruments revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price a hierarchy exists for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 

we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into a threelevel classification hierarchy classification is based on the reliability of inputs as follows 

 for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 20 in the notes to the consolidated 

financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is assessed for impairment using a twostep test in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions valuation techniques we use to measure fair value include the market approach and the income approach the market approach encompasses comparable data sets within our peer group and the income approach includes discounted cash flow measurements using a market discount rate our valuation techniques could yield variable results based on changes in assumptions such as the discount rate and longterm growth rate and forecasted revenue and expense in the third quarter of 2011 the company adopted newlyissued guidance on goodwill impairment testing the guidance permits companies to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill that may allow them to omit the annual twostep quantitative test 

indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference the estimate of the fair value of all intangible assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows in estimating the fair value management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as the discount rate longterm growth rate forecasted revenue and expenses and other factors such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment testing requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 

derivative investments  we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets changes in our derivatives fair values are recognized in earnings unless the instruments are accounted for as cash flow hedges for a derivative designated as a fair value hedge any gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change to the extent the hedge is effective together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged we record the effective portions of our derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the period during which the hedged item affects earnings the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss is transferred to the same line in the consolidated statements of income as the hedged item any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of income consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged 

revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing houses clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customers exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests occasionally market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment when these circumstances occur revenue is recognized as services are provided 

income taxes  calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a 

percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax such as municipal interest income and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs  certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized costs are capitalized for software projects that will result in significant new functionality and are generally expected to cost in excess of 05 million the amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible softwarerelated activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project completed internal use software projects as well as workinprogress projects are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets once complete the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software generally three years costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from year to year based on our technologyrelated business requirements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu for fair value measurement the asu provides clarity on existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 with no early adoption permitted we will adopt the disclosure requirements once the guidance becomes effective 

in june 2011 fasb issued an asu for presentation of comprehensive income the asu requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements and to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in the income statement and in the other comprehensive income statement the asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted in december 2011 fasb issued an asu that indefinitely deferred the reclassification adjustments presentation we will adopt the disclosure requirements once the guidance becomes effective 

in december 2011 fasb issued an asu for balance sheet offsetting disclosure requirements the asu requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the financial statements as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement the asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 and interim periods therein with retrospective application required we will adopt the disclosure requirements once the guidance becomes effective 

results of operations 

2011  financial highlights 

the comparability of our operating results for the periods presented is impacted by the formation of index services in march 2010 

the following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented 



 40 

 revenues 



clearing and transaction fees 

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our cme clearing house contract volume also includes clearedonly cme clearport contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction which involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fee revenues by total contract volume all amounts exclude our trakrs credit default swap interest rate swap and cmece contracts 



we estimate the following increases decreases in clearing and transaction fees based on change in total contract volume and change in average rate per contract during 2011  compared with 2010  and 2010  compared with 2009  



average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure including volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the relationship between average rate per contract and volume the change in revenues attributable to changes in each is only an 

approximation 

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume contract volume can be influenced by many factors including political and economic factors the regulatory environment and market competition 

from december 31 2011 through the date the financial statements were issued overall volume declined compared with 2011 the decrease in volume is attributable to lower volatility within the equity market as measured by the cboe volatility index as well as lower volatility in shortterm interest rates 



interest rate products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key interest rate products eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years   



in 2011 when compared with 2010 the overall increase in interest rate contract volume was attributable to volatility caused by a change in market expectations regarding shortterm and longterm interest rates tied to the federal reserves announcement in 2011 that it intends to maintain its zero interest rate policy through 2013 in addition volatility caused by the downgrade of the united states credit rating also contributed to an increase in overall volume midterm interest rate contract volume which includes eurodollar back 32 futures and 5year us treasury futures and options grew at a faster rate than shortterm contract volume because of a shift from contracts based on shortterm interest rates to midterm interest rates due to the continued zero interest rate policy through 2013 

we also believe that overall us treasury futures and options contract volume increased in 2011 when compared with 2010 due to institutional portfolio adjustments caused by the downgrade of the united states credit rating many institutional portfolios are required to maintain an average minimum overall credit rating when the us treasury credit rating was downgraded the institutional portfolios had to sell investments with lower credit ratings and buy more us treasuries in order to increase their average minimum overall credit rating in addition the growth in overall us treasury futures and options contract volume was attributable to increased demand for us treasury securities as a safe haven investment during the european credit crisis 

the overall growth in interest rate contract volume in 2011 when compared with 2010 was partially offset by a decrease in volume in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 we believe the decline in volume in the fourth quarter of 2011 was attributable to low interest rate volatility as well as the mf global bankruptcy as well as stronger seasonal factors in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010 

in 2010 when compared with 2009 overall interest rate product volume increased due to the overall improvement in the economic environment in 2010 following the credit crisis specifically in the second half of 2010 a continuing zero interest rate policy in the united states and the federal reserves announcement that it would buy additional us treasury securities to stimulate the economy led to changing expectations about interest rates as well as increased market participants use of these products the change in expectations contributed to an increase in volume for longerterm us treasury products which was only partially offset by slower growth in volume for shortterm eurodollar products 

we believe that the increase in overall eurodollar products volume in 2010 when compared with 2009 resulted from uncertainty surrounding the london interbank offered rate libor due to the european credit crisis throughout early 2010 in addition changing expectations about the federal reserves monetary policy led to increased volume for longerdated eurodollar products 

in 2010 when compared with 2009 we believe that the increase in us treasury note futures and options volume was attributable to the additional us treasury note issuance by the us government as well as rising intermediate and longterm interest rates during 2010 

equity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key equity products 



in 2011 when compared with 2010 an overall increase in volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index contributed to an increase in equity contract volume we experienced periods of high volatility within the equity markets during the third quarter of 2011 which we believe was attributable to the downgrade of the united states credit rating and the continuation of the sovereign debt crisis in europe we also experienced short periods of high volatility in may 2010 due to the start of the sovereign debt crisis in europe which we believe contributed to additional volume in 2010 in general equity products such as the emini nasdaq contracts that hedge market risks different than those of the emini sp 500 our most liquid equity product do not tend to benefit from macrolevel events or increased volatility to the same extent 

growth in equity products volume was relatively unchanged in 2010 when compared with 2009 we believe an improved economic outlook leading to increased investment in the equities market contributed to an increase in volume in 2010 this increase was offset by a decrease in volume attributable to a decline in average volatility for equity products as measured by the cboe volatility index in 2010 when compared with 2009 

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key foreign exchange products 



in 2011 when compared with 2010 foreign exchange contract volume remained at a consistent level we believe that intervention by the japanese central bank to control the yen foreign exchange rate and uncertainty about the euro as a result of the european credit crisis caused the market to move to safe haven currencies such as the australian dollar and the canadian dollar as a result euro and japanese yen contract volume decreased while australian dollar volume increased 

we believe that the increase in volume in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to the weakening of the euro and british pound compared with the us dollar uncertainty surrounding the euro following the european credit crisis contributed to increased volatility which led to increased trading volume for the euro products in 2010 when compared with 2009 we also believe that the strengthening of the yen compared with the us dollar contributed to an increase in volume in addition our crossselling efforts to market participants in other asset classes as well as increased global sales presence contributed to growth in volume 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products 



we believe that the yearoveryear increases in contract volume from 2009 to 2011 were attributable to a decline in supply due to various weather events including flooding drought and excessive heat the change in supply resulted in increased volatility and higher grain prices we also believe that the increase in volume resulted from increased demand for feedgrains caused by increased demand for cattle and other proteins in emerging markets 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products 



in 2011 when compared with 2010 we believe the increase in energy contract volume was attributable to increased price volatility within the energy market during the first quarter of 2011 we believe that increased volatility caused by changes in global supply and demand resulting from political unrest in the middle east in the first quarter of 2011 contributed to the increase in crude oil and refined products volume we also believe that increased volatility caused by weatherrelated events led to an increase in natural gas contract volume in 2011 

in 2010 when compared with 2009 we believe that the growth in energy contract volume was attributable to an improved economic outlook as well as increased liquidity within the energy futures market during the period we believe crude oil and refined products contract volume increased at a higher rate than natural gas contract volume due to an increase in volume generated from customers outside the united states as well as increased volatility in the crude oil and refined products market 

metal products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products 



the overall increase in metal contract volume from 2009 to 2011 was attributable to the increased investment in precious metals as an asset class due to high volatility and uncertainty within the financial markets we believe that there has been an increase in silver contract volume due to the greater use of silver as an alternative investment 

average rate per contract 

the average rate per contract decreased from 2009  to 2011  due to an increase in member trading volume which increased faster than nonmember trading in general members receive lower rates when compared with nonmembers 

in addition the average rate per contract decreased in 2010  compared with 2009  due to a lower portion of equity and energy products as a percentage of total volume compared with interest rate products as a percentage of volume equity products volume decreased by 4  and energy product volume decreased by 1  while interest rate product volume increased by 3  equity and energy products have higher fees compared with interest rate products 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2011  one firm represented 13  and one firm represented 12  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2010  one firm represented 13  and one firm represented 11  of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2009  should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firms trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm in 2011 mf global one of our largest clearing firms was placed into bankruptcy and we transferred all of their more than 30000 customer accounts to other futures commission merchants 

other sources of revenue 

revenues from index services contributed to an increase in market data and information services revenue from 2009  to 2011  in march 2010 we formed index services which contributed to an increase in revenues of 549 million in 2010  when compared with 2009  and an increase of 356 million in 2011  when compared with 2010  in addition revenues from index services which include revenue from market data and licensing increased in 2011  when compared with 2010  due to growth in assets under management which was driven by underlying index market performance 

an increase in the basic device monthly fee in 2010  also contributed to an increase in overall market data and information services revenues in 2010  when compared with 2009  the overall increase from 2009  to 2011  was partially offset by a decline in revenue due to a decrease in basic device counts resulting from costcutting initiatives at customer firms 

effective january 1 2012 users of our basic service will pay 70  per month for each device compared with 61 per month in 2011 and 2010 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented approximately 39  45  and 55  of our market data and information services revenue in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendors customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we substantially completed installations of equipment for customers in our colocation program which resulted in incremental revenue of 34 million  in 2011 when compared with 2010 colocation services launched on january 29 2012 

in the second quarter of 2011 we recognized a 98 million  gain on sale of certain index services assets related to one of its service offerings the gain contributed to the increase in other revenue in 2011  when compared with 2010  in addition in 2011 when compared with 2010 we generated incremental processing services revenue of 43 million  from various strategic 

relationships and incremental licensing fee revenue of 34 million  the increase in other revenues in 2011 when compared with 2010 was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of 44 million  generated from our agreement with bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa to develop a new multiasset class electronic platform because the initial development phase was completed in the third quarter of 2011 

other revenues increased in 2010  when compared with 2009  due to 107 million  of revenue generated from our agreement with bmfbovespa and incremental processing services revenue generated from various strategic relationships this was partially offset by a 63 million  decline in trading revenues generated by gfx corporation gfx resulting from lower trading activity and narrower trading margins 

expenses 



2011 compared with 2010 

operating expenses increased by 869 million  in 2011 when compared with 2010 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase in operating expenses 



salary increases and rising healthcare costs contributed to a rise in salaries benefits and employer taxes an increase in average headcount primarily due to the formation of index services and investment in strategic growth initiatives also contributed to an increase in expense in 2011 when compared with 2010 

expenses increased due to the mf global bankruptcy filing in the fourth quarter of 2011 which resulted in writeoffs of accounts receivable legal fees and loss on collateral posted by gfx and held by mf global in customer segregrated funds as well as a other related expenses 

stockbased compensation increased in 2011 due to the expense impact related to the september 2010 and 2011 grants 

marketing expenses increased in 2011 due primarily to new advertising initiatives 

a decrease in professional fees was attributable to the formation and integration of index services which occurred in the first quarter of 2010 

impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2010 on the goodwill and trade name related to our cma operations also contributed to a decrease in expenses in 2011 when compared with 2010 

2010 compared with 2009 

operating expenses increased by 1489 million  in 2010 when compared with 2009 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase in operating expenses 



the rise in salaries benefits and employer taxes was attributable to an increase in average headcount due to index services as well as salary increases and rising healthcare costs 

our improved performance relative to our 2010 cash earnings target compared with 2009 relative to our 2009 cash earnings target led to the increase in our bonus expense 

impairment charges on goodwill and trade name related to our cma operations in the second quarter of 2010 led to an increase in expenses in 2010 

global expansion and establishment of strategic partnerships contributed to an increase in marketing and travel expenses in 2010 

the increase in expenses in 2010 was also due to professional fee expenses incurred for index services this increase included 103 million of professional and legal fees incurred for the formation of index services 

nonoperating income expense 

  



  

nm not meaningful 

investment income the decrease in investment income during 2011 when compared with 2010 was due to a decline in gains on marketable securities related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans of 41 million  gains and losses from these nonqualified deferred compensation plan securities are offset by an equal amount of compensation and benefits expense in addition we recognized a gain of 37 million from the sale of various equity and debt securities in 2010 which contributed to the decrease in investment income in 2011 when compared with 2010 the decrease in 2011 when compared with 2010 was partially offset by an increase in dividend income from our investment in bmfbovespa total overall dividend income was 349 million  in 2011 compared with 319 million  in 2010 

the increase in investment income in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to a 160 million increase in dividend income from our investments in bmfbovespa tmx group inc and bolsa mexicana de valores sab de cv and a 37 million gain resulting from the sale of various equity and debt securities the increase was partially offset by a 48 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates 

impairment of longterm investments in 2010 we determined that our investment in onechicago was impaired based on its historical financial performance and other factors as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 22 million 

in 2009 we determined that our investment in dme was impaired due to the excess of our carrying value over our investments estimated fair value as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 236 million we also determined that our investment in imarex asa imarex was impaired due to an extended and significant decline in the market price of its stock as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 224 million in 2009 

gains losses on derivative investments  in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recognized an 86 million loss due to ineffectiveness on the interest rate swap contract used to hedge interest rate risk on our term loan both the swap contract and the term loan were originally scheduled to expire in august 2011 in december 2010 we approved a plan to refinance the term loan in january 2011 resulting in ineffectiveness of the hedge 

additionally in march 2010 we recognized a 60 million gain on derivative investments as a result of a settlement from the lehman brothers holdings inc lehman bankruptcy proceedings the settlement related to an unsecured claim against lehman as counterparty to an overthecounter put option contract we purchased to hedge our risk of changes in the fair value of bmfbovespa stock resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the brazilian real 

interest and other borrowing costs  interest expense decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to repayment of the 4205 million term loan in january 2011 and the maturity of the 3000 million floating rate notes in august 2010 the decrease in 2011 compared with 2010 was partially offset by the issuance in march 2010 of 6125 million of 440 fixed rate notes which are due in 2018 

in 2010 when compared with 2009 interest expense increased due to the issuance of 6125 million of 440 fixed rate notes due 2018 this resulted in an increase in average effective yield and total cost of borrowing however average debt balances decreased in 2010 due to the reduction in overall debt levels throughout the year the increase in expense was also attributable to a full year of interest expense recognized on the 575 fixed rate notes issued in february 2009   



total cost of borrowing includes interest commitment fees discount accretion and debt issuance costs 

guarantee of exercise rights privileges  in december 2009 final approval of the settlement of the erps associated with our cbot holdings merger occurred and we reduced our liability associated with our guarantee of the erps to zero which resulted in a gain in 2009 following the resolution of the lawsuit we also adjusted the value of the 159 erps that we held to the expected settlement value which also contributed to the gain in 2009 

other income expense in 2009 we recognized income and expense related to the nymex securities lending program which was terminated in june 2009 

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 

  



in 2011 when compared with 2010 the decrease in our effective tax rate was the result of a reduction in state tax apportionment which resulted in a reduction in our income tax provision of 6460 million  including a 5279 million decrease in the income tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2011 largely due to a revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities additionally in the first quarter of 2011 we began marking to market our investment in bmfbovespa which resulted in a 488 million  reduction in valuation allowances on other unrealized capital losses previously reserved 

the increase in the effective tax rate in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to a 512 million  charge to record the 

impact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing deferred tax liabilities the state and local tax rate increased due to revised state apportionment estimates resulting from annual state tax filings the increase in the effective tax rate was also due to the impairment of cmas goodwill and trade name in the second quarter of 2010 which was not deductible 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements  we have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations while our cost structure is fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are dependent on trading volume levels we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments however it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2011  these were as follows 

  

 operating leases include rent payments for office space in chicago and other smaller offices in the united states and in various foreign countries the operating lease for our headquarters in chicago expires in november 2022 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 101 million  to 135 million  we also maintain an operating lease for additional office space in chicago which expires in november 2023 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 45 million  to 62 million  

purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to purchase software licenses hardware and maintenance as well as telecommunication services other longterm liabilities include primarily funding obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans as well as contingent consideration 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through investment in our colocation program increased system capacity and performance improvements each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data centers telecommunications network and other operating equipment in 2012  we expect capital expenditures to total between 1400 million  and 1500 million  we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders the decision to pay a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant cme group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its or their ability to declare and pay dividends on february 1 2012 our board approved a change in our annual dividend policy to increase the distribution target from approximately 35 of the prior years cash earnings to approximately 50 of the prior years cash earnings on february 1 2012  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 223  per share the board of directors also declared an additional annual variable dividend of 300 per share going forward this dividend will be considered in the first quarter of each year and will supplement the regular dividend the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined after the end of each year and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year both dividends will be payable on march 26 2012  to shareholders of record on march 9 2012  assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payments will total approximately 3458 million  

sources and uses of cash  the following is a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly in 2011 when compared with 2010 increased profitability as a result of higher trading volumes was offset by an increase in other current assets and other assets resulting from an increase in restricted cash in 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was 4681 million  lower than net income which was attributable to a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities partially offset by amortization of purchased intangibles of 1320 million  and depreciation and amortization of 1285 million  

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 when compared with 2009 was due to higher trading volumes and increased profitability in 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was 4043 million  higher than net income this increase was the result of depreciation and amortization expense of 1299 million  and amortization of purchased intangibles of 1281 million  an increase in accrued expenses also contributed to the overall increase 

investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2011 when compared with 2010 was due to the proceeds from the sale of a longterm investment and our erps in 2010 

the termination of the nymex securities lending program in 2009 as well as the decrease in proceeds from marketable securities net of purchases of 2782 million  contributed to the increase in cash used for investing in 2010 when compared with 2009 

financing activities 

the increase in cash used in 2011 compared with 2010 was attributable to proceeds from our issuance of shares to bmfbovespa in 2010 and an increase in cash dividends in 2011 when compared with 2010 the increase was partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases of 3549 million  in 2011 when compared with the same period in 2010 

the decrease in cash used in 2010 relative to 2009 was attributable to a decrease in commercial paper repayments net of proceeds and proceeds from our share issuance to bmfbovespa in 2010 we also terminated the nymex securities lending program in 2009 which resulted in a decrease in the nymex securities lending program liabilities the decrease was partially offset by an increase in share repurchases of 5483 million  in 2010 share repurchases increased in an effort to offset most of the dilution associated with the issuance of shares to bmfbovespa 

debt instruments  the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2011  



 we maintain a 10 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions the proceeds from the revolving senior credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes   which includes providing liquidity for our cme clearing house in certain circumstances and if necessary for maturities of commercial paper  as long as we are not in default under the new senior credit facility we have the option to increase the facility up to 18 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds the senior credit facility matures in january 2014 and is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty under our credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2011  consisted of fixed rate borrowings of 21 billion  we did not have any variable rate borrowings as of december 31 2011  

credit risk 

our clearing houses act as the counterparties to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through thirdparty exchanges and overthecounter markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including our clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for our exchangetraded and overthecounter products including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps for futures and options on futures we typically establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk for cleared overthecounter credit default and interest rate swaps we typically establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk for cmece clearing firms we typically establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 95 to 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements is charged at a discount rate to cover at least 99 of expected price and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a historical period discount rates vary depending on the type of collateral we marktomarket all open positions of cme and cmece clearing firms at least twice a day and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value for select clearedonly markets positions are markedtomarket daily with the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant these practices allow our clearing houses to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions this transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity we maintain three separate financial safeguard packages for our cme clearing firms one for futures and options one for cleared overthecounter credit default swap contracts and one for cleared overthecounter interest rate swap contracts in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our surplus funds for futures and options contracts or our designated working capital for cleared overthecounter credit default swap contracts and cleared overthecounter interest rate swap contracts we would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit surplus funds represent the amount of cme working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support normal operations and amounts designated by cme for our credit default swap and interest rate swap financial safeguard packages 

we maintain a 30 billion 364day fully secured committed line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our cme clearing house we have the option to request an increase in the line from 30 billion to 50 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit such as clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as select money market mutual funds approved for our select ief programs performance bond collateral of a defaulting 

clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day fully secured committed line of credit we also have the option to use our 10 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default 

aggregate performance bond deposits for cme clearing firms for futures and options cleared overthecounter credit default swap contracts and cleared overthecounter interest rate swap contracts was 925 billion  including 81 billion  of cash performance bond deposits a defaulting firms performance bond collateral can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm

the following shows the available assets of our cme clearing house for the interest rate swap financial safeguard package at december 31 2011  in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears interest rate swap contracts after first utilizing the defaulting firms available assets 



 we maintain a separate financial safeguard package for cmece clearing firms in the unlikely event of a payment default by a cmece clearing firm we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firms performance bonds aggregate cash performance bond deposits for cmece clearing firms was 260 million  there were no noncash performance bonds on deposit at december 31 2011  thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied after first applying assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation we would use 600 million of cmece funds as of december 31 2011  guaranty fund contributions were contributed by cmece in 2012 the cmece clearing firms may be asked to contribute to the cmece guaranty fund and the size of the fund will be reviewed in light of the actual risk exposure once the cmece clearing firms contribute to the guaranty fund we would use at least 200 million of cmece funds in the event of a default 

despite these safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk resulting from our operations is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of total assets and liabilities we report in our consolidated balance sheets the financial statements of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in various currencies including the british pound and the brazilian real and are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity the translation adjustment net of tax for 2011  2010  and 2009  was 833 million  05 million  and 26 million  respectively in 2011 we reversed an unrealized loss of 817 million net of tax which was attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss upon recognizing impairment on our investment in bmfbovespa 

at december 31 2011  and 2010  3  and 10  of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balances were held by foreign subsidiaries whose balance sheets were translated from a foreign functional currency to us dollars at each reporting date 

other foreign currency risk 

we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to the equity investments noted under equity price risk any foreign exchange rate risk related to these investments is reflected in the equity price risk section below 

foreign currency risk related to customer collateral 

a portion of the performance bond deposits is denominated in foreign currency we mark to market all collateral once daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price in 

addition we typically establish performance bond levels to cover at least 95 to 99 of expected price and foreign currency changes for a given product within a given historical period which further reduces our exposure to foreign currency and other price risk collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements is charged at a discount rate to cover at least 99 of expected price and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a historical period discount rates vary depending on the type of collateral therefore our exposure to foreign currency risk related to customer collateral deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results 

equity price risk 

we hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded at their fair value fair values for publiclytraded equity investments are based on quoted market prices fair values are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 

the table below summarizes our equity investments subject to equity price fluctuation at december 31 2011  equity investments are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 



we do not currently hedge against equity price risk equity investments are assessed for otherthantemporary impairment on a quarterly basis an assessment of whether an equity investment is otherthantemporarily impaired takes into consideration the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss at december 31 2011  we determined that none of the equity investments listed above were otherthantemporarily impaired

our competitive strengths 

cme group offers a number of key differentiating elements that set it apart from its competitors including 

highly liquid markets —our listed markets provide an effective and transparent forum for our customers to manage their risk and meet their investment needs relating to our markets we believe that our customers choose to trade on our centralized market due to its liquidity and transparency market liquidity or the ability of a market to absorb the execution of large purchases or sales quickly and efficiently is key to attracting customers and contributing to a market’s success 

most diverse product line —our products provide a means for hedging speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with among other things interest rate sensitive instruments equity ownership changes in the value of foreign currency credit risk and changes in the prices of commodities the estimated percentage of clearing and transaction fees revenue contributed by each product line is as follows 

 

 the breadth and diversity of our product line is beneficial to our overall performance when an individual product line is impacted by macroeconomic factors for example the impact to our interest rate product line due to the credit crisis and the federal reserve bank’s zero interest rate policy was partially offset by trading volume in our other product lines 

our products are traded through the cme globex electronic trading platform our open outcry auction markets in chicago and new york city and through privately negotiated transactions that we clear the estimated percentage of clearing and transaction fees revenue contributed by each trading venue is as follows 

 

 our products generate valuable information regarding trading activity we distribute our market data over the cme market data platform directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets and 

  

to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges other thirdparty data providers and news sources and then resell their consolidated data the estimated contributions of our market data and information services products based on percentage of total revenue over the last three years was 11 in 2010 13 in 2009 and 11 in 2008 

we believe our new joint venture with dow jones entered into in march 2010 will allow us to expand our index and market data offerings providing for further revenue diversification and will allow us to reach new customers in both the institutional and retail market segments in 2010 we derived 2 of our revenues from the business acquired from dow jones 

safety and soundness of our markets —we understand the importance of ensuring that our customers are able to manage and contain their trading risks as the markets and the economy have evolved we have worked to adapt our clearing services to meet the needs of our customers we believe security can best be delivered to the marketplace through adherence to the following key principles 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we own and operate our own clearing house within our cme exchange in addition the fsa approved cme clearing europe as a recognised clearing house we expect cme clearing europe to launch in the first half of 2011 

our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and soundness of our markets our clearing services protect the financial integrity of our markets by serving as the counterparty to every trade becoming the buyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer and limiting credit risk the clearing house is responsible for settling trading accounts clearing trades collecting and maintaining performance bond funds regulating delivery and reporting trading data cme clearing marks open positions to market at least twice a day and requires payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value for select product offerings with newer markets positions are markedtomarket daily with the capacity to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant we also offer clearing services through cme clearport a comprehensive set of flexible clearing services for the global overthecounter market backed by cme clearing see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” beginning on page 62 and “item 1a risk factors” beginning on page 18 for more information on our financial safeguards package and the associated credit risks related to our clearing services

our strategic initiatives 

the following is a description of our strategic initiatives 

leading core business innovation —we plan to continue to launch new products expand on the strength of our existing benchmark products and enhance our customer relations to allow us to further crosssell our products for example in 2010 we launched over 200 new products which included the expansion of our existing product lines by among other things launching our ultralong bond treasury futures and options and our ontherun treasury futures products these products create an array of new trading opportunities for our market participants as well as provide new tools for our customers who lack easy access to the us treasury securities and repo markets 

globalizing our company and our business —our goal is to expand and diversify our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world the most broadly diversified portfolio of benchmark products we are focusing on core growth in global markets because we believe that asia latin america and other emerging markets will experience superior economic and financial markets growth over the next decade compared with the more mature north american and european markets 

many of our products are global benchmarks that appeal to customers both domestically and internationally in 2010 we supplemented our foreign product suite with the addition of the nifty 50 emicro and emini futures the us dollar denominated crude palm oil futures fx index futures and an expanded suite of energy products based on european and asian price assessments to further enhance our customers’ trading opportunities we have partnered with leading exchanges around the world to make their products available on or through our cme globex platform and network these arrangements allow our customers to access five of the world’s most actively traded equity futures contracts—brazilian ibovespa index futures korean kospi 200 index futures indian nifty 50 index futures japanese nikkei 225 index futures and will include the mexican ipc index futures as a result of our linkage with bolsa mexicana de volares additionally in 2010 we expanded on our existing strategic partnership with bmfbovespa pursuant to which we will develop a new multiasset class electronic trading platform that will be deployed by bmfbovespa for use in its own cash equities and derivatives markets and both of us will have the ability to license the platform to other exchanges internationally these relationships were in addition to our existing key strategic relationships with bursa malaysia derivatives dubai mercantile exchange johannesburg stock exchange the green exchange and singapore exchange these partnerships allow us to accelerate our market penetration expand our customer reach and develop product sales channels with local brokers 

cme clearing europe based in london is our first nonus clearing house in december 2010 cme clearing europe was approved as a recognised clearing house by the fsa and will offer multiasset class overthecounter clearing services and build on our european presence to further extend the geographical reach of our clearing services we expect the clearing house to launch in the first half of 2011 

  

leading our industry in customer service education and training and sales support —to ensure that we are providing our customers with effective service we recently restructured our global client development and sales organization to better target cross asset sales across client segments drive international sales specifically in asia and europe and to generate new client participation across all regions in 2010 we increased our headcount by approximately 4 to support key locations outside the united states to better serve our customers on a global basis including adding additional product heads who are based overseas we have also enhanced our educational resources on our products and services to assist our customers in achieving their trading and risk management goals for example our efforts include hosting agricultural product training courses focused in latin america and the united states hosting customer and university groups for simulated trading and floor tour events developing a wide range of online tutorials demos strategy papers and hedging guides and hosting trading competitions with participation from universities 

extending our capabilities and business in the overthecounter markets —our goal is to provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the market for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to a single clearing house our overthecounter offerings provide the extensive counterparty risk reduction and transparency of cme clearing while preserving the prevailing execution processes technology platforms and economic structures currently in use in the marketplace we offer clearing services for cleared overthecounter derivatives including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps our cleared interest rate swap offering provides our customers with the ability to negotiate execute and submit trades through multiple approved tradecapture platforms cme clearport offers an array of clearing services that depend on the nature of the product traded it has the capacity to clear and report transactions in multiple asset classes in 2010 we added approximately 185 products to our cme clearport system 

establishing ourselves as the leading exchange company provider of information products and index services —we offer a variety of market data services for the futures equities and the overthecounter markets in 2010 we expanded our index services business through the formation of cme group index services with dow jones we expect that this venture will allow us to bring the dow jones’ brand and index creation and calculation capabilities to current and prospective banking clients and exchange partners provide additional crosslisting opportunities and new global opportunities for index creation calculation and licensing in cash derivatives and overthecounter markets globally allow us to crosssell and cobrand products and expand market data dissemination services to our global network of clients and exchange partners

we offer equity index futures and options on key benchmarks including sp nasdaq dow jones and nikkei indexes we also have an agreement with the chicago board options exchange cboe to allow us to list futures and options on futures for volatility indexes on a variety of asset classes with the exception of dow jones these products are listed by us subject to license agreements with the applicable owners of the indexes we have exclusive arrangements with standard  poor’s sp and the nasdaq omx group inc nasdaq and nonexclusive arrangements with the other third parties our rights to the dow jones indexes previously were evidenced by an exclusive agreement but are now part of our ownership of the joint venture our sp license is exclusive through 2016 and nonexclusive from that date until 2017 with some exceptions provided certain 

  

trading volume is achieved our nasdaq license is exclusive through 2019 copies of our sp and nasdaq license arrangements have been filed as material contracts we also have a licensing and membership agreement with bba enterprises limited and the british bankers’ association collectively bba for the use of its london interbank offered rate to settle several of our interest rate products including our eurodollar contract for our licensing arrangements other than with bba we pay the applicable third party per trade fees based on trading volume for the bba license we paid an upfront fee and an annual fee 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with sp and nasdaq or be able to maintain our other existing licensing arrangements in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments including securities and options based on the sp nasdaq or dow jones indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond the jurisdictional reach of us andor our licensors for example we are a party to a pending legal matter seeking a declaratory judgment that the opposing party is required to obtain a valid license in order to list certain products based upon the dow jones and sp indexes while we have prevailed on a motion for summary judgment the matter is currently pending appeal a negative decision in the matter would have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenues from our index services business 

seasonality 

generally we have historically experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters however such seasonality may also be impacted by general market conditions such as the 2008 economic crisis during 2010 23 of our consolidated revenues were recognized in the first quarter 27 in the second quarter 25 in the third quarter and 25 in the fourth quarter 

working capital 

until we began our commercial paper program in mid2007 we historically met our funding requirements with internally generated funds for more information on our working capital needs see “management’s discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition—liquidity and capital resources” beginning on page 57 which section is incorporated herein by reference 

customer base 

our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments our customers can access our cme globex trading platform across the globe customers may be members of one or more of our exchanges rights and privileges of membership are exchange specific trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by our members membership on one of our futures exchanges also enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections in 2010 79 of our trading volume was conducted by our members 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13 and one firm represented 12 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2010 should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the enactment of the doddfrank act doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry as discussed in the following section for example doddfrank provides for central clearing of “clearable” overthecounter swaps and requires that swaps that are cleared must be traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities unless no exchange or swap execution facility makes the swap available for trading while these new requirements create opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter business a number of market participants and other exchanges have developed and likely will develop in the future competing platforms and products 

we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others 

competition in our derivatives business 

we believe competition in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs 

we are beginning to see a wave of consolidation and increased competition for example nyse euronext and deutsche bourse announced in february 2011 that they had entered into a merger agreement tmx group and the london stock exchange also recently announced their agreement to merge previously in 2010 the singapore stock exchange announced its proposed acquisition of the australian stock exchange at the end of 2010 there were approximately 60 futures exchanges located in approximately 30 countries additionally there has been an increase in activity among derivative dealers banks and other entities to form competing exchanges for example in 2007 a consortium of 12 financial institutions formed an exchange electronic liquidity exchange elx which began trading in july 2009 elx’s initial product line included electronic trading in us treasury futures in the two five and tenyear notes and thirtyyear bond contracts in competition with cbot’s treasury complex and has been expanded to include eurodollars elx has requested that the cftc compel 

  

cbot to accept certain noncompetitive trades as a means to permit two customers with equal and opposite positions at cbot to transfer those positions to elx in august 2010 the cftc issued a letter stating that it did not find that these transactions referred to as “exchange for futures” were wash trades and that such transactions were not prohibited by the cftc’s core principles or applicable regulations the cftc also indicated that it would separately review cbot’s response under the core principle relating to anticompetitive behavior at this time however the cftc has not required us to take any action or modify our existing rules we also face competition from intercontinentalexchange’s ice energy index natural gas credit default swaps equity index foreign exchange and other products our metal product offerings also compete with nyse euronext new entrants into our industry including new york portfolio clearing discussed below may further increase competitive pressure on us 

because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets we also compete with nyse euronext and other securities and options exchanges dealer markets and alternative trading systems as well as with ice in connection with its futures and options on futures contracts based on the russell indexes 

we face competition from the overthecounter market with the trading of contracts similar to those traded or cleared on our exchanges such as swaps forward contracts and other exchange “lookalike” contracts in which parties directly negotiate the terms of their contracts as well as from spot markets etfs and other substitutes for our products 

competition in our transaction processing business 

in addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services and we expect competition to continue to increase in connection with the implementation of doddfrank which will require the mandatory central clearing of standardized overthecounter products 

for example ice has its own clearing operations which are comprised of regulated clearing houses across the united states europe and canada in march 2009 ice trust which provides clearing services for the credit default swap market acquired the clearing corporation the options clearing corporation provides clearing services for commodity futures commodity options and security futures including products listed by elx in 2009 nyse euronext and the depository trust  clearing corporation announced the creation of a new clearing house for the clearing of fixedincome securities—new york portfolio clearing in february 2010 new york portfolio clearing was granted status as a designated clearing organization from the cftc it is currently awaiting approval from the sec it plans to clear interest rate products traded on nyse liffe us nyse’s futures exchange with the ability to expand to additional exchanges in the future we believe that other exchanges may also undertake to provide clearing services 

we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the cost of the services provided performance bond requirements quality and reliability of the services timely delivery of the services reputation offering breadth confidentiality of positions and information security protective measures and the value of linking with existing products markets and distribution 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent potential competitors because as purveyors of market data or trading software systems these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities as technology firms they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks additionally technology and software firms that develop trading systems hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets this may lead to decreased demand for our market data 

  

regulatory matters 

our operation of futures exchanges is subject to extensive regulation by the cftc under its principlesbased approach which requires that our exchange subsidiaries satisfy the requirements of certain core principles relating to the operation and oversight of our markets and our clearing house the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the commodity exchange act and the commodity futures modernization act the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years which most recently occurred in 2008 

in light of the widespread financial and economic difficulties particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 there were calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets in july 2010 doddfrank was signed into law this new legislation is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchange traded doddfrank reinforces the core tenants of our markets 

 

  

  

  

  

 while we believe that the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we intend to explore doddfrank is subject to extensive rulemaking by the cftc the sec the department of treasury and other regulators cme group and others in the industry are actively participating in the rulemaking process with the goal that the new regulations serve the public interest foster competition and innovation and do not place the us financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage in our evolving financial markets however in light of the uncertainty of the final implementation of doddfrank there is a risk that the final regulations could include provisions that could negatively impact our business 

among the key provisions in doddfrank relating to our business which are being finalized in the rulemaking process are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 the financial services industry outside the united states is also undergoing similar significant reform particularly in europe for example in the united kingdom the government has proposed to reorganize its regulatory framework which would include the dissolution of the fsa with oversight to be transitioned to the bank of england the consumer protection and markets authority and the prudential markets authority depending upon the status of the regulated entity as a result in the united kingdom our operations could be subject to multiple regulators the european union is also undergoing similar reform with multiple supervisory authorities such as the european securities and markets authority esma being established as of january 2011 in addition to the national regulators esma is likely to have a supervisory and oversight role over european clearing houses noneuropean clearing houses and noneuropean exchanges providing services in europe multiple legislations such as the european market infrastructure regulation the markets in financial instruments directive and the market abuse directive have been proposed with provisions similar to those contained in dodd frank 

to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of doddfrank and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

as a global company with operations and locations around the world we are also subject to the laws and regulations in the locations in which we do business 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

additionally on may 6 2010 the prices of many usbased equity products experienced an extraordinarily rapid decline and recovery—referred to as the “flash crash” stemming from this event there has been an inquiry into the impact of high frequency traders on may 6 th as well as their future role in the markets although not clearly defined high frequency trading typically refers to professional traders acting in a proprietary capacity that engage in strategies that generate a large number of trades on a daily basis we believe that such trading plays an important role in the marketplace by making it more efficient and competitive for all market participants and such firms contribute significantly to our liquidity at this time however it is unclear whether these inquires will result in restrictions on the use of high frequency trading 

from time to time including in the currently proposed presidential budget a proposal to impose a transaction tax or user fee on futures trading has been put forth and discussed as a means to fund the cftc in the current environment the transaction tax has been discussed as a means to fund the increased budget the cftc has requested from congress in order to implement dodd frank in the past efforts to implement a transaction tax or user fee have not been successful although not specified if enacted we believe such a tax or user fee likely would apply to transactions done on regulated futures exchanges and swap execution facilities and increase the costs of doing business on such platforms this may discourage institutions and individuals from using futures andor swap contracts to manage their risks which could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level a transaction tax or user fee in the us may also cause market participants to increase their derivatives trading in jurisdictions outside the us which do not impose a comparable cost 

  

the current tax treatment for futures trading allows traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60 at capital gains rates and 40 at ordinary tax rates the current 2010 fiscal year presidential budget proposes the elimination of such tax treatment which would require that such gains or losses be treated as ordinary in character any repeal of the 6040 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to the individuals who contribute to creating liquid and efficient markets

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks that we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets our trading volume is directly affected by us domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically our trading volume has tended to increase during periods of heightened uncertainty due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however during the economic volatility that began in 2008 we have experienced decreased volume due primarily to our customers decreasing their risk exposure stable low interest rates and the lack of available capital as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful this trend as well as future economic uncertainty may result in continued decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business and such environment is currently undergoing significant reform 

our business has been extensively regulated by the cftc in response to the economic crisis in july 2010 doddfrank was signed into law this new legislation is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchange traded in accordance with doddfrank the cftc’s authority will be significantly expanded to include overthecounter derivatives while we believe that the new regulations provide opportunities for our business which we intend to explore doddfrank is subject to extensive rulemaking by the cftc the sec the department of treasury and other regulators in light of the uncertainty of the final implementation of 

  

doddfrank there is a risk that the final regulations could include provisions that could negatively impact our business for example doddfrank provides for certain restrictions on swap dealing and proprietary trading enhancements to the margin requirements and imposes position limits for particular energy metals and agricultural commodities to the extent these provisions negatively impact the trading activity of our customers our trading volumes and related revenues may be impacted 

doddfrank also provides for central clearing of “clearable” overthecounter swaps and requires that swaps that are cleared must be traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities unless no exchange or swap execution facility makes the swap available for trading while these new requirements create new opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter business a number of market participants and exchanges have developed and likely will develop in the future competing platforms and products we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or that our initiatives will be successful 

to the extent rulemaking stemming from dodd frank includes a more prescriptive regulatory approach our ability to efficiently operate our business could be impaired 

our subsidiaries cme clearing europe and cme marketing europe are also subject to the supervision and oversight of the fsa the regulatory environment in the united kingdom and the european union is undergoing significant reforms in connection with the oversight of the financial services industry and legislations similar to those included in doddfrank have been proposed 

to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of doddfrank and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

as a global company with operations around the world we are also subject to the laws and regulations in the locations in which we do business we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations we also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by these agencies 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

from time to time including in the currently proposed presidential budget a proposal to impose a transaction tax or user fee on futures trading has been put forth and discussed as a means to fund the cftc in the current environment the transaction tax has been discussed as a means to fund the increased budget the cftc has requested from congress in order to implement dodd frank in the past efforts to implement a transaction tax or user fee have not been successful although not specified if enacted we believe such a tax or user fee likely would apply to transactions done on regulated futures exchanges and swap execution facilities and increase the costs of doing business on such platforms this may discourage institutions and individuals from using futures andor swap contracts to manage their risks which could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level a transaction tax or user fee in the us may also cause market participants to increase their derivatives trading in jurisdictions outside the us which do not impose a comparable cost 

the current tax treatment for futures trading allows traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60 at capital gains rates and 40 at ordinary tax rates the current 2010 presidential budget proposes the elimination of such tax treatment which would require that such gains or losses be treated as ordinary in character any repeal of 6040 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to the individuals who are most responsible for creating liquid and efficient markets 

  

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

some of our largest clearing firms which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with the futures industry association and the department of treasury have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish or seek to use alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchanges even if they are not successful in their efforts the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets if any of these events occur our revenues and profits could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business will not survive 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify especially in light of the enactment of doddfrank and other reforms of the financial services industry for example doddfrank provides for central clearing of “clearable” overthecounter swaps and requires that swaps that are cleared must be traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities unless no exchange or swap execution facility makes the swap available for trading while these new requirements create opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter business a number of market participants and other exchanges have developed and likely will develop in the future competing platforms and products 

we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others 

we are beginning to see a wave of consolidation and increased competition for example in february 2011 nyse euronext and deutsche bourse announced that they had entered into a merger agreement tmx group and the london stock exchange also announced their agreement to merge previously in 2010 the singapore stock exchange announced its proposed acquisition of the australian stock exchange at the end of 2010 there were approximately 60 futures exchanges located in approximately 30 countries additionally there has been an increase in activity among derivatives dealers banks and other entities to form competing exchanges for example in 2007 a consortium of 12 financial institutions formed an exchange elx to enter the futures market which began trading in july 2009 elx’s initial product line included electronic trading in us treasury futures in the two five and tenyear notes and thirtyyear bond contracts in competition with cbot’s treasury complex and has been expanded to include eurodollars elx has requested that the cftc compel cbot to accept certain noncompetitive trades as a means to permit two customers with equal and opposite positions at cbot to transfer those positions to elx in august 2010 the cftc issued a letter stating that it did not find that exchange for futures were wash trades and that such transactions were not prohibited by the cftc core principles or applicable regulations the cftc also indicated that it would separately review cbot’s response 

  

under the core principle relating to anticompetitive behavior at this time however the cftc has not required us to take any action or modify our existing rules we also face competition from ice’s energy index natural gas credit default swaps equity index foreign exchange and other products from nyse euronext and the depository trust  clearing corporation due to their creation of a new clearing house for the clearing of fixedincome derivatives as well as the options clearing corporation which provides clearing services for commodity futures commodity options and security futures including products listed by elx new entrants into our industry may further increase competitive pressure on us 

we believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies the number of businesses providing internetrelated financial services is rapidly growing other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may become competitive with us through acquisitions federal law allows institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar products to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can in addition our competitors may 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

a decline in our fees or any loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

changes in regulations as a result of the implementation of the doddfrank act and other restructuring of the regulation of the global financial markets or otherwise may adversely impact our ability to compete especially on a global basis 

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution facilities our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13 and 

  

one firm represented 12 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2010 should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange additionally from time to time certain customers may represent a significant portion of the open interest in our individual product lines or contracts if we fail to maintain our trading volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or we lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of trading volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected furthermore declines in trading volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of trading volume 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial litigation risks while we generally are protected by our rules limiting liability for system failures and certain forms of negligence and by statutory limits on private causes of actions in cases where we have not behaved in bad faith we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide for example the bankruptcy examiner in connection with the lehman brothers bankruptcy raised the issue of whether our auction and the related transfer of lehman’s trading positions could be deemed fraudulent we continue to believe that we acted appropriately and that our actions are immune from liability under the regulations however there is no guarantee that we would be successful in defending this potential action or any other action brought in the future we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business for example the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on the world trade center resulted in the closing of nymex’s trading and clearing operations for four business days and rendered its backup data and recovery center inoperable while we have undertaken significant measures to develop business continuity plans and to establish backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to our business 

the success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of successfully implement and maintain the electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity 

  

reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or our current or potential customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected additionally we rely on our customers’ ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled for example in 2010 an employee error resulted in errant trades inadvertently being placed into an active market environment which resulted in liability to the company of approximately 47 million we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy generally our goal is to design our systems to handle at least two times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities we could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems 

we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems including attacks from cybercriminals for example in 2010 a virus impacted email systems around the world including our system additionally there has been an increase in information security threats including malware targeted at specific entities while we have not been a specific target to date our role in the global marketplace could place us at greater risk persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by breaches although we intend to continue to implement security measures these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities 

  

we as well as many of our customers depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers’ trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform and other back office systems for their trade processing and risk management needs while these service providers have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that they will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers we could experience decreased trading volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties and the level of soundness of our clearing firms could adversely affect us 

our clearing house operations expose us to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely guarantee transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers as a result of the financial crisis that began in 2008 many financial institutions required additional capital infusions merged with larger and stronger institutions became bank holding companies that are regulated by the federal reserve bank and in some cases failed for example during 2008 the bear stearns companies inc lehman brothers holdings inc and american international group inc all of which were parent companies of clearing firms of our exchange experienced significant financial writedowns and in some cases failed although none of these cases resulted in a default of a clearing firm additional companies including our clearing firms may continue to encounter economic difficulties during this period of economic uncertainty 

as part of our overall growth initiatives we have expanded our clearing services to the overthecounter market in addition to standard futures and options on futures products including through cme clearport and our credit default and interest rate swap clearing initiatives the process for deriving margins and financial safeguards for overthecounter products is different and in part seeks to assess and capture different risks than our historical practices applied to our futures and options on futures products although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards for overthecounter products there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect market participants from the unique risks of these products 

we expect to begin operation of cme clearing europe during the first half of 2011 we have limited experience operating a clearing house outside of the united states 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to the clearing house and its margin and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cure any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect market participants from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

  

the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market 

to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit a certain amount of funds to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements with our clearing house as collateral for their trading activity we accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements including cash regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities us government agency securities letters of credit gold equities and foreign sovereign debt given the level of market volatility there is no guarantee that these investments will continue to maintain their value to the extent a clearing firm was not in compliance with these requirements it would be required to acquire additional funds decrease its proprietary trading activity andor transfer customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products 

our market data revenues may be reduced or eliminated by decreased demand overall economic conditions or the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems if we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we will experience a reduction in revenues 

we sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data and information services totaled 3951 million representing 13 of our total revenues and 3311 million representing 13 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively a decrease in overall trading volume may also lead to a decreased demand for our market data from the market data vendors for example in both 2010 and 2009 we experienced a decrease in the average number of market data devices due to the economic crisis continued high unemployment levels in the financial services sector and aggressive cost cutting initiatives at customer firms additionally electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate exchange fees for supplying market data to trading terminals if we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals we will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost market data revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees 

a key element of our strategy is to partner with other leading exchanges to provide them with transaction processing services our failure to derive value from our existing relationships or to identify future opportunities to provide these services may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business 

providing thirdparty transaction processing services is a key element of our strategy pursuant to transactionprocessing agreements we previously provided these services to nymex and to cbot prior to our acquisition of these companies we derived a significant amount of revenues from these service agreements we have entered into other transactionprocessing arrangements with bmfbovespa bolsa mexicana de valores the korea exchange the green exchange the dubai mercantile exchange and bursa malaysia derivatives we cannot assure you that such arrangements will be as profitable as our previous arrangements with nymex and cbot or that we will enter into additional agreements to provide processing services in the future our failure to capitalize on our existing arrangements and to identify future opportunities may have a negative impact on our ability to generate additional revenues and grow our business 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter market as discussed in the following risk factor and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources for example if we encounter limited resources we may be required to increase our expenses to obtain the necessary resources defer existing initiatives or not pursue certain opportunities we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions investments or 

  

other strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

there is no guarantee that our overthecounter initiatives will be successful 

our goal is to provide a comprehensive multiasset class clearing solution to the market for maximum operational ease and the capital efficiency that comes with connecting to a single clearing house we offer clearing services for cleared overthecounter derivatives including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps our strategy also includes extending our overthecounter services into other assets classes as well as enhancing our cme clearport functionality to support additional products while we believe doddfrank creates new opportunities for us to expand our overthecounter offerings the current regulatory environment for trading and clearing these products is uncertain we cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably in the event that future legislation or regulation adversely affects the trading of overthecounter products or reduces the demand for our offerings for example provisions within doddfrank include changes to the cftc’s core principles specifically core principal 9 which could require us to make modifications to the manner in which certain of our contracts trade andor require that such products be delisted as futures and relisted as swaps in addition a number of market participants and exchanges have developed competing platforms and products including ice’s offering for credit default swaps we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively or that our initiatives will be successful 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions investments and other strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of the increasing consolidation in our industry including the recently announced transactions between nyse euronext and deutsche bourse and tmx group and the london stock exchange as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us to the extent the trend of consolidation in our industry continues we may encounter increased difficulties in identifying growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration may also produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from strategic growth initiatives we have made or will make in the future which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results we may also be required to take an impairment charge in our financial statements relating to our acquisitions andor investments which could negatively impact our stock price 

expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our operations internationally including the launch of cme clearing europe directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 

   

  

  

  

 in addition as a result of our expanding global operations we are subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities including the fsa in connection with cme clearing europe and our marketing efforts in europe these may include laws rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business to date we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets we may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

generally the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which can be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees and agents including employees of gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that engages primarily in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures to generate liquidity could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents including our gfx employees also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions for example in 2010 an employee error resulted in errant trades inadvertently being placed into an active market environment which resulted in liability to the company of approximately 47 million 

  

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we own the rights to a large number of trademarks service marks domain names and trade names in the united states europe and other parts of the world we have registered many of our most important trademarks in the united states and other countries we hold the rights to a number of patents and have made a number of patent applications our patents cover match engine trader user interface trading floor support market data general technology and clearing house functionalities we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademarks copyright database rights trade secrets restrictions on disclosure and other methods notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and electronic execution services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we may still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 25 billion of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 09 billion 

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 

  

  

  

  

   

the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets over the last few years there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital 

our investment in bmfbovespa subjects us to investment and currency risk 

we own an interest in bmfbovespa representing approximately 5 of its outstanding shares which had a fair value of 7988 million as of december 31 2010 as an exchange its ability to maintain or expand its trading volume and operate its business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject additionally its stock is valued in brazilian real which subjects us to currency risk there is no guarantee that our investment in bmfbovespa will be profitable under the terms of the transaction we may not sell our shares in bmfbovespa until february 2012 

any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets or investments may result in material noncash writedowns and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

in connection with our acquisitions and investments including our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings we have recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by applying a fair value test looking at historical performance capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise over the past three years we have recorded impairment charges in connection with our investments in bmfbovespa imarex asa the dubai mercantile exchange fxmarketspace and onechicago and our acquisitions of swapstream and cma we may continue to experience future events that result in impairments the risk of impairment losses may increase to the extent our market capitalization and earnings decline an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results and could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our existing or future debt agreements 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

generally we have historically experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or 

  

nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure for example we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically than for trades executed on the trading floor in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability will be adversely affected 

twenty of our board members own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchanges as members these individuals may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their rights to elect directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

twenty of our directors own or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchange we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members in 2010 79 of our trading volume was derived from our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result holders of our class a common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their method of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their investment in our class a common stock if any 

the rights of our members including the board representation rights of the members of our cme exchange to elect six directors and the rights described in the immediately following risk factor could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and in the case of our class b shareholders and cbot members provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are also entitled to elect six directors to our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent we are also required to include at least 10 cbot directors as defined in our bylaws on our board until our 2012 annual meeting of shareholders and to submit changes to the rules and regulations of the cbot exchange to the cbot 

  

directors in advance for their review in the event the cbot directors determine in their sole discretion that a proposed rule change will materially impair the business of cbot or the business opportunities of the holders of the cbot memberships such change must be submitted to a committee comprised of three cbot directors and two cme directors as defined in our bylaws in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to the operation of our open outcry trading facilities and certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities tableend class a common stock 

our class a common stock is currently listed on nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” as of february 16 2011 there were approximately 3319 holders of record of our class a common stock 

the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of our class a common stock on a quarterly basis as reported on nasdaq 

 

 class b common stock 

our class b common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized overthecounter market each class of our class b common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our cme exchange cme’s rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights each share of our class b common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights 

class b shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold or leased through our shareholder relations and membership services department although our class b shareholders have special voting rights because our class b shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our class a shares we expect that the market price of our class b common stock if reported separately from the associated trading rights would be determined by the value of our class a common stock as of february 16 2011 there were approximately 1751 holders of record of our class b common stock 

dividends 

the following table sets forth the dividends we paid on our class a and class b common stock in the last two years 

 

 on january 5 2011 our board approved a change in our annual dividend policy to increase the target from approximately 30 of the prior year’s cash earnings to approximately 35 in accordance with this policy we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders the decision to declare a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our future earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant on february 23 2011 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 140 per share payable on march 25 2011 to shareholders of record on march 10 2011 assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the dividend payment will total approximately 936 million 

  

the indentures governing our floating and fixed rate notes our 364day clearing house credit facility for 10 billion and our new 10 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility entered into in 2011 do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

for example under our new senior credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of september 30 2010 after giving effect to actual share repurchases made and special dividends paid but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid after september 30 2010 and in no event greater than 20 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends during the term of the agreement multiplied by 065 in addition our 364day clearing house credit facility contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 125 million 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries including cme in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

cme group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of their state of incorporation which could also limit its or their ability to declare and pay dividends 

  

performance graph 

the following graph compares the cumulative fiveyear total return provided shareholders on our class a common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the sp 500 index and two customized peer groups the old peer group includes intercontinentalexchange inc nyse euronext and the nasdaq omx group inc the new peer group is the same as the old peer group with the addition of cboe holdings inc which completed its initial public offering in june 2010 an investment of 100 with reinvestment of all dividends is assumed to have been made in our class a common stock in the peer groups and the sp 500 index on december 31 2005 and its relative performance is tracked through december 31 2010

overview 

business structure 

cme group a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for cme cbot nymex and their respective subsidiaries the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme group’s class a common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” 

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearing overthecounter contracts futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

  

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals 

our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

our major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house 

our clearing house clears settles and guarantees every futures and options contract traded through our exchange in addition to cleared overthecounter products including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies 

to ensure performance of counterparties we establish and monitor financial requirements of our clearing firms we also establish minimum performance bond requirements for our exchangetraded products and overthecounter products we marktomarket all open positions at least twice a day and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value for product offerings within new markets positions are markedtomarket daily with the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant we maintain a financial safeguard package to be used in the event of default of a clearing firm for our futures options or cleared overthecounter credit default swap contracts in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm for our futures options or cleared overthecounter credit default swap contracts we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firm’s guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of a clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use in order cme’s surplus funds guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit surplus funds represent the amount of cme working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support normal operations and amounts designated by cme for our interest rate swap financial safeguard package 

we maintain a separate financial safeguard package to support our cleared overthecounter interest rate swap products this separate interest rate swaps financial safeguard package is independent of our financial safeguard package for our futures options or cleared overthecounter credit default swaps and is isolated to clearing firms for our interest rate swap products this financial safeguard package includes a separate guaranty fund risk committee and default management procedures we have also designated an additional 1000 million of cme working capital to be used in the event of default of one of the clearing firms for interest rate swap contracts after the defaulting clearing firm assets have been applied 

industry trends 

economic environment despite the recent economic volatility our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk over the last few years trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets fluctuations in the availability of 

  

credit variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the federal reserve bank’s continued zero interest rate policy we continue to maintain quality products and services which support our customers in any economic environment 

competitive environment we operate in a highly competitive industry and expect competition to continue to intensify especially after a recent consolidation of exchanges and new entrants to the markets we serve we encounter competition in all aspects of our business competition is influenced by liquidity and transparency of the markets variability in fee structures breadth of product offerings including quality of new product development as well as efficient and innovative technology we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others 

regulatory environment our operations as a futures exchange have historically been subject to extensive regulation in light of widespread difficulties across the economy particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets in july 2010 the doddfrank act was signed into law the doddfrank act is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets both overthecounter and exchangetraded while we believe that the new regulations will provide opportunities for our business the new regulations are subject to extensive rulemaking by various regulators to the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of the new legislation and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

business strategy 

our strategy focuses on leveraging our benchmark products enhancing our customer relations expanding our customer base advancing our clearing and trading technologies and deriving benefits from our integrated clearing house as well as our scalable infrastructure we specifically focus our strategy on capitalizing on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes we believe that we can build on our competitive strengths by implementing the following strategies 

 

  

  

  

 primary sources of revenue 

clearing and transaction fees a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privatelynegotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for contracts executed through our trading venues because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a 

  

percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in trading volume in addition to the industry trends noted earlier our revenues and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from uncertainty 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenues 

 

  

  

  

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we offer various incentive programs to promote trading in various products and geographic locations we may periodically change fees volume discounts limits on fees and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment for example we have an incentive program in place to provide fee incentives to international trading firms that trade our products electronically 

product mix we offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy and metals rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage trading volume upon introduction of new products 

trading venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading platform as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platform open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers executing trades through our electronic platform are charged fees for using the platform in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on all transactions privately negotiated transactions include block trades which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on cme globex or the trading floor 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

other sources revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services access and communication fees and various services related to our exchange and building operations 

market data and information services we receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through thirdparty distributors 

our service offerings include access to realtime delayed and endofday quotation trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

  

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

on march 18 2010 cbot and dow jones entered into an agreement to form index services index services was formed through the contribution of cbot’s market data business and dow jones’ index business index services generates market data and information services revenue through licensing of its trademark indexes as well as through calculation and distribution of its market data 

access and communication fees access and communication fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex platform to our market data vendors and to direct market data customers as well as charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services including our colocation initiatives access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers revenue from communication fees is dependent on open outcry trading as a significant portion relates to telecommunications on our trading floors 

other revenues other revenues include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants we maintain three commercial buildings in chicago’s central business district we rent retail and office space to third party tenants including exchange customers we also maintain office space in new york city that is rented to third party tenants including exchange customers all tenants pay market rates for rent revenues related to our real estate operations are generally affected by market rental rates lease renewals and business conditions in the financial services industry in which most of our tenants operate 

to further diversify the range of services we offer we have entered into processing and development agreements with other exchanges and service organizations prior to our merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 we collected fees from nymex for listing energy and metal futures products on the cme globex platform in 2010 we entered into an agreement with bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa to develop a new multiasset class electronic trading platform for their customers we recognize revenue under this agreement as services are provided and when developed technology is delivered 

additionally other revenues include fees for administrating our interest earnings facility ief program trade order routing and various services to members and clearing firms we offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various ief offerings these clearing firms receive interest income and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit in addition other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by gfx corporation gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that trades foreign exchange futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products 

primary expenses 

the majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume licensing and other fee agreements expense and the majority of our employee bonuses do vary directly with trading volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year 

  

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee may adjust the target level of performance for material unplanned revenue expense or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to stock options restricted stock and performance share grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted the fair value of options is derived using the blackscholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility the riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options granted the fair value of other awards is based on the share price on the date of the grant 

amortization of purchased intangibles this expense primarily includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings as well as other asset and business acquisitions intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships licensing agreements and leaserelated intangible assets 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets purchased as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software 

other expenses we incur additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include investments in debt and equity securities for operational and strategic purposes financing activities and our securities lending program 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding 

  

accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets derivative instruments revenue recognition income taxes and internal use software costs 

valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price a hierarchy exists for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 

we have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into a threelevel classification hierarchy classification is based on the reliability of inputs as follows 

 

  

  

 for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 24 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is assessed for impairment using a twostep test in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions valuation techniques we use to measure fair value include the market approach and the income approach the market approach encompasses comparable data sets within our peer group and the income approach includes discounted cash flow measurements using a market discount rate our valuation techniques could yield variable results based on changes in assumptions such as the discount rate and longterm growth rate and forecasted revenue and expense our annual impairment analysis indicated a fair value for cma that was below its book value as a result of adverse economic conditions accordingly in june 2010 a 198 million impairment loss was charged against earnings 

indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference the estimate of the fair value of all intangible assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows in estimating the fair value management must make assumptions 

  

and projections regarding such items as the discount rate longterm growth rate forecasted revenue and expenses and other factors such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 

intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances the impairment testing requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows if the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 

derivative investments we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets changes in our derivatives’ fair values are recognized in earnings unless the instruments are accounted for as hedges for a derivative designated as a fair value hedge any gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change to the extent the hedge is effective together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged we record the effective portions of our derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets when the hedged item affects earnings the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss is transferred to the same line in the consolidated statements of income as the hedged item any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of income consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged 

revenue recognition over 75 of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customer’s exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests occasionally market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment when these circumstances occur revenue is recognized as services are provided 

income taxes calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax such as municipal interest income and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized costs capitalized are for application development or implementation for software projects that will result in significant new functionality 

  

and that are generally expected to cost in excess of 05 million the amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible softwarerelated activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project completed internal use software projects as well as workinprogress projects are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets once complete the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software generally three years costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from year to year based on our technologyrelated business requirements 

results of operations 

2010 financial highlights 

the comparability of our operating results for the periods presented is significantly impacted by our merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 as well as the creation of index services in march 2010 in the discussion and analysis that follows we have quantified the incremental revenue or expense resulting from the nymex transaction wherever such amounts were material and identifiable while identified amounts may provide indications of general trends the analysis cannot completely address the effects attributable to integration efforts 

the following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

revenues 

 

 clearing and transaction fees 

the following table summarizes our total contract volume revenue and average rate per contract total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house contract volume also includes clearedonly cme clearport contracts volume is measured in round turns which is considered a completed transaction which involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fee revenue by total contract volume all amounts exclude our trakrs hurlo swapstream credit default swaps and interest rate swaps 

 

 we estimate the following increases decreases in clearing and transaction fees based on change in total volume and change in average rate per contract 

 

 average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure which includes volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the relationship between average rate per contract and volume the change in revenues attributable to changes in each is only an approximation 

  

contract volume 

the following table summarizes average daily contract volume nymex product and cme clearport services volume in 2008 have been calculated for the period from august 23 through december 31 2008 

 

 interest rate products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key interest rate products 

 

 the increase in overall interest rate product volume in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to the overall improvement in the economic environment in 2010 following the credit crisis specifically in the second half of 2010 a continuing zero interest rate policy in the united states and the federal reserve’s announcement that it will buy additional us treasury securities to stimulate the economy led to changing expectations about interest rates as well as increased market participants’ use of these products the change in expectations contributed to an increase in volume for longerterm us treasury products which was only partially offset by slower growth in volume for shortterm eurodollar products 

we believe that the increase in overall eurodollar products volume in 2010 when compared with 2009 resulted from uncertainty surrounding the london interbank offered rate libor due to the european credit crisis throughout early 2010 in addition changing expectations about the federal reserve’s monetary policy led to increased volume for longerdated eurodollar products 

in 2010 when compared with 2009 we believe that the increase in us treasury note futures and options volume was attributable to the additional us treasury note issuance by the us government as well as rising 

  

intermediate and longterm interest rates in early 2010 we introduced the ultra us treasury bond contract which generated an average of 31000 contracts per day since launch 

we believe that the decrease in eurodollar products volume in 2009 when compared with 2008 was attributable to the zero interest rate policy and increased risk aversion by market participants following the credit crisis within the united states we believe this reduced certain customers’ ability or need to assume and maintain positions during 2009 

we believe that the overall decline in us treasury note futures and options volume in 2009 when compared with 2008 was attributable to the credit crisis within the united states which resulted in reduced corporate debt issuances reduced mortgage issuances and refinancing activity a slowdown in the us treasury cash market trading as well as the federal reserve bank’s purchase of us treasury securities the decline in 2009 when compared with 2008 was also attributable to the zero interest rate policy which we believe reduced market participants’ need to hedge interest rate risk 

equity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key equity futures and options products 

 

 in 2010 when compared with 2009 growth in equity products volume was relatively flat we believe an improved economic outlook leading to increased investment in the equities market contributed to an increase in volume in 2010 this increase was offset by a decrease in volume attributable to a decline in average volatility for equity products as measured by the cboe volatility index in 2010 when compared with 2009 

we believe that equity product volume decreased in 2009 when compared with 2008 due to the decline in volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index average volatility decreased starting in the beginning of 2009 through the end of 2009 in addition the decline in volume was attributable to the termination of our license to list russellbased contracts 

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key foreign exchange futures and options products 

 

 we believe that the increase in volume in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to the weakening of the euro and british pound compared with the us dollar uncertainty surrounding the euro following the european credit crisis contributed to increased volatility which led to increased trading volume for the euro products in 2010 when compared with 2009 we also believe that the strengthening of the yen compared with the us dollar contributed to an increase in volume in addition our crossselling efforts to market participants in other asset classes as well as increased global sales presence contributed to growth in volume 

  

in 2009 when compared with 2008 we believe that the convergence of interest rates towards zero between the european united states and japanese markets led to flat volume for our euro products and a decline in volume for our japanese yen products the increase in volume for the british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar products was attributable to a divergence between interest rates in the united states and interest rates in the british australian and canadian markets 

agricultural commodity products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity futures and options products 

 

 we believe that the increase in average daily volume for our commodity products in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to increased volatility associated with changes in global supply attributable to global weather events in addition increased demand for protein in emerging markets has increased demand for feedgrains 

in 2009 when compared with 2008 we believe a decrease in commodity price volatility and decreased demand for commodities products as a result of the credit crisis within the united states caused the overall decline in volume for commodities products we believe the credit crisis reduced certain customers’ ability or need to assume and maintain positions 

energy products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy futures and options products 

 

  

nm not meaningful 

in 2010 when compared with 2009 we believe that the growth in volume was attributable to an improved economic outlook as well as increased liquidity within the energy futures market we believe crude oil contract volume increased at a higher rate than natural gas contract volume due to an increase in volume generated from customers outside the united states as well as increased volatility in the crude oil market 

we believe the increase in average daily volume in 2009 when compared with 2008 was due to market participants seeking to mitigate counterparty risk on their overthecounter exposures through central counter party clearing the table above includes volume for the period prior to our merger with nymex in 2008 

metal products 

we believe that the increase in metal product volume in 2010 was attributable to increased investment in precious metals as an asset class during periods of uncertainty in interest rates and foreign exchange in 2010 when compared with 2009 gold contract volume increased by 31 to an average of 02 million contracts per day 

  

in 2009 when compared with 2008 we believe metal products volume decreased including the period prior to our merger due to lower price volatility and decreased demand for metal products as a result of the credit crisis within the united states in 2009 when compared with 2008 average daily volume for gold contract volume decreased by 6 to 02 million contracts per day 

average rate per contract 

the average rate per contract decreased in 2010 when compared with the same period in 2009 due to an increase in member trading volume which increased faster than nonmember trading in 2010 in general members receive lower rates compared with nonmembers in addition the average rate per contract decreased due to a lower portion of equity and energy products as a percentage of total volume compared with interest rate products as a percentage of volume equity products volume decreased by 4 and energy product volume decreased by 1 while interest rate product volume increased by 3 equity and energy products have higher fees compared with interest rate products 

in 2009 when compared with 2008 the average rate per contract increased due to the inclusion of a full year of volume from nymex products and cme clearport services which had an average rate per contract of 1512 and 2051 respectively in 2009 additionally the average rate per contract increased due to a lower portion of interest rate products as a percentage of total volume compared with equity products which have a higher rate per contract as a percentage of cme and cbot volume equity products volume increased by 2 in 2009 while interest rate products volume decreased by 4 when compared with 2008 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers one firm represented 13 and one firm represented 12 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2010 one firm represented 13 and one firm represented 11 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2009 one firm represented 12 and one firm represented 10 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2008 should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from the loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm 

other sources of revenue 

the increase in market data and information services revenue was principally due to market data and licensing revenue from index services which began march 19 2010 an increase in the basic device monthly fee in 2010 also contributed to an increase in revenues in 2010 

revenue generated from nymex increased by 592 million in 2009 when compared with 2008 in addition revenues increased in 2009 when compared with 2008 due to additional revenue generated from cma as well as an increase in data feed surcharges and vendor licensing fees 

yearoveryear increases in screen counts generated by business combinations were partially offset by an overall decrease in screen counts for existing customers decreases in screen counts were due to costcutting initiatives at customer firms the table below includes screen counts for cme cbot and nymex 

 

   

the two largest resellers of our market data represented approximately 45 55 and 56 of our market data and information services revenue in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendor’s customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us 

other revenues increased in 2010 when compared with 2009 due to 107 million of revenue generated from our agreement with bmfbovespa to develop a new multiasset class electronic trading platform and incremental processing services revenue generated from various strategic relationships this was partially offset by a 63 million decline in trading revenues generated by gfx corporation gfx resulting from lower trading activity and narrower trading margins 

other revenues decreased in 2009 compared with 2008 due to a decline in processing services revenue of 536 million in 2008 we recognized processing services revenues from our trade matching agreement with nymex which was terminated in august 2008 upon our merger with nymex the decrease in revenues was partially offset by rental income and other buildingrelated revenue generated from our building in new york city which was acquired as part of our merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 

expenses 

 

 2010 compared with 2009 

operating expenses increased by 1489 million in 2010 when compared with 2009 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase in operating expenses 

 

   

  

the rise in salaries benefits and employer taxes was attributable to an increase in average headcount due to index services as well as salary increases and rising healthcare costs 

our improved performance relative to our 2010 cash earnings target compared with 2009 relative to our 2009 cash earnings target led to the increase in our bonus expense 

impairment charges on goodwill and trade name related to our cma operations in the second quarter of 2010 led to an increase in expenses in 2010 

global expansion and establishment of strategic partnerships contributed to an increase in marketing and travel expenses in 2010

2009 compared with 2008 

in 2009 operating expenses increased by 449 million when compared with 2008 the following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase decrease in operating expenses 

 

 amortization of purchased intangibles increased in 2009 due to our merger with nymex holdings which was completed in august 2008 

an increase in average headcount as a result of our merger with nymex holdings in 2008 contributed to the rise in salaries benefits and employer taxes subsequent to our merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 

licensing and other fee agreements increased in 2009 due to an increase in broker rebates on nymex products 

legal fees incurred to support various strategic initiatives including our efforts to provide clearing services for credit default swaps and other overthecounter products led to growth in expenses in 2009 when compared with 2008 

marketing and travel expenses decreased in 2009 due to the company’s expense reduction efforts in 2009 

impairment charges recognized in 2008 on goodwill related to our swapstream operations led to a decrease in this expense in 2009

nonoperating income expense 

 

  

nm not meaningful 

investment income the increase in investment income in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to a 160 million increase in dividend income from our investments in bmfbovespa tmx group inc and bolsa mexicana de valores sab de cv and a 37 million gain resulting from the sale of various equity and debt securities the increase was partially offset by a 48 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates 

in 2009 investment income declined when compared with 2008 due to decreases in market interest rates resulting from rate reductions by the federal open market committee throughout 2008 the decline due to interest rates was partially offset by an increase in the invested portion of clearing firms’ cash from performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions in addition we recognized 45 million in gains on our marketable securities related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan in 2009 compared with losses of 82 million in 2008 gains and losses from these securities are offset by an equal amount of compensation and benefits expense 

impairment of longterm investments in 2010 we determined that our investment in onechicago was impaired based on its historical financial performance and other factors as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 22 million at december 31 2009 we determined our investment in dme was impaired due to the excess of our carrying value over our investment’s estimated fair value as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 236 million in 2009 we also determined that our investment in imarex asa imarex was impaired due to an extended and significant decline in the market price of its stock as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 224 million in 2009 in 2008 we determined that our investment in bmfbovespa sa bmfbovespa was impaired due to an extended and significant decline in the market price of its stock as a result we recognized an impairment loss of 2745 million 

gains losses on derivative investments in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recognized an 86 million loss due to ineffectiveness on the interest rate swap contract used to hedge interest rate risk on our term loan both the swap contract and the term loan were originally scheduled to expire in august 2011 in december 2010 we approved a plan to refinance the term loan in january 2011 resulting in ineffectiveness of the hedge 

in march 2010 we recognized a 60 million gain on derivative investments as a result of a settlement from the lehman brothers holdings inc lehman bankruptcy proceedings the settlement related to an unsecured claim against lehman as counterparty to an overthecounter put option contract we purchased to hedge our risk of changes in the fair value of bmfbovespa stock resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the brazilian real the net gain loss on derivative investments recognized in 2008 was due to the loss on the put option contract resulting from weakening of the us dollar compared with the brazilian real until its termination in 2008 

  

securities lending income expense during 2009 and 2010 cme’s securities lending program remained suspended as high volatility in the credit markets and extreme demand for us treasury securities continued suspension of the program resulted in a decrease in net securities lending interest from 2008 to 2010 we expect the securities lending program to remain suspended throughout 2011 

interest and other borrowing costs in 2010 when compared with 2009 interest expense increased due to the issuance of 6125 million of 440 fixed rate notes due 2018 this resulted in an increase in average effective yield and total cost of borrowing however average debt balances have decreased in 2010 due to the reduction in overall debt levels throughout the year the increase in expense was also attributable to a full year of interest expense recognized on the 575 fixed rate notes issued in february 2009 

the increases in interest and other borrowing costs in 2009 when compared with 2008 were due to higher average debt levels outstanding which were the result of debt issued in august 2008 in conjunction with the nymex holdings merger these borrowings consisted of commercial paper and short and longterm notes in february 2009 we terminated our revolving bridge facility the increase in interest and other borrowing costs in 2009 was also attributable to the 76 million of debt issuance costs recognized for the bridge facility during 2009 including 46 million of accelerated costs resulting from the facility’s termination 

effective january 11 2011 we terminated our 14 billion senior credit facility including the 4205 million term loan and entered into a new 10 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility which matures in january 2014 we expect interest expense to decrease by 26 million in 2011 due to the refinancing of the senior credit facility 

 

 total cost of borrowing includes interest commitment fees discount accretion and debt issuance costs 

guarantee of exercise rights privileges in december 2009 final approval of the settlement of the erps associated with our cbot holdings merger occurred and we reduced our liability associated with our guarantee of the erps to zero which resulted in a gain in 2009 following the resolution of the lawsuit we also adjusted the value of the 159 erps that we held to the expected settlement value which also contributed to the gain in 2009 we recognized a gain in 2008 due to a reassessment of possible outcomes of the litigation 

equity in net losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries the termination of our investment in fxms our joint venture with thomas reuters group plc reuters in the fourth quarter of 2008 contributed to the decrease in losses in 2009 when compared with 2008 in 2008 we recognized losses from our investment in fxms of 265 million including a 159 million write off of our recorded investment in fxms and our portion of the remaining capital needed to wind down operations 

income tax provision 

the following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented 

 

   

the increase in the effective tax rate in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to a 512 million charge to record the impact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing deferred tax liabilities the state and local tax rate increased due to revised state apportionment estimates resulting from annual state tax filings the increase in the effective tax rate was also due to the impairment of cma’s goodwill and trade name in the second quarter of 2010 which was not deductible 

in 2009 the rate increased as a result of an additional valuation allowance of 644 million related to unrealized capital losses the increase was offset by a decrease resulting from a 389 million reduction in net deferred tax liabilities related to a new york city tax law change enacted in 2009 in 2008 the rate reflected a 483 million charge to record the impact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing net deferred tax liabilities partially offset by a first quarter 2008 illinois tax law change that resulted in a 386 million reduction in net deferred tax liabilities 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements until we began our commercial paper program in mid2007 we historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations while our cost structure is fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are dependent on trading volume levels we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments however it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper future public debt offerings or by borrowing money from financial institutions 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancelable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 these were as follows 

 

  

 operating leases include rent payments for office space in chicago and other smaller offices in the united states and in various foreign countries the operating lease for our headquarters in chicago expires in november 2022 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 85 million to 136 million we also maintain an operating lease for additional office space in chicago which expires in november 2023 annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from 39 million to 62 million 

purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to purchase software licenses hardware and maintenance as well as telecommunication services other longterm liabilities include primarily funding obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through investment in increased system capacity and performance and through technological initiatives on our electronic 

  

trading platform each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data centers telecommunications capabilities and other operating equipment in 2011 we expect capital expenditures to total approximately 180 million we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders the decision to pay a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant as well as our debt instruments as discussed below cme group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its or their ability to declare and pay dividends in 2010 our quarterly dividend remained at 115 per share on january 5 2011 our board approved a change in our annual dividend policy to increase the target from approximately 30 of the prior year’s cash earnings to approximately 35 of the prior year’s cash earnings on february 23 2011 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 140 per share payable on march 25 to shareholders of record on march 10 assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately 936 million 

sources and uses of cash the following is a summary of cash provided by used by operating investing and financing activities 

 

 operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 when compared with 2009 was due to higher trading volumes and increased profitability in 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was 4043 million higher than net income this increase was primarily the result of depreciation and amortization expense of 1299 million and amortization of purchased intangibles of 1281 million an increase in accrued expenses also contributed to the overall increase 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2009 when compared with 2008 due to decreased profitability excluding impairment charges in 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was 2573 million higher than net income this increase was due primarily to 1263 million of depreciation and amortization and 1251 million of amortization of purchased intangibles 

investing activities 

the termination of the nymex securities lending program in 2009 as well as the decrease in proceeds from marketable securities net of purchases of 2782 million contributed to the increase in cash used for investing in 2010 when compared with 2009 

the increase in cash in 2009 when compared with 2008 was due primarily to cash paid to shareholders in our merger with nymex holdings in 2008 of 28 billion net of cash received and a payment of 6120 million for the termination of certain nymex membership rights in conjunction with the merger the increase in cash was also due to a 3158 million net decrease in nymex securities lending program investments and a 3824 million increase in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities net of purchases in 2009 

  

financing activities 

the decrease in cash used in 2010 relative to 2009 was attributable to a decrease in commercial paper repayments net of proceeds proceeds from our share issuance to bmfbovespa as well as the termination of the nymex securities lending program in 2009 the decrease was partially offset by the distribution to dow jones of 6075 million related to index services as well as an increase in share repurchases of 5483 million share repurchases increased in an effort to offset most of the dilution associated with the issuance of shares to bmfbovespa 

the increase in cash used in 2009 relative to 2008 was due to new issuances of debt of 29 billion in 2008 in conjunction with our merger with nymex holdings compared with net debt reductions of 9001 million in 2009 

debt instruments the following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of december 31 2010

we maintain a 364day fully secured committed line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian for our collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of us treasury securities government agency securities or 

  

money market mutual fund as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility the line of credit provides for borrowings of up to 10 billion at december 31 2010 guaranty fund collateral available was 22 billion we have the option to request an increase in the line from 10 billion to 20 billion in addition to the 364day fully secured committed line of credit we also have the option to use the new 10 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default 

in addition our 364day fully secured committed revolving line of credit contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as cme consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 1250 million in the event that cme elects to increase the facility the minimum consolidated tangible net worth test would increase ratably up to 1875 million 

the indentures governing our floating and fixed rate notes our 364day fully secured committed revolving line of credit for 10 billion and our 10 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

at december 31 2010 we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 9455 million 

as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities

the following table summarizes our credit ratings as of december 31 2010 

 

 given our ability to pay down debt levels and refinance existing debt facilities if necessary we expect to maintain an investment grade rating if our ratings are downgraded due to a change in control which results in a downgrade below investment grade we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed and floating rate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest

liquidity and cash management cash and cash equivalents totaled 8552 million at december 31 2010 and 2606 million at december 31 2009 the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of 

  

anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices a majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in us treasury securities or us government agency securities our exposure to risk is minimal given the nature of the investments 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that a 141 million contribution in 2011 will allow us to meet our funding goal however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2011 and the december 31 2011 discount rate 

net current deferred tax assets of 183 million and 238 million are included in other current assets at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively total net current deferred tax assets include unrealized losses stockbased compensation and accrued expenses

net longterm deferred tax assets also include a 193 million deferred tax asset for foreign net operating losses related to swapstream our assessment at december 31 2010 was that we did not currently meet the morelikelythannot threshold that would allow us to realize the value of acquired and accumulated foreign net operating losses in the future as a result the 193 million deferred tax assets arising from these net operating losses have been fully reserved

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2010 consisted of fixed rate borrowings of 21 billion and variable rate borrowings of 4205 million borrowings subject to interest rate fluctuations as of december 31 2010 included the 4205 million term loan due august 2011 the term loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to threemonth libor plus 100 per year in september 2008 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that modifies the variable interest obligation associated with this facility so that the interest payable effectively became fixed at a rate of 472 beginning with the interest accrued after october 22 2008 on january 11 2011 we terminated our senior credit facility which included repayment of the 4205 million term loan in conjunction with the termination of our senior credit facility we also terminated the interest rate swap agreement 

credit risk 

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchange as well as through thirdparty exchanges and overthecounter markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including our clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for our exchangetraded and overthecounter products including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps for futures and options on futures we typically establish performance bond levels to cover at least 95 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period providing further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk for cleared overthecounter credit default and interest rate swaps we typically establish performance bond levels to cover at least 99 of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period providing further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk we marktomarket all open positions at least twice a day and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to 

  

clearing firms whose positions have gained value for product offerings within newer markets positions are markedtomarket daily with the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant this allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions this transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity we maintain a financial safeguard package for our clearing firms for futures options and cleared overthecounter credit default swap contracts in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm for futures options and cleared overthecounter credit default swap contracts we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation these assets include the defaulting firm’s guaranty fund contributions performance bonds and any other available assets such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our surplus funds guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit surplus funds represent the amount of cme working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support normal operations and further reduced by 1000 million that is designated by cme for our interest rate swap financial safeguard package 

we also maintain an independent interest rate swaps financial safeguard package in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm for cleared overthecounter interest rate swap contracts we would first apply the defaulting firm’s guaranty fund contributions and performance bonds to satisfy its payment obligation thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use the 1000 million of cme working capital that would be required to be contributed by cme in the event of a default in interest rate swaps then the interest rate swap guaranty fund contributions of other interest rate swap clearing firms to satisfy the deficit in addition funds can be collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms clearing interest rate swap contracts 

we maintain a 10 billion 364day fully secured committed line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house we have the option to request an increase in the line from 10 billion to 20 billion we may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary custodian of the collateral or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as guaranty fund contributions in our ief program to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line in addition to the 364day fully secured committed line of credit we also have the option to use the new 10 billion multicurrency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default 

aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for futures options and cleared overthecounter credit default swap contracts as well as cleared overthecounter interest rate swap contracts was 865847 million including 37170 million of cash performance bond deposits a defaulting firm’s performance bond collateral can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm 

  

the following shows the available assets of our clearing house at december 31 2010 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for futures options and cleared overthecounter credit default swap contract after first utilizing the defaulting firm’s available assets

   despite these safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk resulting from our operations is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results 

foreign currency translation risk 

we have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities from their respective functional currencies to the us dollar at each reporting date fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of total assets and liabilities we report in our consolidated balance sheets the financial statements of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the british pound and the brazilian real and are translated into us dollars using a current exchange rate gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders’ equity the translation adjustment net of tax for 2010 2009 and 2008 was 05 million 26 million and 957 million respectively 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 10 and 13 of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balances were held by foreign subsidiaries whose balance sheets were translated from a foreign functional currency to us dollars at each reporting date 

other foreign currency risk 

we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to the equity investments noted under equity price risk any foreign exchange rate risk related to these investments is reflected in the equity price risk section below 

equity price risk 

we hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded at their fair value equity securities whose sale is restricted for greater than 12 months are carried at original cost net of impairment charges until the restriction is within 12 months of expiration at which time they are recorded at fair value 

fair values for publiclytraded equity investments are based on quoted market prices fair values are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 

the table below summarizes our equity investments subject to equity price fluctuation at december 31 2010 equity investments are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 

 

  

   

beginning in february 2011 the stock will be accounted for as an availableforsale security and any unrealized gain will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income prior to february 2011 an unrealized loss of 817 million net of tax resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss upon recognizing impairment on the investment in december 2008 the 817 million unrealized loss is not reflected in the table above 

we do not currently hedge against equity price risk equity investments are assessed for otherthantemporary impairment on a quarterly basis an assessment of whether an equity investment is otherthantemporarily impaired takes into consideration the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss at december 31 2010 we determined that none of the equity investments listed above were otherthantemporarily impaired

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion cme group inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the coso criteria

 item 1 business tableend overview 

building on the heritage of its futures exchanges cme cbot nymex and comex cme group serves the risk management and investment needs of customers around the globe cme group formerly known as chicago mercantile exchange holdings inc became publicly traded in december 2002 we completed our acquisition of cbot in july 2007 and nymex in august 2008 

our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments we break our member customers into four segments based on trading activity proprietary trading firms primarily algorithmic banks and investment banks top hedge funds and “other” which includes smaller member firms and individual traders we also have a fifth segment of customers which is comprised of our nonmember customers who pay higher fees than the member category as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 140 clearing firms one firm represented 11 and one firm represented 10 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2009 should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from the loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm our trading volume can be seasonal and historically we have experienced higher sequential volume during the first and second quarters followed by decreases in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year 

during 2009 our industry and the financial services area in particular faced many challenges however we sought opportunities amongst the challenges and we were steadfast in pursuing and executing on these opportunities as described in this report 

highly liquid markets 

cme group is the only exchange to offer access to all major asset classes for futures products from a single electronic trading platform and on trading floors in chicago and new york city specifically we offer futures and options on futures based on interest rates equity indexes foreign exchange energy agricultural commodities metal and alternative investment products such as weather and real estate we provide the facilities to conduct open outcry and electronic trading and we match clear and guarantee trades executed on our exchanges and certain bilateral trades that we clear our markets provide an effective and transparent forum for our customers to manage their risk and meet their investment needs relating to our markets we believe that our customers choose to trade on our centralized markets due to their liquidity and transparency and our central counterparty clearing guarantee more than 80 of our trading volume comes from trades made electronically on our cme globex electronic trading platform our aggregate volume in 2009 was approximately 26 billion contracts as of december 31 2009 our open interest stood at 780 million contracts open interest is the number of outstanding contracts at the close of the trading day open interest can also be defined as the total number of futures contracts or options on futures contracts that have not yet been exercised expired or fulfilled by delivery open interest serves as an indicator of market liquidity market liquidity or the ability of a market to absorb the execution of large purchases or sales quickly and efficiently is key to attracting customers and contributing to a market’s success in spite of the difficult economic climate we experienced an improvement in our open interest during 2009 which grew by 24 from the beginning of the year 

most diverse product line 

we serve the riskmanagement needs of customers around the globe offering the widest range of benchmark products available on any exchange and covering all major asset classes our products provide a means for hedging speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with among other things interest rate sensitive instruments equity ownership changes in the value of foreign currency and changes in the 

  

prices of commodities these include products based on the entire us interest rate yield curve equity indexes foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy metals and alternative investment products 

futures and options provide a way to protect against—and potentially profit from—price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities futures contracts are legally binding agreements to buy or sell something in the future such as livestock or foreign currency the buyer and seller of a futures contract agree on a price today for a product to be delivered and paid for in the future each contract specifies the quantity of the item and the time of delivery or payment an option on a futures contract is a right but not an obligation to buy or sell a futures contract at a specified price on or before a certain expiration date 

superior trading technology 

we strive to provide the most flexible architecture in terms of bringing new technology innovations and solutions to the market our cme globex electronic trading platform is accessible virtually 24 hours a day throughout the trading week our platform offers 

 

  

  

  

  

 customers benefit from direct connectivity ongoing development efforts a single source for customer support and highly efficient access to realtime market data the platform is continuously enhanced to serve our customers’ needs for highspeed highvolume capacity improved options trading capabilities and a range of new products in 2009 we were named the number one technology innovator by informationweek  it was also the sixth consecutive year we were named to this prestigious list of technology innovators cme globex handled an average daily volume of 83 million contracts in 2009 our alltime record of 205 million contracts was on january 22 2008 representing volume of 132 million cme products 61 million cbot products and 12 million nymex products to ensure that we can meet the heavy demands placed on our systems we have rigorous requirements for the performance scalability reliability ease of use and costs of our infrastructure 

global reach 

we offer a number of programs and products designed specifically to appeal to a global audience customers from all over the world trade our products primarily electronically as described below under “growth strategy—globalizing the business” we continue to expand our business globally by educating nonus customers on the benefits of our product suite and by entering into strategic alliances such as our relationships with bmfbovespa sa and the korea exchange inc and our most recently completed partnership with bursa malaysia derivatives berhad 

financial safeguards 

we own our own clearing house—cme clearing our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and soundness of our markets cme clearing protects the financial integrity of our markets by serving as the counterparty to every trade—becoming the buyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer—and limiting credit risk it is responsible for settling trading accounts clearing trades collecting and maintaining performance bond funds regulating delivery and reporting trading data cme clearing limits the accumulation of debt from trading losses with twice daily marktomarket settlement 

  

in 2009 our industry was subjected to increased concerns about counterparty credit risk stemming from the financial crisis that began in 2008 during such times our financial safeguards continued to provide our customers with transparency and liquidity in all asset classes importantly none of our customers incurred a financial loss due to a counterparty failure following our merger with nymex we extended the benefits of our clearing model to the overthecounter market through cme clearport which is a comprehensive set of flexible solutions for mitigating counterparty risk in overthecounter trading in december 2009 we also began providing clearing services for credit default swaps basically a credit default swap contract provides the buyer with protection against specific credit risks we believe that providing clearing services to the credit default swap market will provide greater transparency security and stability to that marketplace 

as of december 31 2009 we maintained approximately 837 billion in cash investments and letters of credit related to performance bonds security deposits and other collateral of which 114 billion was in excess of the clearing house requirements we set for our customers performance bonds are deposits required from our clearing firms to ensure that they can cover potential losses in connection with their trading positions we require these deposits as part of our financial safeguards to help ensure that clearing firms can meet their obligations to their customers and to cme clearing 

ownership of our clearing house also enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development technology market regulation and other risk management activities 

history

growth strategy 

increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services create significant opportunities for growth we believe that we can capitalize on these trends and build on our competitive strengths by implementing the following strategies 

 

  

  

 growing the core business we intend to advance our position as a leader in the futures industry by growing our core business as part of this initiative we plan to continue to generate organic growth through the launch of new products expanding on the strength of our existing benchmark products and by enhancing our customer relations to allow us to crosssell our products 

  

we plan to continue to work with existing and potential customers to develop new futures and options products that provide an array of relevant risk management tools we are also enhancing our marketing capabilities with a focus on customer education advertising and public relations to crosssell our existing products to our current customer base we continue to communicate our unique benefits—a secure effective and costefficient place for customers to come and manage their risk through our diverse products liquidity anonymity and central counterparty clearing we continue to look for ways to build upon our success as we continue to grow our business in areas such as emerging markets and the overthecounter market 

on february 10 2010 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with dow jones in which we would take a 90 ownership interest and dow jones would own the remaining 10 in a new joint venture that will own the dow jones indexes which include the dow jones industrial average and approximately 130000 index properties pending regulatory approval and completion of customary closing conditions the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2010 this venture creates a new opportunity for us to grow our index business and to further diversify our revenue streams by building on our existing brands and expanding the global reach of dow jones’ index creation and calculation services businesses across complementary asset classes including cash derivatives and customized overthecounter markets 

globalizing the business our goal is to expand and diversify our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world the most broadly diversified portfolio of benchmark products in 2009 we continued our initiative to enhance our global marketing efforts in order to broaden the understanding of the benefits of our products targeting in particular asia and europe and implementing global sales and marketing plans to reach new customers and crosssell our products to existing customers as well as extending our international incentive programs to apply to our energy and metal customers during 2009 we extended our global reach with several key partnerships we launched the first phase of our program with the korea exchange to provide customers with afterhours access to the kospi 200 futures hosted on our cme globex platform by providing order routing services we are awaiting approval from the korean regulators to expand access beyond our seoul telecommunications hub to allow us to reach a broader group of market participants during the year we acquired an equity stake in bursa malaysia derivatives berhad and entered into an agreement to provide globex order routing and matching services for its derivatives segment which will also provide us with a license to use its crude palm oil settlement prices for future product development on february 11 2010 we announced a nonbinding letter of intent with bmfbovespa to expand our existing strategic partnership to develop a new multiasset class electronic trading platform that will be deployed by bmfbovespa for use in its own cash equities and derivatives markets and both of us will have the ability to license the platform to other exchanges internationally these partnerships are expected to expand our transaction processing opportunities and increase our global presence 

we will continue to explore opportunities to position cme group to benefit from growth in key geographies by targeting global customers making strategic investments and leveraging our diverse product offerings 

serving the overthecounter markets we continue to expand our business serving the overthecounter markets by developing overthecounter products and services along with new capabilities and functionalities and entering these markets through acquisitions strategic partnerships and commercial arrangements as a result of our merger with nymex holdings in 2008 we now own clearport launched in 2002 to provide centralized clearing services and mitigate risk in the energy marketplace cme clearport now clears transactions across a broad array of products around the world with tailored offerings for the needs of each market with the benefit of central counterparty clearing during 2009 we launched more than 330 products on cme clearport and cleared an average of more than 494000 contracts daily 

in 2009 we restructured our joint effort with citadel investment group related to credit default swaps to target clearingonly services beginning in december 2009 we began providing our clearing solution for the credit default swap market which delivers 

 

   

  

  

  

 our cleared credit default swap products comprise the highest volume markit cdx and markit itraxx indices they are designed to mirror bilateral overthecounter contracts we also support trade submission through cme clearport enabling connectivity from any affirmationconfirmation or trading platform 

products 

we believe that the range and diversity of our products contribute significantly to our success we offer markets in futures and options on futures contracts based on the us interest rate yield curve equity indexes foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy metals and alternative investment products our products are traded through the cme globex electronic trading platform our open outcry auction markets in chicago and new york city or through privately negotiated transactions that we clear for the year ended december 31 2009 we derived 22 billion or 83 of our total revenues from fees associated with trading and clearing our products these fees include per contract charges for trade execution as well as clearing and cme globex fees fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded the method of trade and the trading privileges of the customer making the trade generally members are charged lower fees than nonmembers certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our efforts to encourage increased liquidity in our markets our markets also generate valuable data and information regarding pricing and trading activity in our products which provides us with the opportunity to sell our market data we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” page 55 for the average daily volume of contracts traded in our principal product lines for the last three years 

interest rate products our interest rate products enable banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks and in turn help to reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing our interest rate products allow our customers to execute transactions across the entire us dollardenominated yield curve using some of the world’s most actively traded futures and options products customers may manage short medium and longterm interest rate risk using our products based on eurodollars us treasuries swaps and other dollarrelated instruments in 2009 we extended our relationship with the british banker’s association with a longterm agreement for our use of its london interbank offered rate to settle various interest rate products including our benchmark eurodollar contract as a result of our acquisition of cbot our interest rate products include cbot’s thirtyyear us treasury bond futures and options on futures tenyear fiveyear and twoyear us treasury note futures and options interest rate swap futures and options and federal funds futures and options in 2009 we launched threeyear treasury note futures in january 2010 we launched our ultra tbond futures contract to date this is the most successful new interest rate product launch in our history in terms of volume and open interest growth since launch 

fortytwo percent of our overall annual trading volume in 2009 and 26 of our clearing and transaction fees was based upon our interest rate products in 2009 we experienced an overall decline in interest rate volume due largely to the credit crisis and the federal reserve bank’s zero interest rate policy for shortterm interest rates several macroeconomic factors that drive interest rates have begun to stabilize over the course of the year including improvements in liquidity and credit spreads but areas of weakness remain in 2010 we plan to continue our efforts to expand our customer base and increase international participation through additional marketing efforts and educational programs we will also look to expand our benchmark products 

  

equity products our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure for hedging or speculative purposes to changes in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities by allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks our equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets 

we are a leading equity index marketplace offering futures and options products including our emini contracts on key benchmark equity indexes covering small medium and largecap companies in the us europe and asia these include the standard  poor’s dow jones nasdaq nikkei msci and ftsexinhua indexes and others we have exclusive licensing arrangements with standard  poor’s corporation sp nasdaq omx group inc nasdaq omx and dow jones  company inc dow jones which allow us to offer futures and options on futures on their indexes including our contracts based on the sp 500 index the nasdaq100 index and the dow jones industrial average as previously discussed we have also entered into a definitive agreement with dow jones to create a joint venture which will create new opportunities for growing our index business for a detailed description of these licensing arrangements see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—licensing agreements” 

trading in our equity products represented 28 of our total trading volume and 24 of our clearing and transaction fees during 2009 

we believe our leading market position in equity products is a result of the liquidity of our markets the status of the sp 500 the nasdaq100 and the dow jones industrial average indexes as the principal us financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns and the appeal to investors and traders of our emini products and other equity products and our cme globex platform these investors include public and private pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets 

we believe future growth in our equity products will come from continued counterparty credit concerns continued education of our customers as to the benefits of our equity product portfolio and our trading platform to serve their risk management needs and the benefits of futures products over cash equities we believe that our equity volumes may continue to be impacted by and are in large part influenced by the trading volume levels of the underlying markets as well as the level of market volatility 

foreign exchange products we became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in 1972 our foreign exchange market serves as an effective and efficient means of risk transfer for the global foreign exchange market bringing together a broad array of client segments by offering investment as well as risk management opportunities our customers benefit from dealing anonymously in a fully transparent market where large and small customers have equal access to the same prices and deep pool of liquidity our foreign exchange products provide the tools and resources to hedge foreign exchange risk facilitating crossborder trade and commerce while mitigating the risks to profitability due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market our foreign exchange market attracts both buy and sellside investors including commercial and investment banks hedge funds commodity trading advisors proprietary trading firms and individual investors in 2009 we launched a series of innovative smallersized foreign exchange contracts called forex emicros designed to enable retail traders and investors to costeffectively access the security transparency and liquidity of our products we also added turkish lira futures to our foreign exchange product suite approximately 97 of our foreign exchange products are traded electronically on the cme globex platform ensuring that business is transacted quickly with maximum operational efficiency 

today we offer approximately 40 foreign exchange futures and approximately 30 foreign exchange options on futures products covering major as well as a broad array of emerging market currency pairs in more than 20 different currencies 

in 2009 we saw an average daily volume of 624000 foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of 798 billion a day trading in our foreign exchange products represented 6 of our total trading volume in 2009 and 6 

  

of our clearing and transaction fees in 2009 while the broader overthecounter fx market volume declined by roughly 25 based on central bank turnover statistics cme group’s average daily volume for foreign exchange products was flat when compared with 2008 we believe this result is largely due to the breadth of our product coverage and diversity of our customer base as the global fx market was marked by extreme market volatility changes in global interest rates and increased risk aversion by market participants resulting from the credit crisis 

we believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and diversifying our product suite and customer base we continue to expand our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array of customer segments as we continue to expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market we expect increased trading volume from customers outside of the united states we also expect an increased demand in the overthecounter market for cleared products which we have been targeting to serve 

commodity products our commodity products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management these products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities including agricultural producers of commodities and food processors commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business we have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products including futures contracts based on cattle hogs pork bellies lumber dairy products soybeans corn wheat oats and rough rice we also added 11 agricultural swaps on cme clearport commodity products accounted for 7 of our trading volume and 10 of clearing and transaction fees during 2009 

energy products following our acquisition of nymex and comex we now offer the most extensive and liquid energy complex in the world including light sweet crude oil wti natural gas henry hub and electricity products many of our energy contracts are benchmarks that set the price for these resources worldwide in 2009 we launched over 300 new energy products on cme clearport in response to customer demand stemming from counterparty credit risk concerns energy products accounted for 15 of our trading volume and 29 of clearing and transaction fees during 2009 

metal products our metals futures markets include fullsize contracts on gold silver platinum palladium copper and steel as well as emini contracts for gold silver and copper we also extended our cme clearport clearing services to london gold futures metal products accounted for 2 of our trading volume and 5 of clearing and transaction fees during 2009 

market data and information products our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products that we believe enhances the appeal of our products the dissemination of realtime data generates revenues and supports our customer base with timely market information we sell our market data which includes information about bids offers trades and trade size in our products to banks brokerdealers pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions we distribute our market data over the cme market data platform directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets and to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges other thirdparty data providers and news services and then resell their consolidated data revenues from market data products totaled 3311 million or 13 of our total revenues in 2009 

sophisticated quantitative approaches to risk management as well as customer time sensitivity have created new needs uses and demands for tradingrelated data and analytics this timely information has become even more important in light of the volatility and uncertainty in today’s markets we continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by creating new valueadded services to complement our market data products including databases analytical tools and other services to assist endusers our market data was significantly enhanced in 2009 with the expansion of futures market depth to include additional order information our realtime webbased market data application cme equotes experienced growth in subscribers in 2009 as we added nymex and comex data and as subscribers looked for a more costeffective solution cme datamine our historical market data service continued to have strong demand from the hedge fund and algorithmic trading community to power their trading models 

  

as part of our market data and information products business we also supply services to sp and the dubai mercantile exchange in connection with the usage reporting contract administration and associated billing and revenue collection for the display and integration of their market data into our standard market data distribution we are the exclusive distributor of dow jones index data from our market data distribution platform we also provide access to all prices for products listed on the minneapolis grain exchange and the kansas city board of trade which are available for electronic trading on cme globex in 2009 we began offering realtime market data on our cme market data platform for bmfbovespa as well we believe that there will be further opportunities to continue leveraging our market data distribution capabilities with new or existing strategic partners 

we believe that there has been a decline in subscriptions of market data due primarily to the consolidation of many of our customers and related headcount reductions as a result of the recent financial crisis based upon historical trends we believe that realtime market data subscribers will increase again as unemployment numbers begin to improve in the financial services industry 

execution 

our primary trade execution facilities consist of our cme globex electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors in chicago and new york city these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency and are supported by substantial infrastructure and technology for order routing trade reporting market data dissemination and market surveillance and regulation in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house 

electronic trading our cme globex electronic trading platform maintains an electronic centralized order book and trade execution algorithm for futures contracts and options on futures contracts and allows users to enter orders directly into the order book in 2009 81 of our average daily trading volume was executed electronically compared with 80 in 2008 during 2009 approximately 72 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from electronic trading 

open outcry trading we also offer our members the ability to execute transactions in an openauction format on our trading floors—a centralized meeting place for traders and floor brokers to trade our products orders by market participants not physically located on the trading floor are communicated to floor brokers current market information and news are displayed on wallboards hung above the trading pits in the second quarter of 2008 we integrated the cme and cbot trading floors at one location at 141 west jackson boulevard in chicago as a result of our acquisition of nymex we now operate open outcry trading in new york city at one north end avenue we completed the integration of the nymex and comex trading floors into one floor in the second quarter of 2009 during 2009 approximately 11 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from open outcry trading 

privately negotiated and overthecounter transactions in addition to offering traditional open outcry and electronic trading through the cme globex platform we permit qualified customers to trade our products by entering into privately negotiated transactions which are reported and included in the market data we distribute we also clear settle and guarantee these transactions through our clearing house and cme clearport these transactions provide our customers with the flexibility to negotiate their own prices trade a wide array of financial and commodity products and still take advantage of our financial safeguards during 2009 approximately 17 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from this type of trading 

clearing 

we own and operate our clearing house—cme clearing—that clears settles and guarantees every futures and options contract traded through our exchange in addition to overthecounter products cleared through cme clearport and credit default swap contracts our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and 

  

soundness of our markets ownership and control of our own clearing house also enables us to retain the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products by owning our clearing house we control the cost structure and the technology development cycle for our clearing services it helps us manage our new product initiatives without being dependent on an outside entity it also benefits our customers by creating operational risk management and product benefits additionally owning our own clearing house allows us to generate additional revenue by providing clearing services to other exchanges 

in 2009 our clearing house cleared an average of 103 million contracts daily and 26 billion contracts overall as of december 31 2009 we maintained approximately 837 billion in cash investments and letters of credit related to performance bonds security deposits and other collateral deposited by our clearing firms and during 2009 we transferred an average of approximately 30 billion a day in settlement funds through our clearing system in addition our clearing house guarantees the performance of all our contracts with a financial safeguards package of approximately 93 billion as of december 31 2009 during 2009 we submitted an application to the financial services authority to become a uk recognised clearing house based on growing demand for centrally cleared solutions in global financial markets our efforts to launch cme clearing europe are intended to provide greater efficiencies to our european customer base during local market hours the emea region has been a significant source of growth for our business and we have experienced volume growth during nonus trading hours as part of our global growth strategy cme clearing europe will help to extend the safety and security of central counterparty clearing to our european clients both through our initial offering of credit default swaps clearing and additional locally relevant products we plan to offer in the future 

the clearing function provides three primary benefits to our markets a reliable credit guarantee efficient highvolume transaction processing and cost and capital efficiencies the services we provide can be broadly categorized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 market protection and risk management our clearing house guarantee of performance is a significant attraction and an important part of the functioning of our exchange 

central counterparty guarantee because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties the benefits of centralized clearing have been made even more apparent during the recent period of financial uncertainty although not a guarantee of future performance in our more than 100 year history of trading we have never had a default or a loss of customer funds resulting from the failure of a clearing firm 

performance bond requirements performance bonds are deposits that must be made by our clearing firms to ensure that they can cover potential losses in connection with their trading positions performance bonds are calculated by our standard portfolio analysis of risk span system that is used by approximately 50 exchanges and clearing organizations around the world span evaluates overall portfolio risk by calculating the worst possible loss that a portfolio of derivative and physical instruments might reasonably incur over a specified time period typically one trading day this is done by computing the gains and losses that the portfolio would incur under different market conditions additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies 

  

twice daily marktomarket process at each settlement cycle our clearing house values at the market price prevailing at that time or markstomarket all open positions and requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value our clearing house markstomarket all open positions at least twice a day and more often if market volatility warrants in select circumstances where cme has introduced clearing services to newer markets positions are markettomarket daily with the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant markingtomarket provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract having a marktomarket cycle of a minimum of two times a day helps protect the financial integrity of our clearing house our clearing firms and market participants this allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions this transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits 

segregation of customer funds regulations require our clearing firms to separately account for and segregate customers’ positions and monies from their own requirements that also extend to cme clearing if a clearing firm becomes financially unstable or insolvent due to a financial issue a customer’s funds held in such a segregated account provided the customer is not involved in the financial issue itself will not be subject to the clearing firm’s creditor claims in situations where a clearing firm were to become insolvent the customer accounts could be transferred to another clearing firm 

twentyfour hour monitoring by risk management team in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements of our clearing firms we employ more than 100 employees who use a variety of sophisticated tools to observe risk in our markets 24 hours a day six days a week these employees work closely with other teams across the organization in products and services legal and market regulation as well as with our clearing firms to help our customers manage risk during periods of economic uncertainty 

multibillion dollar safeguards package cme clearing’s approximately 93 billion financial safeguard system as of december 31 2009 is designed for the benefit and protection of both clearing members and their customers and is described in more detail on page 84 of “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

credit default swaps margining in connection with our provision of clearing services for the credit default swap market we modified our framework to address the unique characteristics of these products in addition to our traditional risk management procedures described above we use a multifactor model for margining designed to address the risk factors relating to these products 

transaction processing and position management our clearing 21 system processes reported trades and positions on a realtime basis providing users with instantaneous information on trades positions and risk exposure clearing 21 is able to process trades in futures and options products securities and cash instruments clearing 21 can also support complex new product types through clearing 21 user interfaces our clearing firms can electronically manage their positions exercise options enter transactions related to foreign exchange deliveries manage collateral posted to meet performance bond requirements and access all of our other online applications together with our order routing and trade matching services we offer straightthrough electronic processing of transactions in which an order is electronically routed matched cleared and made available to the clearing firm’s backoffice systems for further processing 

settlement collateral and delivery services we manage final settlement in all of our contracts including cash settlement physical delivery of selected commodities and option exercises and assignments because some initial and maintenance performance bonds from clearing firms as well as marktomarket obligations on some of our contracts are denominated in various foreign currencies we offer multicurrency performance bond and settlement services 

generally although most of our futures contracts are liquidated before the expiration of the contract the underlying financial instruments or commodities for the remainder of the contracts must be delivered or cash 

  

settled we act as the delivery agent for all contracts ensuring timely delivery by the seller of the exact quality and quantity specified in a contract and full and timely payment by the buyer 

to administer its system of financial safeguards efficiently our clearing house has developed banking relationships with a network of major us banks and banking industry infrastructure providers such as the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications among the key services provided to our clearing house by these banks and service providers are a variety of custody credit and payment services that support the substantial financial commitments and processes backing the guarantee of our clearing house to market participants 

crossmargining and mutual offset services crossmargining arrangements reduce capital costs for clearing firms and customers these agreements permit an individual clearing house to recognize a clearing firm’s open positions at other participating clearing houses and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at other participating clearing houses this arrangement reduces collateral deposits by the clearing firm for example our crossmargining program with the options clearing corporation which celebrated its 20 th anniversary in 2009 reduced performance bond requirements for our clearing members by an average of approximately 22 billion per day utilized in 2009 we have implemented crossmargining arrangements with the fixed income clearing corporation we also previously had an arrangement with lchclearnet group for positions at the london international financial futures and options exchange limited that were cleared through lchclearnet group this arrangement was terminated in february 2010 in addition our mutual offset agreement with the singapore exchange limited allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products and then transfer them back to the originating exchange this mutual offset arrangement enables firms to execute trades at either exchange virtually 24 hours per day 

investment services in order to achieve collateral efficiencies for our clearing firms we have established a number of collateral programs under the designation interest earning facility under this program our clearing firms may select from different programs to meet their individual needs the programs are designed to enable our clearing firms to make optimal use of the demand deposit cash accounts and security accounts they have established to satisfy their performance bond requirements we earn fee income in return for providing these valueadded services to our clearing firms 

our clearing house launched a securities lending program in 2001 using a portion of certain securities deposited to meet the proprietary performance bond requirements of our clearing firms under the securities lending program we would lend a security to a third party and receive collateral in the form of cash the majority of the cash was then invested to generate interest income the related interest expense represented payment to the borrower of the security for the cash collateral retained during the duration of the lending transaction securities on loan were markedtomarket daily and compared to collateral received in 2008 we suspended the program due to high volatility in the credit markets we continue to monitor the credit markets on a regular basis and may restart the program when conditions are appropriate 

technology 

our operation of both electronic and open outcry trading facilities and a clearing house has influenced the design and implementation of the technologies that support our operations 

trading technology we have a proven track record of operating successful electronic and open outcry markets by developing and integrating multiple evolving technologies that support a growing and substantial trading volume the integrated suite of technologies we employ to accomplish this has been designed to support a significant expansion of our current business and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our technology base into new markets products and services 

  

as electronic trading activity expands we continue to provide greater match engine functionality unique to various markets market models and product types we have adopted a modular approach to technology development and engineered an integrated set of solutions that support multiple specialized markets we continually monitor and upgrade our capacity requirements our goal is to design our systems to handle at least oneandahalf times our historical peak transactions in our highest volume products significant investments in production planning quality assurance and certification processes have enhanced our ability to expedite the delivery of the system enhancements that we develop for our customers we continue to implement technology upgrades that provide speed and functionality enhancements also our proposed transaction with bmfbovespa will further expand the breadth of our technology and distribution capabilities into the global cash equities and options markets the new platform will offer customers an integrated technology solution and we along with bmfbovespa will have the ability to license the platform to other exchanges internationally 

speed reliability scalability capacity and functionality are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms a substantial portion of our operating budget is dedicated to system design development and operations in order to achieve high levels of overall system performance in 2009 we continued our efforts to grow and enhance our electronic trading capabilities for example we successfully deployed additional functionality which provides an easy and intuitive interface that allows our customers to quickly enter and execute complex options strategies additionally in 2009 we completed the construction of our new globex control center and technology operations command center the stateoftheart facility brings the globex control center technology operations and all our other critical support teams together in one space at 20 south wacker drive bringing these teams and functions together will ensure efficient and coordinated communications proactive monitoring of markets and systems and timely incident crisis management among its critical capabilities the facility provides 24hour monitoring of our global technology infrastructure and market operations global news and market information and geographic mapping of incoming customer calls we also maintain remote data facilities to provide additional system capacity and redundancy for our trading and clearing technology our data centers support our customer interfaces trading and execution systems as well as clearing and settlement operations in 2010 our production electronic trading environment will be operational in our third data center 

the technology systems supporting our trading operations can be divided into five major categories 

 

 the cme globex electronic trading platform includes the distribution order routing order management trade matching and market data technology cme globex’s modularity and functionality enable us to selectively add products with unique trading characteristics onto the trading platform 

the distribution technologies we offer differentiate our platform and bring liquidity and trading volume to our execution facilities as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 900 direct connections with our systems for 

  

customers across the globe many of these customers connect through a dedicated private network that is readily available has wide distribution and provides fast connections in the americas europe and asia we have telecommunications hubs in amsterdam dublin london milan paris sao paulo seoul and singapore to respond to customer requests and reduce the cost of trading for our foreign customers we plan to add a hub in kuala lumpur in the first half of 2010 

in order routing and management we offer a range of mechanisms and were among the first us derivatives exchanges to implement the fix protocol—the standard order routing protocol used within the securities industry in addition our order routing and order management systems are capable of supporting multiple electronic trading match engines this functionality gives us great latitude in the types of markets that we choose to serve in 2009 we deployed an optimized order routing gateway that resulted in a significant reduction in cme globex latency we also implemented additional risk management tools for our clearing firms including providing risk administrators with manual and automated credit controls 

several key technology platforms and standards are used to support these activities including faulttolerant hp integrity nonstop blade systems ibm mainframes hitachi and emc storage area networks san equipment hp servers and cisco routers and switches for hardware our software vendors include oracle and db2 databases linux unix novell tibco middleware and multivendor network solutions 

our futures match engine design was based upon a computerized trading and match software known as the nsc system during 2009 we continued the migration of our futures products from the nsc system to our internally designed options platform in connection with our enhancement of our options engine our options match engine was designed and built at cme with focus on the speed of matching buy and sell orders and fault tolerance for 24hour trading this transition to a single match engine will bring better system performance and more opportunity for combination futuresoptions trading while allowing us to more easily and costeffectively scale our system for future growth all existing functionality is present and we expect that the migration will be relatively seamless to the end customer during 2009 we completed the migration of our fx currency futures and equities complexes and expect to complete the migration of our remaining product suites by early 2011 we continue to work on enhancements to our match engine to build a fullyfunctional electronic marketplace for unique trading demands where our customers can offset their risk with as much ease as in our open outcry trading facilities 

over the last three years we have made significant investments in market data technologies to support increased trading and messaging volumes enhancements include performance improvements scalability with a new multicast distribution platform and a fix 50 compliant messaging format these implementations benefit our customers by reducing required bandwidth and costs as well improving performance 

clearing technology clearing 21 span and cme clearport form the core of our clearing technology 

clearing 21 is a system for highvolume highcapacity clearing and settlement of exchangebased transactions the system offers clearing firms improved efficiency and reduced costs clearing 21’s modular design gives us the ability to rapidly introduce new products the software can be customized to meet the unique needs of specialized markets 

our span system is a highly sophisticated methodology that calculates performance bond requirements by analyzing the “whatifs” of virtually any market scenario developed and implemented in 1988 by cme span was the first system ever to calculate performance bond requirements exclusively on the basis of overall portfolio risk at both the clearing firm and customer level in the years since its inception span has become the industry standard for portfolio risk assessment it is the official performance bond margin mechanism of approximately 50 registered exchanges clearing organizations service bureaus and regulatory agencies throughout the world 

  

cme clearport is our flexible internetbased system that provides clearing services of overthecounter transactions the system lets market participants take advantage of the financial depth and security of our clearing house through this technology customers can conduct their own transactions negotiate their own prices and still take advantage of our central counterparty clearing 

building services 

following our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings we now own and manage real estate with approximately 15 million square feet of commercial space in the central business district of chicago and approximately 500000 square feet in downtown new york city as of december 31 2009 our real estate was approximately 94 occupied with nearly 38 of the total space used by us in the second quarter of 2009 we completed consolidation of the nymex and comex trading floors located at one north end avenue in new york city 

tenants pay market rates for rent the majority of tenant leases have terms of one to five years with large tenants generally having leases for up to fifteen years as of december 31 2009 the largest tenant in chicago other than us leased approximately 9 of the total area and the next five largest tenants leased about 14 of the total area in new york city the largest tenant leased approximately 12 of the total area we manage both the real estate and the general services relating to our real estate such as cleaning power and telephone services building services generated about 1 of our total revenues in 2009 

business continuity planning 

we continue to strengthen and upgrade our disaster recovery facilities and capabilities we have dedicated significant resources to improve our continuity planning for example our disaster recovery infrastructure and activities include 

 

  

  

  

 additionally in order to ensure proper coordination during a potential crisis we have established relationships with the local business community law enforcement and local and regional governmental emergency agencies as well as our regulators 

in 2010 our production electronic trading environment will be operational in our third data center further enhancing our disaster recovery facilities 

strategic relationships 

we continually review our growth strategy and whether it is in the interests of our shareholders to engage in discussions with other parties regarding various strategic acquisitions partnerships divestitures and other arrangements and alliances the following is a summary of our key strategic relationships 

bmfbovespa to increase liquidity and expand the international market for our customers we have established a partnership with bmfbovespa the leading exchange in latin america pursuant to an order routing agreement its products can be traded by participants connected to our cme globex platform and our products can be traded by participants connected to bmfbovespa’s global trading system platform we 

  

currently own an equity stake of approximately 5 in bmfbovespa and it owns an equity stake of approximately 18 in us on february 11 2010 we announced a nonbinding letter of intent with bmfbovespa to expand our existing strategic partnership to develop a new multiasset class electronic trading platform that will be deployed by bmfbovespa for use in its own cash equities and derivatives markets and both of us will have the ability to license the platform to other exchanges internationally the new platform will offer customers an integrated technology solution for global derivatives and nonus equities trading we have agreed to an exclusive negotiation period to enter into definitive agreements development of the new system will begin immediately and is expected to launch in early 2011 as part of the expanded partnership bmfbovespa will increase its ownership interest in us to 5 the same approximate stake we currently have in bmfbovespa consummation of the transaction is subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements approval by the regulators completion of customary closing conditions and bmfbovespa shareholder approval in connection with the proposed transaction our board authorized a plan to repurchase up to 235 million shares of our class a common stock we also agreed to nominate a senior representative of bmfbovespa to our board in connection with the closing of the transaction

dubai mercantile exchange we own an approximate 28 interest in the dubai mercantile exchange in february 2009 dme futures contracts became exclusively traded electronically on our cme globex platform the listing of the dme oman crude oil futures contract on cme globex further enhances the value proposition of dme as they seek to establish oman crude oil—which is currently used to establish the pricing of oil shipped from oman and dubai—as the leading world benchmark for pricing east of suez crude oil shipments 

green exchange venture green exchange holdings llc is a joint venture among cme and a consortium of banks and brokers the green exchange venture plans to take over a number of products currently listed on nymex once it receives regulatory approval to operate as a designated contract market current products listed on nymex include futures and options on european union allowances carbon allowances tied to the regional greenhouse gas initiative and other greenhouse gas markets 

korea exchange in 2008 we finalized our fiveyear agreement with the korea exchange to list the kospi 200 futures contract on cme globex during afterhours trading in korea trading began in november 2009 as part of the agreement we created a telecommunications hub in seoul we are also committed to pursue with the korea exchange a potential bidirectional order routing initiative that would be modeled after our arrangement with bmfbovespa 

singapore exchange limited in october 2006 we renewed our mutual offset agreement with the singapore exchange for an additional threeyear term with automatic renewals for one year each unless terminated by either party the current term is through october 2010 this relationship which has been in effect since 1984 allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products then transfer them back to the originating exchange 

as a result of our merger with cbot holdings we also list the products of the minneapolis grain exchange and the kansas city board of trade on the cme globex platform and act as their sole distributor of market data 

  

marketing programs and advertising 

our marketing programs align our core business objectives and product line goals with positioning messaging and customer targeting strategies designed to increase awareness and use of our products and services the marketing strategy and tactics include conducting market research to gather customer insight and the implementation of our marketing campaigns which may include online and print advertising direct marketing tradeshows and customer events public relations online marketing and educational programs 

our marketing programs primarily target institutional customers and to a lesser extent individual traders our marketing programs for institutional customers aim to inform traders portfolio managers corporate treasurers and other market professionals about new products and services and important uses of our products such as innovative hedging and risk management strategies we also strive to educate these users about changes in product design performance bond requirements and new clearing services we participate in major domestic and international trade shows and seminars regarding futures contracts and options on futures contracts and overthecounter clearing solutions and other derivatives products in addition we sponsor educational workshops and marketing events designed to educate market users about our products through these relationships and programs we attempt to understand the needs of our customer base and use information provided by them to drive our product development efforts 

our advertising strategies seek to increase awareness and strengthen perceptions of cme group among our institutional and retail customers as well as support an increase in our trading volume in light of the recent financial crisis we created an integrated and targeted marketing program to highlight the benefits of our central counterparty clearing model and our financial safeguards package the campaign included print advertising online marketing and educational programs additionally in november 2009 we hosted our second annual global financial leadership conference where participants had an opportunity to interact with some of the world’s leaders in business finance and politics to discuss emerging geopolitical trends and debate critical economic issues we were privileged to have paul volcker chairman of the white house economic recovery advisory board and former chairman of the federal reserve and fareed zakaria editor of newsweek international  columnist and cnn host as our keynote speakers 

our primary method of advertising has been through print media utilizing trade magazines and newsletters as well as business publications such as the wall street journal financial times and barron’s  however we also use online television sponsorship and other direct advertisements to reach our target audiences 

our targeted marketing program includes corporate and product brochures designed to communicate the depth and breadth of our capabilities our annual report to shareholders designed to showcase how key customers globally use our products to mitigate risk in addition to presenting an overview of our financial results and cme group magazine a quarterly publication designed to keep our customers up to date on developments that can enhance their successful participation in the derivatives industry the magazine features customer case histories new product information technology updates trend stories and news briefs and is made available on our web site 

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime prior to the passage of the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 cfma futures trading was required to take place on or subject to the rules of a federally designated contract market the costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation and corresponding regulatory requirements created significant barriers to entry for competing exchanges the passage of the cfma and other changing market dynamics have led to increasing competition from a number of different domestic and 

  

international sources of varied size business objectives and resources for example the cfma permits secregulated and bank clearing organizations to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that clearing organizations have traditionally cleared the cfma also permits banks and brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to offer and sell foreign exchange futures to retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act cea we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others 

competition in our derivatives business 

we believe competition among exchanges in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs 

over the past few years there have been significant changes in the industry’s landscape as a result of the wave of consolidation and increased competition at the end of 2009 there were approximately 55 futures exchanges located in approximately 30 countries including 7 exchanges in the united states additionally there has been an increase in activity among derivative dealers banks and other entities to form competing exchanges in 2007 a consortium of 12 financial institutions formed an exchange electronic liquidity exchange elx which began trading in july 2009 elx’s initial product line included electronic trading in us treasury futures in the two five and tenyear notes and thirtyyear bond contracts in competition with cbot’s treasury complex recently elx requested that the cftc compel cbot to accept certain noncompetitive trades as a means to permit two customers with equal and opposite positions at cbot to transfer those positions to elx we believe that such transactions would violate the cea and are prohibited by cbot rules at this time the cftc has not required us to take any action or modify our existing rules we expect the cftc to review the elx request we also face competition from intercontinentalexchange’s ice energy index natural gas credit default swaps equity index foreign exchange and other products new entrants into our industry may increase competitive pressure on us 

because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets we also compete with nyse euronext and other securities and options exchanges dealer markets and alternative trading systems in this product line as well as with ice in connection with its futures and options on futures contracts based on the russell indexes 

  

we face competition from the overthecounter market with the trading of contracts similar to those traded or cleared on our exchanges such as swaps forward contracts and other exchange “lookalike” contracts in which parties directly negotiate the terms of their contracts 

we also face a threat of trading volume loss if a significant number of our traditional participants decide to trade futures or similar products among themselves without using any exchange or specific trading system the cfma allows nearly all of our largest customers to transact futures or similar products directly with each other while those transactions raise liquidity and credit concerns they may be attractive based on execution costs flexibility of terms negotiability of margin or collateral deposits or other considerations additionally changes under the cfma permitting the establishment of standalone clearing facilities for futures and overthecounter derivatives transactions will facilitate the mitigation of creditrisk concentrations arising from such transactions 

competition in our transaction processing business 

in addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services we compete with other derivatives exchanges that provide clearing services ice has its own clearing operations which are comprised of five separate regulated clearing houses across the us europe and canada in march 2009 ice trust which provides clearing services for the credit default swap market acquired the clearing corporation prior to its acquisition the clearing corporation was one of the oldest independent clearing houses additionally the options clearing corporation provides clearing services for commodity futures commodity options and security futures including products listed by elx in june 2009 nyse euronext and the depository trust  clearing corporation announced the creation of a new clearing house for the clearing of fixedincome securities we believe that other exchanges may also undertake to provide clearing services 

we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the cost of the services provided quality and reliability of the services timely delivery of the services reputation and value of linking with existing products markets and distribution 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent potential competitors because as purveyors of market data these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities as technology firms they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks additionally technology and software firms that develop trading systems hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets this may lead to decreased demand for our market data 

regulatory matters 

our operations as a futures exchange have historically been subject to extensive regulation by the cftc the cftc is an independent federal agency with exclusive jurisdiction over the futures market the commission consists of five commissioners appointed to staggered fiveyear terms by the president with the advice and consent of the senate the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the cea and the cfma the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years which most recently occurred in 2008 

we are extensively regulated by the cftc in light of the widespread financial and economic difficulties particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets as a result various legislative proposals are currently circulating in congress regarding regulatory reform in the futures and the overthecounter derivatives markets these proposals are designed to 

 

   

  

 we cannot predict what the final regulations will be or what impact they may have on our business among other things the proposed legislation includes restrictions on speculative trading by means of hard position limits and limitations on hedge exemptions as well as provisions permitting the cftc to adopt a more rulesbased approach rather than our current principlesbased approach under the cftc regulatory regime the cftc has also recently issued proposed rules for comment which would establish federallyset position limits for certain energy commodities as well as limit hedge exemptions for specified participants to the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

the cfma amended the cea in 2000 and created the current principlesbased regulatory approach for regulated markets the cfma codified a threetiered regulatory structure for the trading of derivatives that distinguishes among markets based on the types of contracts traded and the sophistication of the market participants the cfma generally requires that contract markets such as our primary exchanges cme cbot nymex and comex register with the cftc and establish their compliance with 18 core principles overall compliance with the principles rule compliance and enforcement listing of contracts not readily susceptible to market manipulation trade monitoring system position or accountability limits emergency authority information availability daily publication of trading information contract execution procedures for recording and safe storage of trade information financial integrity market participant protections dispute resolution fitness standards conflict of interest management governing board composition of mutually owned contract markets recordkeeping and antitrust considerations additionally the cfma generally requires that derivatives clearing organizations like our clearing house register with the cftc and demonstrate their compliance with 13 core principles financial operational and managerial resources member and product eligibility risk management procedures and tools adequate settlement procedures treatment of customer funds member default procedures rule monitoring and enforcement systems clearing system safeguards reporting recordkeeping public information information sharing and antitrust considerations 

under the oversight of the cftc our exchanges are operated as separate selfregulatory organizations generally this requires the promotion of market integrity protection of investors and enforcement of financial requirements sales and trading practices of members cbot nymex and comex outsource responsibility for trade matching regulatory and clearing services to cme our integrated compliance and market surveillance functions allow detailed tracking of all trading and clearing activities our regulatory processes are reviewed and audited by the cftc the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders who are not members from remote locations may among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “selfregulation” that has been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program customers including high frequency traders who are guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agree to submit to the jurisdiction of our rules may be granted direct access to our trading system through their clearing firms by submitting to our jurisdiction these customers have the same obligations to comply with our rules as our members recently the securities industry has been criticized for providing its customers with unfiltered access to the market and the sec has proposed rules that effectively prohibit such unfiltered access and require brokers to implement risk controls to protect the market while we believe our policies and procedures including the availability of our risk management tool offerings address these concerns we cannot guarantee that new regulations relating to our industry will not be imposed in the future to the extent any future regulation makes it burdensome for these customers to access our market they may have less incentive to trade our products and more incentive to move to an unregulated market 

our offering to provide clearing services for credit default swaps is being made pursuant to a special exemption from the sec which is in effect through march 31 2010 we expect to have the exemption extended in the future however there is no guarantee that the sec will continue to grant us an exemption without this exemption 

  

cme and other market participants would have to comply with extensive registration and reporting requirements which may discourage market participants from clearing their credit default swap trades through us 

we have also “notice registered” with the sec as a special purpose national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading security futures products as a result the sec is authorized to review some of our rules relating to these security futures products our members trading those products are subject to registration requirements and duties and obligations to customers under the securities laws that do not pertain to their other futures business 

the proposed presidential budget has from time to time included a proposal to impose a transaction tax on futures traded domestically to fund the cftc the recently released presidential budget for 2011 did not include a transaction tax but did include a repeal of 6040 tax treatment for futures transactions this proposal also has appeared in prior administration budget plans these provisions effectively would eliminate the current tax treatment that allows traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60 at capital gains rates and 40 at ordinary tax rates additionally recently proposed legislation has included a tax on certain transactions in an effort to pay for the governmental programs instituted in response to the financial crisis and to generate additional funding for job creation in light of the financial crisis while many participants in the futures industry including us oppose these proposals we cannot guarantee that such proposals will not be enacted the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level moreover the administration’s proposal to repeal 6040 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to the individuals who are most responsible for creating liquid and efficient regulated markets

our rights to stock indexes for our futures products principally derive from license agreements that we have obtained from sp nasdaq omx and dow jones and others for a more detailed discussion of these licenses see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—licensing agreements” various other cme group products rely on license agreements from third parties we cannot assure you that competitors will not attempt to enter these markets or create similar products nor can we assure you that we will be able to renew or maintain those license agreements beyond their current terms

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the factors discussed below which are the risks that we believe are material at this time these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

risks relating to our industry 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets our trading volume is directly affected by us domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically our trading volume has tended to increase during periods of uncertainty due to increased hedging activity and needs to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however during the recent economic volatility we have experienced decreased volume due primarily to our customers decreasing their risk exposure stable low interest rates and the lack of available capital as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful this trend as well as future economic uncertainty may result in continued decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

  

the recent financial crisis and related market developments may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

we generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees declines in trading volumes and market liquidity would adversely affect our business and financial condition during late 2008 and 2009 the global financial services industry and securities markets experienced significant and adverse conditions including significantly increased volatility outflows of customer funds and securities losses resulting from declining asset values defaults on securities and reduced liquidity as a result many financial institutions required additional capital infusions merged with larger and stronger institutions became bank holding companies regulated by the federal reserve bank and in some cases failed as a result of this instability of the financial markets and the lack of readily available credit commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other of our customers decreased their risk exposure and trading volume consequently our overall trading volume in 2009 decreased 20 from 2008 on a pro forma basis to include nymex trading volume for all of 2008 we also experienced a decline in subscriptions for our market data as a result of the consolidation of our customers and employee layoffs at many of our customers if our customers further reduce their level of trading activity for any reason including a reduction in the number of traders reduced trading demand by their customers or a decision to curtail or cease speculative trading our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

we are extensively regulated by the cftc in light of the widespread financial and economic difficulties particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets as a result various legislative proposals are currently circulating in congress regarding regulatory reform in the futures and the overthecounter derivatives markets these proposals are designed to 

 

  

  

 we cannot predict what the final regulations will be or what impact they may have on our business among other things under the pending legislation there may be restrictions on speculative trading by means of hard position limits in all contracts and limitations on hedge exemptions that could affect trading volume in addition future regulations could limit speculation in our markets or permit the cftc to adopt a more rulesbased approach rather than our current principlesbased approach under the cftc regulatory regime to the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected additionally the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders who are not members from remote locations may among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “selfregulation” that has been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program customers including high frequency traders who are guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agree to submit to the jurisdiction of our rules may be granted direct access to our trading system through their clearing firms by submitting to our jurisdiction these customers have the same obligations to comply with our rules as our members recently the securities industry has been criticized for providing its customers with unfiltered access to the market and the sec has proposed rules that effectively prohibit such unfiltered access and require brokers to implement risk controls to protect the market while we believe our policies and procedures including the availability of our risk management tool offerings address these concerns we cannot guarantee that new regulations relating to our industry will not be imposed in the future to the extent any future regulation makes it burdensome for these customers to access our market they may have less incentive to trade our products and more incentive to move to an unregulated market 

  

the cftc has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with its rules and regulations we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations we also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the cftc or other agencies if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

the proposed presidential budget has from time to time included a proposal to impose a transaction tax on futures traded domestically to fund the cftc the recently released presidential budget for 2011 did not include a transaction tax but did include a repeal of 6040 tax treatment for futures transactions this proposal also has appeared in prior administration budget plans these provisions effectively would eliminate the current tax treatment that allows traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60 at capital gains rates and 40 at ordinary tax rates additionally recently proposed legislation has included a tax on certain transactions in an effort to pay for the governmental programs instituted in response to the financial crisis and to generate additional funding for job creation in light of the financial crisis while many participants in the futures industry including us oppose these proposals we cannot guarantee that such proposals will not be enacted the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level moreover the administration’s proposal to repeal 6040 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to the individuals who are most responsible for creating liquid and efficient regulated markets 

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

some of our largest clearing firms which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with the futures industry association and the us department of treasury have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish or seek to use alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchanges even if they are not successful in their efforts the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets if any of these events occur our revenues and profits would be adversely affected 

the imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business 

in connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the cfma contemplates that once certain market penetration thresholds are crossed clearing houses will establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by 

  

an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house if in the future a similar requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business will not survive 

the derivatives securities and financial services industries are highly competitive we expect that competition will continue to intensify our current and prospective competitors both domestically and around the world are numerous they include securities and securities option exchanges futures exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations market data and information vendors electronic communications networks crossing systems and similar entities consortia of large customers consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities the global derivatives industry has grown increasingly competitive exchanges intermediaries and even end users are consolidating and overthecounter and unregulated entities are constantly evolving additionally in response to growing competition many marketplaces in both europe and the united states have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth in 2007 we completed our merger with cbot holdings nyse group completed its merger with euronext and ice acquired the new york board of trade and the winnipeg commodity exchange in 2008 we completed our acquisition of nymex holdings in march 2009 ice acquired the clearing corporation an independent clearing house owned by large derivatives dealers in the last three years there has been a significant increase in activity among derivative dealers banks and other entities to form competing exchanges in 2007 a consortium of 12 financial institutions formed an exchange elx to enter the futures market which began trading in july 2009 elx’s initial product line included electronic trading in us treasury futures in the two five and tenyear notes and thirtyyear bond contracts in competition with cbot’s treasury complex recently elx requested that the cftc compel cbot to accept certain noncompetitive trades as a means to permit two customers with equal and opposite positions at cbot to transfer those positions to elx we believe that such transactions would violate the cea and are prohibited by cbot rules at this time the cftc has not required us to take any action or modify our existing rules we expect the cftc to review the elx request we also face competition from intercontinentalexchange’s energy index natural gas credit default swaps equity index foreign exchange and other products from nyse euronext and the depository trust  clearing corporation due to their creation of a new clearing house for the clearing of fixedincome derivatives as well as the options clearing corporation which provides clearing services for commodity futures commodity options and security futures including products listed by elx new entrants into our industry may increase competitive pressure on us 

we believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies the number of businesses providing internetrelated financial services is rapidly growing other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may become competitive with us through acquisitions federal law allows institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar products to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can in addition our competitors may 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

a decline in our fees or any loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

future changes in regulations as a result of the focus on restructuring the regulation of the financial markets or otherwise may adversely impact our ability to compete especially on a global basis 

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution facilities our success also depends on our ability to maintain our trading volume and to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 140 clearing firms one firm represented 11 and one firm represented 10 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for the year should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange however many of our clearing firms also engage in proprietary trading as a result of the recent financial crisis many of our customers have decreased the level of their proprietary trading additionally a proposal from the presidential administration seeks to limit the ability of banks many of which are our customers to engage in proprietary trading we cannot guarantee you that the discontinuation of any clearing firm would not result in our loss of customers a loss of trading volume as a result of the consolidation of trading accounts at the acquiring firm or as a result of decreased proprietary trading we also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to lowcost competitors with comparable or superior products services or trade execution facilities if we fail to maintain our trading volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or we lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of trading volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business and revenues will be adversely affected furthermore declines in trading volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of trading volume 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks while we generally are protected by governmental immunity for some of our marketrelated activities we could be exposed to substantial liability 

  

under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business for example the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on the world trade center resulted in the closing of nymex’s trading and clearing operations for four business days and rendered its backup data and recovery center inoperable while we have undertaken significant measures to develop business continuity plans and to establish backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to our business 

the success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or our current or potential customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected additionally we rely on our customers’ ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality to the extent our customers are not prepared andor lack the resources or infrastructure the success of our new initiatives may be compromised 

in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar occurrences if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or that resulted in erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for 

  

periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy generally our goal is to design our systems to handle at least oneandahalf times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities we could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems 

we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by breaches although we intend to continue to implement security measures these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities 

we as well as many of our customers depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers’ trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties such as independent software vendors to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform while these third parties have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that these third parties will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes in the event that these software programs do not interact with our platform seamlessly our customers could be impacted which could lead to a decrease in trading volume 

  

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs we could experience decreased trading volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties and the level of soundness of our clearing firms could adversely affect us 

cme our subsidiary owns and operates its own clearing house which acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our futures exchanges or on thirdparty exchanges for which we may provide clearing services as a result we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely guarantee transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers as a result of the recent financial crisis many financial institutions required additional capital infusions merged with larger and stronger institutions became bank holding companies that are regulated by the federal reserve bank and in some cases failed for example during 2008 the bear stearns companies inc lehman brothers holdings inc and american international group inc all of which were parent companies of clearing firms of our exchange experienced significant financial writedowns and in some cases failed although none of these cases resulted in a default of a clearing firm additional companies including our clearing firms may continue to encounter economic difficulties during this period of economic uncertainty 

as part of our overall growth initiatives we have expanded our clearing services to the overthecounter market in addition to standard futures and options on futures products including through cme clearport and our credit default swap clearing initiative the process for deriving margins and performance bonds for overthecounter products is different and in part seeks to assess and capture different risks than our historical practices applied to our futures products although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting our financial safeguards for overthecounter products there is no guarantee that our risk management procedures will adequately protect us from the unique risks of these products as we have not historically provided clearing services to this market 

we also plan to launch a separate uk clearing house following receipt of regulatory approval from the financial services authority we have limited experience operating a clearing house outside of the united states the uk clearing house will operate independently of our us clearing house and will have its own guarantee fund as part of its risk management policies and procedures 

a substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market 

to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit a certain amount of funds with our clearing house as collateral for their trading activity the funds used to satisfy these requirements may be cash or held in certain permissible investments such as regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities and assetbacked securities given the level of market volatility there is no guarantee that these investments will continue to maintain their value to the extent a clearing firm was not in compliance with these requirements it would be required to acquire additional funds decrease its proprietary 

  

trading activity andor transfer customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products 

our market data revenues may be reduced or eliminated by decreased demand overall economic conditions or the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems if we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we will experience a reduction in revenue 

we sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data totaled 3311 million representing 13 of our total revenues and 2795 million representing 11 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively a decrease in overall trading volume may also lead to a decreased demand for our market data from the market data vendors for example we believe that the decrease in the average number of devices for cme and cbot market data from approximately 296000 for 2008 to approximately 274000 for 2009 is due primarily to cost cutting initiatives at customer firms additionally electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate exchange fees for supplying market data to trading terminals if we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals we will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost market data revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees 

a key element of our strategy is to provide transaction processing services to third parties our failure to identify future opportunities to provide these services will have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business 

providing thirdparty transaction processing services is a key element of our strategy pursuant to transactionprocessing agreements we previously provided these services to nymex and to cbot prior to our acquisition of these companies we derived a significant amount of revenue from these service agreements we have entered into other transactionprocessing arrangements with bmfbovespa the korea exchange the dubai mercantile exchange and bursa malaysia derivatives we cannot assure you that such arrangements will be as profitable as our previous arrangements with nymex and cbot or that we will enter into additional agreements to provide processing services in the future our failure to capitalize on our existing arrangements and to identify future opportunities may have a negative impact on our ability to generate additional revenues and grow our business 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business including our efforts to serve the overthecounter market as discussed in the following risk factor and to distribute our products and services on a global basis there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described below through acquisitions investments or other strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

there is no guarantee that our overthecounter initiatives will be successful 

our goal is to grow our business by expanding our clearing services and product offerings to reach the overthecounter market in december 2009 we initiated our prelaunch of our clearing services for the credit default swaps market our offering is being made pursuant to a special exemption from the sec which is in 

  

effect through march 31 2010 we expect to have the exemption extended in the future however there is no guarantee that the sec will continue to grant us an exemption without this exemption cme and other market participants would have to comply with extensive registration and reporting requirements which may discourage market participants from clearing their credit default swap trades through us our strategy also includes extending our overthecounter services into other assets classes such as interest rates and foreign exchange as well as enhancing our cme clearport functionality to support additional products the current regulatory environment for trading and clearing overthecounter products including credit default swaps is uncertain we cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably in the event that future legislation or regulation adversely affects the trading of overthecounter products or reduces the demand for our offerings in addition a number of market participants and exchanges have developed competing platforms and products including intercontinentalexchange’s offering for credit default swaps we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively or that our initiatives will be successful 

we intend to continue to explore acquisitions investments and other strategic alliances we may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price 

we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company we may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships joint ventures and other alliances the market for such transactions is highly competitive especially in light of the increasing consolidation in our industry as a result we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us to the extent the trend of consolidation in our industry continues we may encounter increased difficulties in identifying growth opportunities we may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity andor debt the issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders the issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially the process of integration may also produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business to the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from strategic growth initiatives we have made or will make in the future which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results as discussed below we may also be required to take an impairment charge on our financial statements which could negatively impact our stock price 

expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our operations internationally including by establishing a uk clearing house directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

in addition as a result of our expanding global operations we will become subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities including the financial services authority in connection with our uk clearing house these may include laws rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business to date we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets we may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

generally the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which can be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years for example in 2008 a midlevel trader at societe generale engaged in unauthorized trading which cost societe approximately 7 billion and a trader at mf global one our clearing firms lost approximately 140 million in connection with unauthorized trades misconduct by our employees and agents including employees of gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that engages primarily in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents including our gfx employees also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we rely primarily on trade secret copyright service mark trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights we have filed several patent applications 

  

covering our technology in the united states and certain other jurisdictions notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights we also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law we have copyright registrations for certain of our software user manuals and databases the copyright protection afforded to databases however is fairly limited while the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable the actual data may not be and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function in some cases including for a number of our most important products there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and electronic execution services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to an investment in our class a common stock 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we may still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 23 billion of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately 08 billion 

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 

  

  

   

  

 the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt 

any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital 

our investment in bmfbovespa subjects us to investment and currency risk 

we own an interest in bmfbovespa representing approximately 5 of its outstanding shares as an exchange its ability to maintain or expand its trading volume and operate its business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject additionally its stock is valued in brazilian real which subjects us to currency risk to mitigate our financial exposure to the currency risk of the investment we purchased an option to hedge against fluctuations between the us dollar and the brazilian real with lehman brothers special financing inc as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers holdings inc in september 2008 our hedging arrangement was terminated and our currency exposure is no longer mitigated there is no guarantee that our investment in bmfbovespa will be profitable under the terms of the transaction we may not sell our shares in bmfbovespa until february 2012 

any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets or investments may result in material noncash write downs and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

in connection with our acquisitions including our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings we have recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by applying a fair value test looking at historical performance capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise in 2008 we were required to record impairment charges in connection with our investment in bmfbovespa and our swapstream acquisition in 2009 we also recorded impairment charges in connection with our ownership interests in imarex asa and the dubai mercantile exchange we may continue to experience future events that result in impairments the risk of impairment losses may increase to the extent our market capitalization and earnings decline an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results and could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our existing or future debt agreements 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

generally we have historically experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we 

  

fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure for example we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability will be adversely affected 

shareholders who own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchanges account for 20 of the 32 directors on our board these shareholders may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their rights to elect directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

twenty of our 32 directors on our board own or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchange we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result holders of our class a common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets their method of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us 

the rights of our members including the board representation rights of the members of our cme exchange to elect six directors and the rights described in the immediately following risk factor could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value 

  

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and in the case of our class b shareholders and cbot members provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are also entitled to elect six of the 32 directors on our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent we are also required to include at least 10 cbot directors as defined in our bylaws on our board until our 2012 annual meeting of shareholders and to submit changes to the rules and regulations of the cbot exchange to the cbot directors in advance for their review in the event the cbot directors determine in their sole discretion that a proposed rule change will materially impair the business of cbot or the business opportunities of the holders of the cbot memberships such change must be submitted to a committee comprised of three cbot directors and two cme directors as defined in our bylaws in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to the operation of our open outcry trading facilities and certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members

our class a common stock is currently listed on nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” as of february 17 2010 there were approximately 3097 holders of record of our class a common stock 

the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of our class a common stock on a quarterly basis as reported on nasdaq 

 

 class b common stock 

our class b common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized overthecounter market each class of our class b common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our cme exchange cme’s rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights each share of our class b common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights the memberships by class are cme chicago mercantile exchange imm international monetary market iom index and option market and gem growth and emerging markets 

class b shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold through our shareholder relations and membership services department in addition trading rights may be leased through the department trading right sales are reported on our web site although our class b shareholders have special voting rights because our class b shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our class a shares we expect that the market price of our class b common stock if reported separately from the associated trading rights would be determined by the value of our class a common stock as of february 17 2010 there were approximately 2470 holders of record of our class b common stock 

dividends 

the following table sets forth the dividends we paid on our class a and class b common stock in the last two years 

 

  

 we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders the decision to pay a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors 

  

including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant in 2009 our dividend remained at 115 per share for 2010 our quarterly dividend target is expected to remain at this level on february 2 2010 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 115 per share payable on march 25 2010 to shareholders of record on march 10 2010 assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the 2010 dividend payment will total approximately 766 million 

the indentures governing our floating and fixed rate notes our 364day credit facility for 10 billion and our revolving credit and term loan agreement for 14 billion due 2011 do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

for example under our revolving credit and term loan agreement we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of june 30 2008 on a pro forma basis to give effect to the nymex holdings merger and to give effect to the share repurchases made and special dividends paid but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid within 18 months after august 22 2008 and in no event greater than 15 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends multiplied by 065 

in addition our 364day revolving line of credit contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 125 million in the event that cme elects to increase the facility the minimum consolidated tangible net worth test will increase ratably up to 1875 million cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries including cme in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

cme group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its or their ability to declare and pay dividends

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend introduction 

our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is organized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 on july 12 2007 cbot holdings inc cbot holdings merged with and into chicago mercantile exchange holdings inc cme holdings at the time of this merger the combined company was renamed cme group inc cme group on march 23 2008 cme group acquired credit market analysis ltd a private company incorporated in the united kingdom and its whollyowned subsidiaries collectively cma on august 22 2008 nymex holdings inc nymex holdings merged with cme group the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes the financial results of the former cbot holdings beginning july 13 2007 the financial results of cma beginning march 24 2008 and the financial results of the former nymex holdings beginning august 23 2008 

references in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to cme group and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively references to “exchange” are to chicago mercantile exchange inc cme board of trade of the city of chicago inc cbot and new york mercantile exchange inc nymex collectively 

overview 

business structure 

cme group a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for cme cbot nymex and their respective subsidiaries the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme group’s class a common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” 

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities energy and metals 

  

our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

our major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platforms and our open outcry trading floors these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house 

our clearing house clears settles and guarantees every futures and options contract traded through our exchange in addition to overthecounter products cleared through cme clearport our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies 

to ensure performance of counterparties we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms and marktomarket their positions typically twice a day we also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products overthecounter products and cleared credit default swaps in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation these assets include security deposits performance bonds and any other available assets such as the proceeds from the sale of pledged class a and class b common stock and associated trading rights of the clearing firm at our exchange that are owned by or assigned to the clearing firm in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of a clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use in order cme’s surplus funds security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit 

industry trends 

economic environment our markets provide an effective and transparent means for our customers to manage risk despite the economic downturn we have experienced a decline in trading activity in the markets in which we participate due to ongoing instability in the financial markets a decrease in the availability of credit and a decline in assets under management our goal is to continue to maintain quality products and services in support of our customers while they operate within the current economic environment 

competitive environment the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others 

regulatory environment our operations as a futures exchange have historically been subject to extensive regulation in light of widespread difficulties across the economy particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets as a result various legislative proposals are currently circulating in congress outlining regulatory reform in the futures and overthecounter derivatives markets we cannot predict what the final regulations will be or what impact they may have on our business to the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

  

business strategy 

our strategy is directed towards leveraging our benchmark products clearing and trading technologies the benefits derived from our integrated clearing house as well as our scalable infrastructure we strive to capitalize on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services this strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes we believe that we can build on our competitive strengths by implementing the following strategies 

 

  

  

 primary sources of revenue 

clearing and transaction fees a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privatelynegotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for contracts executed through our trading venues because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in trading volume in addition to the industry trends noted earlier our revenues and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty this is because our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from uncertainty however in 2008 and 2009 we believe the extreme volatility and the decoupling of related markets have reduced customers’ ability to assume and maintain positions which has resulted in a decrease in volume in addition our volume can be seasonal and historically we have experienced higher sequential volume during the first and second quarters followed by decreases in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year however these patterns may be altered by the impact of economic and political events the launch of new products mergers and acquisitions as well as other factors 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence the source of revenues 

 

  

  

  

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we may periodically change fees volume discounts limits on fees and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

as a result of their rate structure total return asset contracts trakrs swapstream products hurricane risk landfall option hurlo contracts and auctiontraded products are excluded from disclosures of trading volume and average rate per contract in this discussion and analysis clearing and transaction fees on these products are immaterial relative to our other products trakrs are exchangetraded nontraditional futures contracts that trade electronically on the cme globex electronic platform auctiontraded products which included cme economic derivatives were previously traded through july 2007 swapstream products were previously traded through september 2008 

  

product mix we offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities energy and metals rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and support introduction of new products to encourage trading volume 

trading venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading platforms as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions any customer guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers executing trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platform in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on all transactions 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

quotation data fees we receive revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers our market data services are provided primarily through thirdparty distributors 

subscribers can obtain access to realtime delayed and endofday quotation trade and summary market data for our products users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our quotation data fees revenue is influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

processing services to further diversify the range of services we offer we have entered into clearing and transaction processing agreements with third parties prior to our merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 we collected fees for listing energy and metal futures products on the cme globex platform prior to our merger with cbot holdings in july 2007 we collected fees for clearing services for cbot products our processing services revenues with nymex and cbot ended upon the completion of our mergers with each entity additionally we provided clearing and risk management services for trades executed at fxmarketspace limited fxms our joint venture with thomson reuters group plc reuters beginning in 2007 until fxms terminated operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 

other sources other sources of revenue include access and communication fees and revenue from various services related to our operations 

 

   

 additionally other revenues include fees for administrating our interest earnings facility ief program trade order routing and various services to members and clearing firms we offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various ief offerings these clearing firms receive interest income and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit in addition other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by gfx corporation gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that trades primarily in foreign exchange futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products 

primary expenses 

most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume except licensing and other fee agreements and the majority of our employee bonuses 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans the bonus funded under the plans would be the “target” level if we achieve the cash earnings target established by the compensation committee of our board of directors cash earnings are defined as net income less capital expenditures and exclude taxeffected amortization of purchased intangibles depreciation and amortization expense taxeffected stockbased compensation expense valuation losses on investments tax adjustments and net interest income expense under the plan if our actual cash earnings equal 80 of the established target for a given year the bonus will be reduced by approximately 50 of the target bonus amount there will be no bonus if our cash earnings are less than 80 of the cash earnings target other than for nonexempt employees who may receive a bonus under our discretionary bonus program if our actual cash earnings equal 120 of the target or higher the bonus is increased by approximately 50 from the targeted bonus amount which is the maximum amount established by the compensation committee if our performance is between the threshold performance level of 80 of the cash earnings target and the maximum performance level of 120 of the cash earnings target the bonus will be calculated based on the level of performance achieved the compensation committee may adjust the cash earnings calculation and the target level of performance for material unplanned revenue expense or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities the cash earnings calculation for bonus purposes excludes items as approved at the discretion of the compensation committee 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to stock options and restricted stock grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of options granted fair value is derived using the blackscholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility the riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options granted 

  

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets purchased as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software as a result of our merger with cbot holdings we acquired three commercial buildings depreciation and amortization on the building and building improvements as well as other furniture fixtures and equipment acquired in the merger has been recorded since the merger closed on july 12 2007 we also acquired a commercial building in our merger with nymex holdings depreciation and amortization on this building and building improvements hardware and software have been recorded since the merger closed on august 22 2008 

amortization of purchased intangibles this expense primarily includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings as well as other asset and business acquisitions intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships licensing agreements and leaserelated intangible assets 

other expenses we incur additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

nonoperating income and expenses 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include investments in debt and equity securities for both shortterm and longterm strategic purposes and our securities lending program as well as financing activities 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these 

  

principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets derivative instruments revenue recognition income taxes internal use software costs and stockbased compensation 

valuation of financial instruments in january 2008 we adopted the accounting guidance on fair value measurements which provides direction for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities by defining fair value and establishing a framework for measuring fair value the accounting guidance on fair value measurements applies to all financial instruments that are measured and reported on a fair value basis 

the accounting guidance on fair value measurements defines “fair value” as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price the guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 

we have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into a threelevel classification in accordance with the guidance the hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows 

 

  

  

 for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 24 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets according to guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the provisions of the guidance require that a twostep impairment test be performed on goodwill in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions valuation techniques we use to measure fair value 

  

include the market approach and the income approach the market approach encompasses comparable data sets within our peer group and the income approach includes discounted cash flow measurements using a market discount rate our valuation techniques could yield variable results based on changes in assumptions such as the discount rate and longterm growth rate and forecasted revenue and expense 

indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicated by a change in circumstances pursuant to accounting guidance on impairments or disposal of longlived assets the impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value the estimate of the fair value of all intangible assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows in estimating the fair value management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows future revenues future earnings and other factors such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 

derivative investments we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets according to accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities the guidance also requires that changes in our derivatives’ fair values be recognized in earnings unless the instruments are accounted for as hedges for a derivative designated as a fair value hedge any gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change to the extent the hedge is effective together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged we record the effective portions of our derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets when the hedged item affects earnings the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss is transferred to the same line in the consolidated statements of income as the hedged item any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately any realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of income consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged 

revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies comply with accounting guidance on revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customer’s exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests occasionally market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment when these circumstances occur revenue is recognized as services are provided 

income taxes calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years as defined by accounting guidance on income taxes and accounting for uncertain tax positions as required our deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if all assets will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not 

  

be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes to tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax such as municipal interest income and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized in accordance with accounting guidance for software development costs costs capitalized are for application development or implementation as required by the accounting guidance for software projects that will result in significant new functionality and that are generally expected to cost in excess of 05 million the amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible softwarerelated activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria of the accounting guidance and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project completed internal use software projects as well as workinprogress projects are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets once complete the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software generally three years costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from year to year based on our technologyrelated business requirements 

stockbased compensation we expense stock options using the fair value method under the provisions of the accounting guidance on sharebased payments we have elected the accelerated method for recognizing the expense related to stock grants due to this election and the vesting provisions of our stock grants a greater percentage of the total expense is recognized in the first and second years of the vesting period than would be recorded if we used the straightline method we include an estimate of expected forfeitures of stock grants in our expense recognition calculations 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that changes the analysis required to determine whether a variable interest gives a company a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity this change may result in the consolidation of entities that we currently do not consolidate and requires an ongoing reassessment of the consolidation requirement in addition enhanced disclosures are required that will provide the readers of financial statements with more transparent information about a company’s involvement in a variable interest entity this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 we believe the impact of this standard’s adoption will be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

2009 financial highlights 

the comparability of our operating results for the periods presented is significantly impacted by our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings in july 2007 and august 2008 respectively in the discussion and analysis that follows we have quantified the incremental revenue or expense resulting from these transactions wherever such amounts were material and identifiable while identified amounts may provide indications of general trends the analysis cannot completely address the effects attributable to integration efforts 

  

the following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the periods presented

 revenues 

 

   

clearing and transaction fees revenues increased in 2009 when compared with 2008 and in 2008 when compared with 2007 largely due to the following 

trading volume 

the following table summarizes average daily trading volume for cbot volume information in 2007 average daily volumes have been calculated for the period from july 13 through december 31 2007 nymex product and cme clearport services volume in 2008 have been calculated for the period from august 23 through december 31 2008 all amounts exclude trakrs swapstream hurlo contracts credit default swaps and auctiontraded products 

 

  

nm not meaningful 

in 2009 when compared with 2008 the decline in average daily trading volume was largely attributable to a decrease in interest rate products and equity products volume the addition of the nymex product lines in 2008 largely contributed to the increase in average daily volume from 2007 to 2008 in addition there was a significant increase in overall market volatility in the second half of 2007 and throughout 2008 which we believe contributed to the overall increase in average daily volume from 2007 to 2008 specifically within equity products we believe the increase in market volatility during that time period was due to concerns surrounding the subprime debt market which evolved into a credit crisis in 2008 despite the decrease in average daily volume for interest rate products in 2008 when compared with 2007 total overall interest rate product volume increased in 2008 due to the addition of the us treasury futures and options acquired through the merger with cbot holdings in july 2007 

in the discussion that follows nymex product and cme clearport services volume information for the periods prior to august 23 2008 is provided for comparative purposes only and does not correspond to revenue recognized by cme group prior to that date cbot volume information for periods prior to july 13 2007 is also provided for comparative purposes only 

interest rate products 

the overall decrease in interest rate volume from 2007 to 2009 was attributable to the credit crisis we also believe the federal reserve bank’s zero interest rate policy for shortterm interest rates contributed to a decrease in volumes in 2009 when compared with 2008 

  

the following table summarizes average daily volume and changes in average daily volume relative to the prior periods for our key interest rate products 

 

 we believe that the zero interest rate policy and increased risk aversion by market participants following the credit crisis contributed to the decrease in eurodollar futures and options from 2007 to 2009 we believe this has reduced certain customers’ ability or need to assume and maintain positions 

we believe that the overall decline in us treasury note futures and options volume from 2007 to 2009 was attributable to the credit crisis which resulted in reduced corporate debt issuances reduced mortgage issuances and refinancing activity a slowdown in the us treasury cash market trading as well as the federal reserve bank’s purchase of us treasury securities the decline in 2009 when compared with 2008 was also attributable to the zero interest rate policy which we believe reduced market participants’ need to hedge interest rate risk in 2008 when compared with 2007 we believe the credit crisis contributed to some fixed income market participants shifting from longterm debt to shortterm debt which led to a decrease in volumes for products on the long end of the yield curve relative to products on the short end of the yield curve 

during the second half of 2009 overall interest rate product volume increased relative to the first half of 2009 we believe that improved economic conditions contributed to the increase in volume 

equity products 

during the second half of 2007 through the first quarter of 2009 there was significant volatility in the equity markets which we believe was attributable to concerns regarding the credit crisis average volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index increased to 33 in 2008 from 18 in 2007 average volatility decreased to 27 in the last three quarters of 2009 from 52 from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009 

average daily volume for emini equity products decreased by 19 to 26 million contracts per day in 2009 when compared with 2008 the decline in volume was primarily attributable to the decline in emini sp 500 contracts which decreased by 12 to an average of 23 million contracts per day when compared with 2008 volume for the emini nasdaq100 contracts decreased by 28 to an average of 03 million contracts per day when compared with 2008 we believe that the decline in emini sp 500 contracts and emini nasdaq100 contracts decreased due to the decline in volatility in the second quarter through the fourth quarter of 2009 when compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 in addition the decline in volume was attributable to the termination of our license to list russellbased contracts volume for the russellbased contracts averaged 03 million contracts per day for january 1 through september 22 2008 

in 2008 average daily volume for our emini equity products increased by 37 to 33 million contracts when compared with 2007 this increase included growth in emini sp 500 contracts which grew by 52 to an average of 26 million contracts per day when compared with 2007 we believe the growth in equity trading volume in 2008 when compared with 2007 was attributable to the increase in volatility the increase was partially offset by the termination of our license to list russellbased contracts volume for the russellbased contracts was 03 million per day in 2007 

  

foreign exchange products 

the following table summarizes average daily volume and changes in average daily volume relative to the prior periods for our key foreign exchange futures and options products 

 

 we believe that the volume for our euro products has remained flat and the japanese yen products has declined due to the convergence of interest rates towards zero between the european united states and japanese markets the increase in volume for the british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar products was attributable to a divergence between interest rates in the united states and interest rates in the british australian and canadian markets trading volume for foreign exchange products increased in 2008 when compared with 2007 due largely to increased volatility of the us dollar relative to other major currencies particularly the euro and the japanese yen 

commodity products 

we believe a decrease in market volatility and decreased demand for commodities products as a result of the credit crisis caused the overall decline in volume for commodities products in 2009 when compared with 2008 we believe the credit crisis has reduced certain customers’ ability or need to assume and maintain positions 

the increase in cbot corn and soybean products contributed to an increase in overall commodities trading volume in 2008 when compared with 2007 during 2008 volume for basic corn products increased by 17 to an average of 320000 contracts per day average daily volume for basic soybean products grew by 16 to 183000 contracts per day during 2008 we believe that the increases in volume were due primarily to changes in global supply and demand resulting in increased volatility as well as increased use of commodities as an asset class 

energy products 

energy products primarily consist of crude oil natural gas power and other energyrelated exchangetraded contracts and overthecounter contracts cleared through cme clearport average daily volume for energy contracts cleared through cme clearport increased by 16 to an average of 05 million per day in 2009 when compared with 2008 including the period prior to our merger we believe the increase was due to market participants seeking to mitigate counterparty risk on their overthecounter exposures through central counter party clearing 

metal products 

metal products generally include gold silver and other precious and base metals we believe metal products volume decreased by 4 to an average of 02 million contracts per day in 2009 when compared with 2008 including the period prior to our merger due largely to lower volatility and decreased demand for metal products as a result of the credit crisis 

  

average rate per contract 

cbot total volume and fees have been included beginning july 13 2007 nymex total volume and fees have been included beginning august 23 2008 all amounts in the following table exclude trakrs swapstream hurlo contracts credit default swaps and auctiontraded products 

 

 the average rate per contract increased in 2009 when compared with 2008 due to the addition of nymex products and cme clearport services to our existing product line which had an average rate per contract of 1512 and 2051 respectively in 2009 additionally the average rate per contract increased due to a lower portion of interest rate products as a percentage of total volume compared with equity products which have a higher rate per contract as a percentage of volume equity products trading volume increased by 2 in 2009 while interest rate products volume decreased by 4 when compared with 2008 

during 2008 the addition of nymex products and clearport services to our existing product lines was the primary contributor to an increase in the overall rate per contract when compared with 2007 as nymex products and cme clearport average rate per contract was 1466 and 2062 for the period august 23 through december 31 2008 the increase in average rate per contract when compared with 2007 was also attributable to a lower portion of cme interest rate products as a percentage of total volume compared with cme equity products which have a higher rate per contract as a percentage of total volume cme equity products trading volume increased by 9 in 2008 while cme interest rate products trading volume decreased by 10 when compared with 2007 in addition the overall increase in the average rate per contract was partially attributable to the full year impact in 2008 of the average rate per contract for cbot products the average rate per contract for cbot products in 2008 was 0712 the increase in average rate per contract during 2008 was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate per contract for the emini sp futures and options because incremental volume exceeded the cme globex fee cap 

volumerate analysis 

average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure which includes volumebased incentives product mix trading venue and the percentage of trading volume executed by customers who are members compared with nonmember customers due to the relationship between average rate per contract and volume the change in revenues attributable to changes in each is only an approximation using the total volume and average rate per contract data provided in the table above we estimate that clearing and transaction fees revenue increased by 3761 million due to the rise in average rate per contract and decreased by 3291 million due to the decline in total volume resulting in a net increase in revenues in 2009 of 470 million when compared with 2008 in 2008 we estimate that clearing and transaction fees revenue increased by 5175 million due to an increase in total volume and increased by 1710 million due to the increase in average rate per contract resulting in a total increase in revenues of 6885 million when compared with 2007 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 140 clearing firms one firm represented 11 and one firm represented 10 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2009 one firm represented 12 and one firm represented 10 of our clearing and transaction fee revenue in 2008 in 2007 one firm represented 

  

approximately 11 of clearing and transaction fees revenue should a clearing firm withdraw we believe that the customer portion of the firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from the loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm 

quotation data fees the increase in revenues in the periods presented were attributable to the following 

 

 incremental revenues of 592 million and 360 million generated from the nymex services in 2009 and 2008 which are included in the table above contributed to the increase in overall revenues in 2009 incremental revenues from nymex were partially offset by a decrease in cme and cbot revenues when compared with 2008 average basic device screen counts for existing cme and cbot customers declined in 2009 due largely to costcutting initiatives at customer firms the decrease in vendor audit assessments in 2009 was due to a 44 million assessment recognized in 2008 as a result of an audit of customerreported device counts this represented revenue that would have otherwise been recognized in prior periods revenues from cma services include fees for data services provided to cma customers subsequent to our acquisition of cma in march 2008 

effective january 1 2010 all users of our basic service will pay 61 per month for each device 

the two largest resellers of our market data represented approximately 55 56 and 67 of our quotation data fees in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively despite this concentration we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendor’s customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of quotation data fees directly to us 

processing services the decrease in revenues over the periods presented was attributable to the termination of our prior service agreements with cbot and nymex as a result of the mergers in 2008 and 2007 we recognized revenue of 457 million and 564 million from our trade matching agreement with nymex which was terminated on august 22 2008 our clearing agreement with cbot which was terminated on july 12 2007 generated revenues of 482 million in 2007 in addition the operations of fxms terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result we recognized incremental revenues of 64 million when compared with 2007 primarily related to fees paid by fxms for clearing and trade matching services which would have otherwise been recognized through january 2012 

access and communication fees the increase in revenues from 2007 to 2008 was attributable to the telecommunication services provided to cbot customers subsequent to our merger with cbot holdings in july 2007 the ongoing upgrade of customer bandwidth connections and expansion of our colocation program 

  

contributed to growth in revenues from 2007 through 2009 the increase in 2009 when compared with 2008 was partially offset by a decrease in trading floorrelated fees resulting from the consolidation of our chicago trading floors in mid2008 

other revenues annual increases decreases in other revenues consisted primarily of the following 

 

 from 2007 to 2009 the ief programs generated additional revenues due to an increase in the average funds invested by our clearing firm members in these programs in addition revenues generated from cbot’s building operations declined in 2009 as a result of a tenant termination fee recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the termination of fxms’s operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recognized additional revenues for fees paid by fxms for billing and regulatory services this contributed to lower revenues in 2009 and higher revenues in 2008 

operating expenses 

 

  

nm not meaningful 

compensation and benefits annual increases decreases in expenses consisted primarily of the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 communications the elimination of costs incurred to support our cbot metal products on ecbot cbot’s legacy electronic trading platform that was terminated as of july 2008 as well as improved network efficiencies as a result of the consolidation of trading systems and floor operations in chicago contributed to a decline in expenses in 2009 when compared with 2008 the decrease was partially offset by incremental expenses of 30 million generated by nymex operations in 2009 when compared with 2008 

the increase in expenses in 2008 when compared with 2007 was primarily due to the costs incurred to upgrade bandwidth for customers and consolidate our trading floor operations in addition we incurred a full year of nymex communications expense during 2009 

technology support services the decreases in expenses in 2009 when compared with 2008 were largely due to the termination of maintenance and service agreements for ecbot in july 2008 the declines in expenses were partially offset by incremental expenses generated by nymex operations 

the increase in expenses in 2008 when compared with 2007 was due to increases in software and hardware maintenance contracts including the maintenance and support of the ecbot electronic trading platform and increases in software 

professional fees and outside services costs incurred to support various strategic initiatives including our efforts to provide clearing services for credit default swaps and other overthecounter products led to growth in expenses in 2009 when compared with 2008 in addition the increase in expenses was attributable to consulting services and other outside services associated with ongoing nymex operations the increase in 2009 was partially offset by a decrease in expenses as the result of additional temporary staffing and consulting services in 2008 due to infrastructure development product support and various strategic initiatives 

in 2008 when compared with 2007 the increases in technologyrelated and other professional fees net of amounts capitalized for internally developed software were due primarily to consulting services used to supplement our merger integration efforts as well as noncapitalizable software development costs and expenses incurred to support our strategic initiatives 

  

legal fees increased in 2008 when compared with 2007 due to class action lawsuits filed in connection with the nymex holdings merger the increase in expenses was partially offset by higher legal fees in 2007 due to litigation costs related to louisiana municipal police employee’s retirement system lampers and cboe proceedings resulting from our merger with cbot holdings as well as the ongoing antitrust suit filed by eurex us 

amortization of purchased intangibles amortization increased from 2007 to 2009 due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings completed in july 2007 and august 2008 respectively 

depreciation and amortization declines in expenses in 2009 when compared with 2008 were attributable primarily to trading floor consolidation and systems integration in 2008 as well as capital expenditure reductions in 2009 the decreases were partially offset by incremental depreciation expense related to assets acquired in our merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 and incremental depreciation expense on our new data center building that we have been depreciating since august 2009 expenses increased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to assets acquired in our mergers with nymex holdings and cbot holdings in addition we accelerated depreciation in 2008 on various cbot technologyrelated and trading floor assets as well as certain nymex technologyrelated assets 

property additions are summarized below technologyrelated assets include purchases of computers and related equipment software the cost of developing internal use software and the buildout of our data centers the decrease in total property additions and technologyrelated assets as a percentage of total additions during 2009 when compared with 2008 was due to our efforts to reduce equipment and software purchases in 2009 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in purchases of assets associated with our new data center which we began capitalizing in early 2008 total additions related to our new data center for 2008 and 2009 totaled 836 million including 502 million in 2009 the useful lives associated with the new data center range from 10 to 39 years increases in property additions in 2008 when compared with 2007 were due primarily to spending for the development of our new data center and the development of our chicago office space 

 

 occupancy and building operations increases in expenses from 2007 to 2009 were attributable primarily to commercial real estate acquired in our merger with nymex holdings expenses associated with the acquired property include utilities maintenance property taxes and insurance expenses these increases in 2009 were partially offset by a decrease resulting from a reduction in temporary space in our chicago headquarters 

in addition rent expense increases in 2008 when compared with 2007 were due to additional office space in london hong kong japan and singapore as well as property acquired through the merger with cbot holdings additionally the property for our new data center was purchased in 2008 resulting in increased occupancy expense 

licensing and other fee agreements the incremental expense generated from broker rebates royalty fees and other licensing fees on nymex products contributed to the increases when compared with 2008 total broker rebates were 393 million and 136 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively increases in 2009 were partially offset by decreases in licensing fees for emini and standard equity products of 84 million due to declines in trading volume fee sharing expenses also decreased 12 million in 2009 when compared with 2008 due primarily to the sale of cbot metals products in september 2008 

  

in 2008 higher average daily trading volume for certain licensed products and additional royalty fees and broker rebates on nymex products contributed to additional expenses when compared with 2007 in addition licensing fees on emini sp and on emini nasdaq100 products contributed to the increase in 2008 

restructuring this expense consisted primarily of severance to transitional cbot and nymex employees severance to cme employees retention bonuses and associated payroll taxes as well as outplacement costs and postemployment healthcare subsidies the restructuring program related to the cbot holdings merger was substantially complete by july 2008 the restructuring program related to the nymex holdings merger was substantially complete by august 2009 

other expenses annual increases decreases in other expenses consisted primarily of the following 

 

 in addition the company’s expense reduction efforts contributed to the decreases in expenses in 2009 when compared with 2008 the decreases in expenses in 2009 were partially offset by incremental expenses incurred as part of the nymex holdings merger increases in other state and local taxes bank fees and litigation settlements including the cboe erp settlement in 2008 a higher level of general and administrative expenses resulting from our mergers also contributed to an increase in expenses when compared with 2007 

nonoperating income expense 

 

  

nm not meaningful 

investment income from 2007 to 2009 investment income declined due primarily to decreases in market interest rates throughout 2008 resulting from rate reductions by the federal open market committee the decline due to interest rates was partially offset by an increase in the invested portion of clearing firms’ cash from performance bonds and security deposits 

annualized average rates of return and average investment balances indicated in the table below include the portion of clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits we chose to invest and other shortterm 

  

investments classified as either cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheets the increase in average investment balance for clearing firms’ cash during 2009 when compared with prior years was a result of firms choosing to meet a greater proportion of their performance bond requirements with cash instead of securities the average balance of other shortterm investments is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices 

 

 the analysis presented in the table above does not include income loss on insurance contracts or gains losses on marketable securities related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans we recognized 45 million 82 million and 22 million in gains losses on marketable securities associated with our deferred compensation plans in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we exclude the impact of the marketable securities related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan from this analysis because gains and losses from these securities are offset by an equal amount of compensation and benefits expense 

dividend income from our investments in bmfbovespa and tmx group inc stock is also excluded from the table above dividend income was 158 million and 133 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively we did not earn dividend income in 2007 

impairment of longterm investments we assess our equity investments for otherthantemporary impairment on a quarterly basis at december 31 2009 we determined our investment in dme was impaired due to the excess of our carrying value over the estimated fair value as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 236 million at september 30 2009 we determined that our investment in imarex was impaired due to an extended and significant decline in the market price of its stock as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 224 million during 2008 we determined that our investment in bmfbovespa was impaired due to an extended decline in the market price of bmf stock as a result we recognized an impairment loss of 2745 million 

gains losses on derivative investments the net gain loss on derivative investments recognized in 2008 was primarily due to the loss on a put option contract purchased to hedge our risk of changes in the fair value of bmfbovespa stock resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the brazilian real we entered into the put option with lehman brothers special financing inc in february 2008 and we terminated the contract in september 2008 when lehman brothers holdings inc filed for bankruptcy 

securities lending income and expense during 2009 cme’s securities lending program remained suspended as the high volatility in the credit markets and extreme demand for us treasury securities continued expenses decreased in 2008 when compared with 2007 due primarily to the curtailment and at times suspension of our securities lending program due to increasing volatility in the credit markets and demand for us treasury securities this resulted in a decline in the average daily balance of funds invested in 2008 when compared with 2007 the increase in spread between the average rate earned and the average rate paid during 2008 was due to 

  

the combination of an increase in demand for us treasury securities which affects the rate paid and a lag effect from changing interest rates in the reinvested cash in money market funds which affects the rate earned the decrease in 2008 overall revenue and expense was attributable to the decline in average funds invested as well as the federal open market committee’s interest rate reductions 

 

 the table above does not include activity from the nymex securities lending program which closed in june 2009 under the program securities lending interest income and expense totaled 28 million and 04 million respectively for 2009 for 2008 securities lending interest income and expense totaled 69 million and 17 million respectively in 2008 we also recognized an impairment loss of 183 million on a corporate debt security held in the nymex securities lending portfolio 

in addition securities lending interest expense for 2009 included a 03 million recovery of a 60 million impairment charge related to the cme securities lending program that was previously recognized in the third quarter of 2008 the table above does not include this recovery or the initial charge 

interest and other borrowing costs the increases in interest and other borrowing costs in 2009 and 2008 were due to higher average debt levels outstanding which were the result of debt issued in august 2008 in conjunction with the nymex holdings merger these borrowings consisted of commercial paper and short and longterm notes prior to august 2008 borrowings consisted only of commercial paper 

 

 total cost of borrowing includes interest commitment fees discount accretion and debt issuance costs in february 2009 we terminated our revolving bridge facility total debt issuance costs recognized for the bridge facility during the first quarter of 2009 were 76 million including 46 million of accelerated costs resulting from the facility’s termination 

guarantee of exercise right privileges under the terms of our merger with cbot holdings holders that did not elect to sell their erps to us were entitled to a minimum guaranteed payment of up to 250000 upon resolution of the lawsuit between cbot and cboe our liability under the guarantee which was recorded at fair value in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets was estimated at 12 million and 140 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively in december 2009 final approval of the settlement occurred and we reduced our liability to zero following the resolution of the lawsuit we also adjusted the value of the 159 erps that we hold to the expected settlement value the liability decreased during 2008 due to a reassessment of possible outcomes of the litigation which resulted in a gain for 2008 the expense in 2007 was due to the establishment of the liability 

equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries the termination of our investment in fxms our joint venture with reuters in the fourth quarter of 2008 contributed to the decrease in losses in 2009 when compared with 2008 in 2008 we recognized losses from our investment in fxms of 265 million including a 159 

  

million write off of our recorded investment in fxms and our portion of the remaining capital needed to wind down operations losses in 2009 included our share of losses from our investments in dme green exchange holdings llc and onechicago the decision to terminate our investment in fxms resulted in an increase in losses in 2008 when compared with 2007 

other nonoperating expense the reduction in expenses was attributable to additional expenses in 2008 due to transfer and other transaction fees related to our investment in bmfbovespa in the first quarter of 2008 

income tax provision 

the effective tax rate was 426 in 2009 compared with 427 in 2008 and 399 in 2007 in 2009 the rate increased as a result of an additional valuation allowance of 644 million related to unrealized capital losses partially offset by a 389 million reduction in net deferred tax liabilities related to a new york city tax law change enacted in 2009 in 2008 the rate reflected a 483 million charge to record the impact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing net deferred tax liabilities partially offset by a first quarter 2008 illinois tax law change that resulted in a 386 million reduction in net deferred tax liabilities the increase in rates during 2009 and 2008 when compared with 2007 was due primarily to the state and local tax impact of our merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements until we began our commercial paper program in mid2007 we historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations while our cost structure is primarily fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on trading volume levels we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments however it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by borrowing money from financial institutions 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancelable contractual obligations as well as commitments reflected as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 these commitments are as follows 

 

  

 future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through investment in increased system capacity and performance and through technological initiatives on our electronic trading platforms each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data centers telecommunications capabilities and other operating equipment in 2010 we expect capital expenditures to total between 180 million and 200 million we continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future 

  

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders the decision to pay a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant as well as our debt instruments as discussed below cme group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its or their ability to declare and pay dividends in 2009 our quarterly dividend remained at 115 per share for 2010 our quarterly dividend target is expected to remain at this level on february 2 2010 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 115 per share payable on march 25 2010 to shareholders of record on march 10 2010 assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the 2010 dividend payment will total approximately 766 million 

sources and uses of cash net cash provided by operating activities was 11 billion in 2009 compared with 12 billion in 2008 net cash provided by operating activities decreased due primarily to decreased profitability excluding impairment charges in 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was 2573 million higher than net income this increase was due primarily to 1263 million of depreciation and amortization and 1251 million of amortization of purchased intangibles 

net cash provided by investing activities was 5448 million in 2009 compared with net cash used in investing activities of 37 billion in 2008 the increase in cash was due primarily to cash paid to shareholders in our merger with nymex holdings in 2008 of 28 billion net of cash received and a payment of 6120 million for the termination of certain nymex membership rights in conjunction with the merger the increase in cash was also due to a 3158 million net decrease in nymex securities lending program investments and a 3824 million increase in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities net of purchases in 2009 

net cash used in financing activities was 17 billion in 2009 compared with cash provided by financing activities of 20 billion in 2008 the increase in cash used relative to the prior period was due primarily to new issuances of debt of 29 billion in 2008 in conjunction with our merger with nymex holdings compared with net debt reductions of 9001 million in 2009 

debt instruments we maintain public debt of 18 billion consisting of 3000 million of floating rate notes due in 2010 7500 million of 540 fixed rate notes due in 2013 and 7500 million of 575 fixed rate notes due in 2014 the floating rate notes due in 2010 accrue interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 065 we entered into an interestrate swap agreement that effectively fixed the rate at 392 for the floating rate notes due in 2010 the proceeds from the debt issuances were used to finance our merger with nymex holdings and to repay any outstanding commercial paper borrowings that were backstopped by our 364day revolving bridge facility as well as for general corporate purposes we terminated the bridge facility on february 10 2009 in august 2009 we repaid 2500 million of floating rate notes upon their maturity 

we also maintain a 14 billion senior credit facility with various financial institutions which includes a term loan of 4205 million and a revolving credit facility of 9455 million on september 30 2009 we amended this agreement to reduce the aggregate amount of revolving credit facility commitments to 9455 million from 9955 million and to reduce the minimum required amount of each request for an increase in revolving commitments from 250 million to 100 million as long as we are not in default under the senior credit facility we have the option to increase the facility from time to time by an aggregate amount of up to 11 billion to a total of 25 billion of revolving loans with only the consent of the agent and the lenders providing the additional funds proceeds from the senior credit facility were used to pay fees and expenses and finance our merger with nymex holdings to pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing of existing debt of nymex holdings to finance dividends and stock repurchases and to support issuances of commercial paper the revolving credit facility expires on august 21 2011 

at december 31 2009 we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 8455 million 

  

we maintain a 364day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house the line of credit which was renewed in december 2009 provides for borrowings of up to 10 billion this line of credit is collateralized by clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as security deposit funds in the ief and any performance bond deposits of a clearing firm that may default on its obligation the line of credit can only be drawn on to the extent it is collateralized at december 31 2009 security deposit collateral available was 24 billion we have the option to request an increase in the line from 10 billion to 15 billion with the participating banks’ approval 

as of december 31 2009 we maintained an aa longterm credit rating and an a1 shortterm credit rating with standard  poor’s sp we maintained an aa3 longterm credit rating and a p1 shortterm credit rating with moody’s investor service the outlook for our ratings is considered stable by sp and moody’s given our ability to pay down debt levels and refinance existing debt facilities if necessary we expect to maintain an investment grade rating if our ratings are downgraded due to a change in control which results in a downgrade below investment grade we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed and floating rate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 

the indentures governing our floating and fixed rate notes our 364day revolving line of credit for 10 billion and our senior credit facility for 14 billion due 2011 do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends these documents however do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends 

for example under our senior credit facility we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of june 30 2008 on a pro forma basis to give effect to the nymex holdings merger and to give effect to the share repurchases made and special dividends paid but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid within 18 months after august 22 2008 and in no event greater than 15 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends multiplied by 065 

in addition our 364day revolving line of credit contains a requirement that cme remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets as defined in the agreement of not less than 1250 million in the event that cme elects to increase the facility the minimum consolidated tangible net worth test will increase ratably up to 1875 million 

cme group as a holding company has no operations of its own instead it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries including cme in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders 

as of december 31 2009 we are in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities 

to satisfy our performance bond obligation with singapore exchange limited we may pledge cmeowned us treasury securities in lieu of or in combination with irrevocable letters of credit at december 31 2009 the letters of credit totaled 830 million cme also guarantees a 50 million standby letter of credit for gfx the beneficiary of this letter of credit is the clearing firm that is used by gfx to execute and maintain its futures position the letter of credit would be utilized in the event that gfx defaults in meeting performance bond requirements to its clearing firm 

offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2009 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the securities and exchange commission 

liquidity and cash management cash and cash equivalents totaled 2606 million at december 31 2009 and 2979 million at december 31 2008 the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of 

  

anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices in june 2008 we approved a repurchase of up to 11 billion of cme group class a common stock over a period of 18 months which expired in december 2009 in january 2009 we suspended this program as we devoted our excess cash flows to debt reduction 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that a 143 million contribution in 2010 will allow us to meet our funding goal however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2010 and the december 31 2010 discount rate 

net current deferred tax assets of 238 million and 955 million are included in other current assets at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively total net current deferred tax assets include primarily unrealized losses and accrued expenses 

net longterm deferred tax liabilities were 76 billion and 77 billion at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively net deferred tax liabilities are primarily the result of purchase accounting for intangible assets in our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings 

we have a longterm deferred tax asset of 1459 million included within our domestic longterm deferred tax liability this deferred tax asset is for an unrealized capital loss incurred in brazil related to our investment in bmfbovespa as of december 31 2009 we do not believe that we currently meet the morelikelythannot threshold that would allow us to fully realize the value of the unrealized capital loss as a result a partial valuation allowance of 645 million has been provided for the amount of the unrealized capital loss that exceeds potential capital gains that could be used to offset the capital loss in future periods we also have a longterm deferred tax asset related to brazilian taxes of 1271 million for an unrealized capital loss incurred in brazil related to our investment in bmfbovespa a full valuation allowance of 1271 million has been provided because we do not believe that we currently meet the morelikelythannot threshold that would allow us to realize the value of the unrealized capital loss in brazil in the future valuation allowances of 516 million have also been provided for additional unrealized capital losses on various other investments 

net longterm deferred tax assets also include a 212 million deferred tax asset for foreign net operating losses related to swapstream our assessment at december 31 2009 was that we did not currently meet the morelikelythannot threshold that would allow us to realize the value of acquired and accumulated foreign net operating losses in the future as a result the 212 million deferred tax assets arising from these net operating losses has been fully reserved 

each clearing firm is required to deposit and maintain a specified performance bond balance which is determined by parameters established by the risk management department of the clearing house and may fluctuate over time performance bond requirements can be satisfied with a variety of approved investments and cash cash performance bonds and security deposits are included in our consolidated balance sheets with the exception of the portion of securities deposited that are utilized in our securities lending program clearing firm deposits other than those retained in the form of cash are not included in our consolidated balance sheets securities lending transactions utilize a portion of the securities that clearing firms have deposited to satisfy their proprietary performance bond requirements securities lending activity fluctuates based on the amount of securities that clearing firms have deposited and the demand for securities lending activity in the particular securities available to us as a result of these factors the balances in cash performance bonds and security deposits as well as the balances in our securities lending program may fluctuate significantly over time the performance bonds and security deposits for nymex clearing firms have been included in total performance bonds and security deposits subsequent to the merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 

  

cash performance bonds and security deposits and collateral from securities lending consisted of the following at december 31 

 

 we are required under the commodity exchange act to segregate cash and securities deposited by clearing firms on behalf of customers in addition our exchange rules require a segregation of all funds and securities deposited by clearing firms from exchange operating funds and marketable securities as with cash performance bonds and security deposits these balances will fluctuate due to the investment choices available to clearing firms and the change in total deposits required securities at fair value and ief funds were deposited for the following purposes at december 31 

 

 fair value measurements  we use a threelevel framework in order to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities in general we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair values of marketable securities securities lending collateral and equity investments level 1 assets include us treasury securities exchangetraded mutual funds repurchase agreements and publiclytraded equity securities if quoted prices are not available to determine fair value we use other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly assets included in level 2 consist primarily of us government agency securities municipal bonds assetbacked securities and certain corporate bonds level 3 assets include certain corporate bonds and assetbacked securities these assets have been valued using valuation models with inputs that are both observable and unobservable the unobservable inputs used in these models are significant to the fair value of the investments and require management’s judgment 

we determine the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts considered level 2 assets using standard valuation models that are based on marketbased observable inputs including forward and spot exchange rates and interest rate curves 

the fair value of our liability for the guarantee of erps was derived using probabilityweighted blackscholes option values for various scenarios the liability is included in level 3 because management uses significant unobservable inputs including probability expected return and volatility factors to determine its fair value 

financial assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2009 are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the asset or liability’s fair value measurement 

  

financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

 

 the following is a reconciliation of assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level 3 during 2009

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

debt outstanding at december 31 2009 consisted of fixed rate borrowings of 16 billion and variable rate borrowings of 07 billion commercial paper is included in fixed rate borrowings however because maturities for commercial paper are generally less than 90 days commercial paper is considered subject to interest rate fluctuations borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations were as follows as of december 31 2009 

 

  

  credit risk 

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our exchange as well as through thirdparty exchanges and overthecounter markets for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including our clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products we typically hold performance bond collateral to cover at least 95 of price changes for a given product within a given historical period our clearing house markstomarket all open positions at least twice a day and more often if market volatility warrants providing both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract this allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions this transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits in select circumstances where cme has introduced clearing services to newer markets positions are markedtomarket daily with the capability to marktomarket more frequently as market conditions warrant 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity in the unlikely event of 

  

a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation these assets include security deposits performance bonds and any other available assets such as proceeds from the sale of class a common stock and trading rights at cme cbot nymex andor comex as applicable owned by or assigned to the clearing firm in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent of a clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our surplus funds security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit we maintain a 10 billion 364day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks we have the option to increase the facility from 10 billion to 15 billion subject to approval by the participating banks we are required to post additional collateral in connection with any such increase this line of credit may also be utilized if there is a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay settlement payments between our clearing house and clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as security deposit funds in our ief program to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line 

the following shows the available assets of our clearing house at december 31 2009 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm 

 

  

     despite these safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although our foreign operations have expanded as a result of recent business combinations our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from ongoing foreign operations is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results 

we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to the equity investments noted under equity price risk any foreign currency exchange rate risk related to these investments is reflected in the equity price risk section below 

  

equity price risk 

we hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded as available for sale at their fair value equity securities whose sale is restricted for greater than 12 months are carried at original cost net of impairment charges until the restriction is within 12 months of expiration at which time they are recorded at fair value 

fair values for publiclytraded equity investments are based on quoted market prices fair values are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 

the table below summarizes our equity investments at december 31 2009 equity investments are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 

 

  

  we do not currently hedge against equity price risk equity investments are assessed for otherthantemporary impairment on a quarterly basis an assessment of whether an equity investment is otherthantemporarily impaired takes into consideration the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss at december 31 2009 we determined that none of the equity investments listed above were otherthantemporarily impaired

the board of directors and shareholders of cme group inc 

we have audited cme group inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria cme group inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion cme group inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the coso criteria  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of income shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 of cme group inc and our report dated february 26 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

building on the heritage of its futures exchanges cme cbot nymex and comex cme group serves the risk management needs of customers around the globe cme group formerly known as chicago mercantile exchange holdings inc was the first us financial exchange to become publicly traded in december 2002 we completed our acquisition of cbot in july 2007 and of nymex in august 2008 

our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments we break our member customers into four segments based on trading activity bank proprietary trading large hedge funds buyside proprietary trading firms and “other” which includes thousands of smaller member firms and individual traders we also have a fifth segment of customers which is comprised of our nonmember customers who pay higher fees than the member category

financial safeguards 

we own our own clearing house – cme clearing our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and soundness of our markets cme clearing protects the financial integrity of our markets by serving as the counterparty to every trade – becoming the buyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer – and limiting credit risk it is responsible for settling trading accounts clearing trades collecting and maintaining performance bond funds regulating delivery and reporting trading data cme clearing limits accumulation of debt from trading losses with twice daily marktomarket settlement 

in 2008 tumultuous market conditions were driven by concerns about counterparty credit during such times our financial safeguards continued to provide our customers with transparency and liquidity in all asset classes despite the failure of a number of financial institutions in 2008 none of our customers incurred a financial loss due to a counterparty failure we are extending the benefits of our model to the overthecounter market through cme clearport our internetbased system for clearing overthecounter transactions we also plan to provide clearing services for credit default swaps in connection with our proposed joint venture with citadel investment group llc citadel as discussed below in the section entitled “growth strategy—serving the overthecounter markets” as of december 31 2008 we acted as custodian for approximately 1161 billion in performance bond security deposit and other collateral of which 169 billion was in excess of the requirements performance bonds are deposits required from our clearing firms to ensure that they can cover potential losses in connection with their trading positions we require these deposits as part of our financial safeguards to help ensure that clearing firms can meet their obligations to their customers and to cme clearing 

ownership of our clearing house also enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development technology market regulation and other risk management activities 

history 

cme was founded in 1898 as a notforprofit corporation in november 2000 cme demutualized and became a shareholderowned corporation as a consequence we adopted a forprofit approach to our business including strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing trading volume efficiency and liquidity in december 2002 cme holdings completed its initial public offering of its class a common stock and became the first us financial exchange to be publicly traded in july 2007 cme holdings completed its merger with cbot holdings as a result we acquired cbot cbot is a leading marketplace for trading agricultural and us treasury futures as well as options on futures in august 2008 we merged with nymex holdings and acquired nymex and comex its whollyowned subsidiary on the nymex exchange customers primarily trade energy futures and options contracts including contracts for crude oil natural gas heating oil and gasoline on comex customers trade metals futures and options contracts including contracts for gold silver copper and aluminum 

our principal executive offices are located at 20 south wacker drive chicago illinois 60606 and our telephone number is 3129301000 

  

growth strategy 

increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services create significant opportunities for growth we believe that we can capitalize on these trends and build on our competitive strengths by implementing the following strategies 

 

  

  

 growing the core business we intend to advance our position as a leader in the futures industry by growing and diversifying our customer base and trading volumes as part of this initiative we plan to continue to generate organic growth through the launch of new products we have a strong track record of innovation continually launching new products and product line extensions 

we plan to continue to work with existing and potential customers to develop new futures and options products that provide an array of relevant risk management tools we are also enhancing our marketing capabilities with a focus on customer education and public relations to cross sell our existing products we continue to communicate our unique benefits – a secure effective and costefficient place for customers to come and manage their risk through our diverse products liquidity anonymity and central counterparty clearing we continue to look for ways to build upon our success as we continue to grow our business in areas such as emerging markets and the overthecounter market 

globalizing the business our goal is to expand and diversify our customer base worldwide and offer customers around the world the most broadly diversified portfolio of benchmark products in 2008 we continued our initiative to enhance our global marketing efforts in order to broaden the understanding of the benefits of our products targeting in particular asia and europe 

in 2008 we completed our merger with nymex holdings which adds energy and metals to our already diverse product set as a combined company we are better positioned to compete globally with cash overthecounter and regulated markets and participate in the fastgrowing global energy market we believe there is potential growth in nymex’s energy and metals complexes when combined with our global reach and strategic oversight nymex has also been developing significant new joint ventures and commercial relationships on a global basis which will enhance our ability as a combined company to jointly market and crosssell our diverse products across an even broader customer base around the globe while cme group has historically been active in the united states europe latin america and asia nymex has been actively pursuing growth in europe and the middle east in february 2009 the dubai mercantile exchange dme futures contracts became exclusively traded electronically on the cme globex platform 

we also seek to deploy our technology and transaction processing services globally in 2008 we continued to deliver on this strategic initiative furthering our agreement with bmf with an order routing agreement pursuant to our order routing agreement bmf products can be traded by participants connected to our cme globex platform and cme group products can be traded by participants connected to bmf’s global trading system platform several independent software vendors have established connectivity and our telecommunications hub in brazil became operational in connection with this initiative we also finalized our agreement to list the kospi 200 futures contracts on cme globex during nighttime trading hours in korea 

we will continue to explore opportunities to position cme group to benefit from growth in key geographies by targeting global customers through strategic investments and by leveraging our diverse product offerings 

serving the overthecounter markets we intend to continue our initiatives to expand our business into overthecounter markets by developing overthecounter products and services and by entering these markets through acquisitions strategic partnerships and commercial arrangements as a result of our merger with nymex holdings in 2008 we now own clearport cme clearport is the mechanism by which individually negotiated offexchange trades are submitted for clearing this platform provides additional clearing functionality for overthecounter transactions to reduce counterparty risk and create capital efficiencies 

as part of our overthecounter initiatives in 2008 we also announced that we would pursue trading and clearing of credit default swaps in this initiative credit market derivatives exchange llc cmdx a joint venture company that we agreed to form with citadel will offer a platform for migration of existing and new credit default swaps to cme clearing which will also be able to receive trades in credit default swaps directly from participants cmdx will also offer an optional electronic trade matching platform for credit default swaps these initiatives will bring the benefits of multilateral netting and centralized clearing and risk management to the credit default swaps market in december 2008 we completed regulatory reviews with the federal reserve bank of new york and the cftc we have been working with citadel and potential market participants to bring this offering to market pending completion of the sec’s review of our request for exemptive relief and the completion of discussions and testing with market participants we plan to launch cmdx and cme clearing services for credit default swaps 

  

in march 2008 we acquired credit market analysis limited cma a leading provider of credit derivatives market data cma currently offers two products cma quotevision and cma datavision to overthecounter credit derivatives market participants primarily focused on asset managers hedge funds and other buyside participants 

in 2008 we also launched cme cleared swaps which offer the first ever centrallycleared interest rate swap to all market participants and filed a petition with the cftc seeking approval to clear corn basis swaps and calendar swaps for corn wheat and soybeans 

products 

we believe that the range and diversity of our products contribute significantly to our success we offer markets in futures and options on futures contracts based on the us interest rate yield curve equity indexes foreign exchange agricultural commodities energy metals and alternative investment products our products are traded through the cme globex electronic trading platform our open outcry auction markets in chicago and new york city or through privately negotiated transactions that we clear for the year ended december 31 2008 we derived 21 billion or 83 of our total revenues from fees associated with trading and clearing our products these fees include per contract charges for trade execution clearing and cme globex fees fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded the method of trade and the trading privileges of the customer making the trade generally members are charged lower fees than nonmembers certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our efforts to encourage increased liquidity in our markets our markets also generate valuable data and information regarding pricing and trading activity in our products we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” page 56 for the average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product lines for the last three years although dislocations in credit and lending markets have significantly impacted our interest rate complex our other product lines especially equity indexes showed solid volume growth in 2008 looking forward we will continue to focus on expense discipline while providing customers with the best ways to manage risk at a time of economic uncertainty 

interest rate products our interest rate products enable banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks and in turn help to reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing our interest rate products allow our customers to execute transactions across the entire us dollardenominated yield curve using some of the world’s most actively traded futures and options products customers may manage short medium and longterm interest rate risk using our products based on eurodollars us treasuries swaps and other dollarrelated instruments as a result of our acquisition of cbot our interest rate products include cbot’s thirtyyear us treasury bond futures and options on futures tenyear fiveyear and twoyear us treasury note futures and options and interest rate swap futures and options and federal funds futures and options 

fiftytwo percent of our overall annual trading volume in 2008 and 38 of our clearing and transaction fees was based upon our interest rate products the overall volume of our interest rate product line was down compared with 2007 the decrease was as a result of decreased trading in our eurodollar options contract due to increased volatility in the relationship between the london interbank offered rate libor and the overnight federal funds effective rate declining correlations between risk free treasury rates and spread products a slowdown in corporate debt and mortgage originations industry consolidation declining assets under management a severe decrease in mortgagerelated structured product transactions and pressure resulting from failures in the repo market 

in 2009 we believe that our interest rate product line will continue to be negatively impacted by the current state of the economy and a zero interest rate policy we believe that this decline could be partially offset by the increased treasury issuances and the need to manage the associated interest rate risks as well as transitions to exchange traded and cleared products by overthecounter participants in response to heightened concerns about counterparty risk and the need for greater balance sheet efficiencies 

equity products our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure for hedging or speculative purposes to changes in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities by allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks our equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets 

we are a leading equity index marketplace offering futures and options products including our emini contracts on key benchmark equity indexes covering small medium and largecap companies in the us europe and asia these include the standard  poor’s dow jones nasdaq nikkei msci and ftsexinhua indexes and others we have exclusive licensing arrangements with standard  poor’s corporation sp nasdaq omx group inc nasdaq omx and dow jones  company inc dow jones which allow us to offer futures and options on futures on their indexes including our contracts based on the sp 500 index the nasdaq100 index and the dow jones industrial average for a detailed description of these licensing arrangements see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—licensing agreements” 

  

trading in these products represented 31 of our total trading volume and 32 of our clearing and transaction fees during 2008 

we believe our leading market position in equity products is a result of the liquidity of our markets the status of the sp 500 the nasdaq100 and the dow jones industrial average indexes as the principal us financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns and the appeal to investors and traders of our emini products and other equity products and our cme globex platform these investors include public and private pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets 

we believe future growth in our equity products will come from increased counterparty credit concerns continued education of our customers as to the benefits of our equity product portfolio to serve their risk management needs and the benefits of futures products over cash equities we believe that our equity volumes may also be impacted by the trading volume levels of the underlying markets as well as their level of volatility 

foreign exchange products we became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in 1972 our foreign exchange market serves as an effective and efficient means of risk transfer for the global foreign exchange market bringing together a broad array of client segments by offering investment as well as risk management opportunities our customers benefit from dealing anonymously in a fully transparent market where large and small customers have equal access to the same prices and deep pool of liquidity our foreign exchange products provide the tools and resources to hedge foreign exchange risk facilitating crossborder trade and commerce while mitigating the risks to profitability due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market our foreign exchange market attracts both buy and sellside investors including commercial and investment banks hedge funds commodity trading advisors proprietary trading firms and individual investors approximately 95 of our foreign exchange products are traded electronically on the cme globex platform ensuring that business is transacted quickly with maximum operational efficiency 

today we offer approximately 40 foreign exchange futures and approximately 30 foreign exchange options on futures products covering major as well as a broad array of emerging market currency pairs in more than 20 different currencies 

in 2008 we saw an average daily volume of 623000 foreign exchange contracts per day with a notional value of 845 billion a day trading in our foreign exchange products represented 5 of our total trading volume in 2008 and 7 of our clearing and transaction fees 

we believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and diversifying our product suite and customer base for example trading in volatilitybased options on six of our foreign exchange options began in march 2008 we are expanding our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array of customer segments and we expect continued strong growth in the electronic execution of foreign exchange options on cme globex in 2009 as we expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market we expect increased trading volume from customers outside of the united states we also expect an increased demand in the overthecounter market for cleared products which we are targeting firms however have reduced their foreign exchange trading volume in light of the current economic conditions and consolidation within the industry 

commodity and alternative investment products our commodity products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management these products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities including agricultural producers of commodities food processors and consumers of energy commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business we have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products including futures contracts based on cattle hogs pork bellies lumber dairy products soybeans corn wheat oats and rough rice following our acquisition of nymex we also offer contracts based on crude oil natural gas heating oil gasoline copper and aluminum as well as other soft commodities our energy products offer a way for producers marketers and refiners to manage fuel price risk in a volatile growing market faced with mounting regulatory and market pressures in september 2008 we sold the cbot metals trading complex to nyse euronext 

we also provide our customers with nontraditional alternative investment products to diversify and manage their risk our real estate products provide opportunities for risk protection and extend to the real estate industry the same financial tools that our previous innovations have brought to agriculture and finance by providing a means of hedging exposure to real estate prices customers can diffuse the potential impact of sustained declines in real estate prices we also are the only regulated exchange that offers risk management products on the weather market through our weather contracts based on aggregate temperatures in more than 40 cities around the world as well as hurricane snowfall and frost indexes 

commodity and alternative investment products accounted for 12 of our trading volume and 23 of our clearing and transaction fees during 2008 

  

we continue to execute our strategy of growing our customer base and providing sidebyside access to our commodity markets we believe the changing perception of commodities as an asset class provides an opportunity for growth in our markets we also anticipate growth in our energy products as a result of price volatility increased use of cme clearport due to credit concerns and continued enhancements to our product portfolio however we believe that increases in volume may be offset by the negative impact of the current economic situation 

market data and information products our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products that we believe enhances the appeal of our products the dissemination of realtime data generates revenues and supports our customer base with timely market information we sell our market data which includes information about bids offers trades and trade size in our products to banks brokerdealers pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions we distribute our market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets through our electronic facilities we also distribute market data via dedicated networks to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges other third party data providers and news services and then resell their consolidated data revenues from market data products totaled 2795 million or 11 of our total revenues in 2008 

sophisticated quantitative approaches to risk management as well as customer time sensitivity have created new needs uses and demands for tradingrelated data and analytics this timely information has become even more important in light of the volatility and uncertainty in today’s markets we continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by creating new valueadded services to complement our market data products including databases analytical tools and other services to assist endusers in 2008 we launched the latest version of equotes a realtime streaming market data application that offers quotes charting advanced analytics and news on cme group traded products equotes will enable users to access prices for all cme group listings additionally to expand our market data product offerings in 2008 we purchased cma cma provides credit market pricing data and intraday services to increase productivity efficiency and speed of transactions in the overthecounter markets 

as part of our market data and information products business we also supply services to sp and onechicago our joint venture with the chicago board options exchange inc cboe and interactive brokers group in connection with the usage reporting contract administration and associated billing and revenue collection for the display and integration of their market data into our standard market data distribution we are the exclusive distributor of dow jones index data from our market data distribution platform we also provide access to all prices for products listed on the minneapolis grain exchange and the kansas city board of trade which are available for electronic trading on cme globex 

we believe that there has been a decline in subscriptions of market data due primarily to the consolidation of many of our customers and related headcount reductions as a result of the current financial crisis for example the number of subscriptions for devices for cme and cbot market data combined decreased from 293000 at december 31 2007 to 290000 december 31 2008 to the extent that our customers continue to consolidate we could experience further declines in our market data revenues derived from such subscriptions 

execution 

our primary trade execution facilities consist of our cme globex electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors in chicago and new york city these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency and are supported by substantial infrastructure and technology for order routing trade reporting market data dissemination and market surveillance and regulation in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house 

electronic trading our cme globex electronic trading platform maintains an electronic centralized order book and trade execution algorithm for futures contracts and options on futures contracts and allows users to enter orders directly into the order book in january 2008 we completed the migration of cbot’s products to the cme globex platform pursuant to a previously existing transactionprocessing services agreement we began listing nymex’s products on our platform in 2006 

in 2008 79 of our average daily trading volume was executed electronically compared with 78 in 2007 during 2008 approximately 76 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from electronic trading 

open outcry trading we also offer our members the ability to execute transactions in an openauction format on our trading floors—a centralized meeting place for traders and floor brokers to trade our products orders by market participants not physically located on the trading floor are communicated to floor brokers current market information and news are displayed on wallboards hung above the trading pits in the second quarter of 2008 we integrated the cme and cbot trading floors at one location at 141 west jackson boulevard in chicago as a result of our acquisition of nymex we now operate open outcry trading in new york city at one north end avenue we plan to integrate the nymex and comex trading floors into one floor in the second quarter of 2009 open outcry trading represented 15 of our average daily trading volume in 2008 and accounted for approximately 14 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue 

  

privately negotiated and over thecounter transactions in addition to offering traditional open outcry and electronic trading through the cme globex platform we permit qualified customers to trade our products by entering into privately negotiated transactions which are reported and included in the market data we distribute we also clear settle and guarantee these transactions through our clearing house and cme clearport these off exchange transactions provide our customers with the flexibility to negotiate their own prices and still take advantage of our financial safeguards during 2008 approximately 10 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from this type of trading 

clearing 

we operate our own clearing house—cme clearing—that clears settles and guarantees the performance of all transactions matched through our execution facilities and on third party exchanges for which we provide clearing services our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and soundness of our markets ownership and control of our own clearing house also enables us to retain the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products by owning our clearing house we control the cost structure and the technology development cycle for our clearing services it helps us manage our new product initiatives without being dependent on an outside entity it also benefits our customers by creating operational risk management and product benefits additionally owning our own clearing house allows us to generate additional revenue by providing clearing services to other exchanges up until the closing of the merger with cbot holdings we provided clearing services to cbot 

in 2008 our clearing house cleared an average of 110 million contracts daily and 30 billion contracts overall as of december 31 2008 we acted as custodian for approximately 1161 billion in performance bond security deposit and other collateral deposited by our clearing firms and during 2008 we transferred an average of approximately 44 billion a day in settlement funds through our clearing system we are recognized by the united kingdom’s financial services authority as a recognised overseas clearing house which enables us to provide global clearing services to market participants in the united kingdom and serve a wider range of those customers’ risk management needs in addition our clearing house guarantees the performance of all our contracts with a financial safeguards package of approximately 66 billion as of december 31 2008 

the clearing function provides three primary benefits to our markets a reliable credit guarantee efficient highvolume transaction processing and cost and capital efficiencies the services we provide can be broadly categorized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 market protection and risk management our clearing house guarantee of performance is a significant attraction and an important part of the functioning of our exchange 

central counterparty guarantee because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties the benefits of centralized clearing have been made even more apparent during the recent financial uncertainty although not a guarantee of future performance in our more than 100 year history of trading we have never had a default or a loss of customer funds resulting from the failure of a clearing firm 

performance bond requirements performance bonds are deposits required from our clearing firms to ensure that they can cover potential losses in connection with their trading positions performance bonds are calculated by our standard portfolio analysis of risk span system that is used by about 50 exchanges and clearing organizations around the world span evaluates overall portfolio risk by calculating the worst possible loss that a portfolio of derivative and physical instruments might reasonably incur over a specified time period typically one trading day this is done by computing the gains and losses that the portfolio would incur under different market conditions additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies 

twice daily marktomarket process at each settlement cycle our clearing house values at the market price prevailing at that time or markstomarket all open positions and requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value our clearing house markstomarket all open positions at least twice a day and more often if market volatility warrants markingtomarket provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract having a marktomarket cycle of a minimum of two times a day helps 

  

protect the financial integrity of our clearing house our clearing firms and market participants this allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions this transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits 

segregation of customer funds regulations require our clearing firms to separately account for and segregate customers’ positions and monies from their own requirements that also extend to cme clearing if a clearing firm becomes financially unstable or insolvent due to a financial issue a customer’s funds held in such a segregated account provided they are not involved in the financial issue itself will not be subject to the clearing firm’s creditor claims in situations where a clearing firm were to become insolvent the customer accounts could be transferred to another clearing firm 

twentyfour hour monitoring by risk management team in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements of our clearing firms we employ approximately 100 employees who use a variety of sophisticated tools to observe risk in our markets 24 hours a day six days a week these employees work closely with other teams across the organization in products and services legal and market regulation as well as with our clearing firms to help our customers manage risk during periods of economic uncertainty 

multibillion dollar safeguards package cme clearing’s approximately 66 billion financial safeguard system as of december 31 2008 is designed for the benefit and protection of both clearing members and their customers and is described in more detail on page 71 of “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

credit default swaps margining regime in connection with our decision to enter the market for clearing credit default swaps we modified our framework to address the unique characteristics of this product in addition to our traditional risk management procedures described above we will be using a multifactor model for margining designed to address the unique risk factors relating to these products 

transaction processing and position management  our clearing 21 system developed with nymex in the early 1990s processes reported trades and positions on a realtime basis providing users with instantaneous information on trades positions and risk exposure clearing 21 is able to process trades in futures and options products securities and cash instruments clearing 21 can also support complex new product types including combinations options on combinations options on options swaps repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other instruments through clearing 21 user interfaces our clearing firms can electronically manage their positions exercise options enter transactions related to foreign exchange deliveries manage collateral posted to meet performance bond requirements and access all of our other online applications together with our order routing and trade matching services we offer straightthrough electronic processing of transactions in which an order is electronically routed matched cleared and made available to the clearing firm’s backoffice systems for further processing 

settlement collateral and delivery services we manage final settlement in all of our contracts including cash settlement physical delivery of selected commodities and option exercises and assignments because some initial and maintenance performance bonds from clearing firms as well as marktomarket obligations on some of our contracts are denominated in various foreign currencies we offer multicurrency performance bond and settlement services 

generally although most of our futures contracts are liquidated before the expiration of the contract the underlying financial instruments or commodities for the remainder of the contracts must be delivered we act as the delivery agent for all contracts ensuring timely delivery by the seller of the exact quality and quantity specified in a contract and full and timely payment by the buyer 

to administer its system of financial safeguards efficiently our clearing house has developed banking relationships with a network of major us banks and banking industry infrastructure providers such as the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications among the key services provided to our clearing house by these banks and service providers are a variety of custody credit and payment services that support the substantial financial commitments and processes backing the guarantee of our clearing house to market participants 

crossmargining and mutual offset services crossmargining arrangements reduce capital costs for clearing firms and customers these agreements permit an individual clearing house to recognize a clearing firm’s open positions at other participating clearing houses and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at other participating clearing houses this arrangement reduces the need for collateral deposits by the clearing firm for example our crossmargining program with the options clearing corporation reduced performance bond requirements for our members by an average of approximately 15 billion per day utilized in 2008 we have implemented crossmargining arrangements with the fixed income clearing corporation and lchclearnet group for positions at the london international financial futures and options exchange limited that are cleared through lchclearnet group in addition our mutual offset agreement with the singapore exchange allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products and then transfer them back to the originating exchange this mutual offset arrangement enables firms to execute trades at either exchange virtually 24 hours per day this arrangement has been in place since 1984 and was renewed in october 2006 for an additional threeyear term with automatic renewals for one year each unless terminated by either party 

  

investment services in order to achieve collateral efficiencies for our clearing firms we have established a number of collateral programs under the designation interest earning facility ief under this program our clearing firms may select from four different ief programs to meet their individual needs the programs are designed to enable our clearing firms to make optimal use of the demand deposit cash accounts and security accounts they have established to satisfy our performance bond requirements we earn fee income in return for providing these valueadded services to our clearing firms 

our clearing house launched a securities lending program in 2001 using a portion of certain securities deposited to meet the proprietary performance bond requirements of our clearing firms under this securities lending program we lend a security to a third party and receive collateral in the form of cash the majority of the cash is then invested to generate interest income the related interest expense represents payment to the borrower of the security for the cash collateral retained during the duration of the lending transaction securities on loan are markedtomarket daily and compared to collateral received the cme program is currently suspended due to high volatility in the credit markets 

technology 

our operation of both electronic and open outcry trading facilities and a clearing house has influenced the design and implementation of the technologies that support our operations 

trading technology we have a proven track record of operating successful electronic and open outcry markets by developing and integrating multiple evolving technologies that support a growing and substantial trading volume the integrated suite of technologies we employ to accomplish this has been designed to support a significant expansion of our current business and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our technology base into new markets products and services 

as electronic trading activity expands we continue to provide greater match engine functionality unique to various markets market models and product types we have adopted a modular approach to technology development and engineered an integrated set of solutions that support multiple specialized markets we continually monitor and upgrade our capacity requirements our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our historical peak transactions in our highest volume products significant investments in production planning quality assurance and certification processes have enhanced our ability to expedite the delivery of the system enhancements that we develop for our customers in january 2008 we completed the migration of cbot products onto the cme globex platform we continue to implement technology upgrades that provide speed and functionality enhancements for our customers in the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed server upgrades for our interest rate match engines to allow for sizeable speed improvements and the launch of implied intercommodity spreads for treasury futures and swap futures 

speed reliability scalability capacity and functionality are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms a substantial portion of our operating budget is dedicated to system design development and operations in order to achieve high levels of overall system performance in 2008 we continued our efforts to grow and enhance our electronic trading capabilities for example we enhanced our cme globex credit controls to provide preexecution risk controls that enable our customers to set defined trading limits and select realtime notifications if those limits are exceeded including email notification order blocking and order cancellation we also maintain remote data facilities to provide additional system capacity and redundancy for our trading and clearing technology our data centers support our customer interfaces trading and execution systems as well as clearing and settlement operations 

the technology systems supporting our trading operations can be divided into five major categories 

 

   

the cme globex electronic trading platform includes the distribution order routing order management trade matching and market data technology cme globex’s modularity and functionality enable us to selectively add products with unique trading characteristics onto the trading platform 

the distribution technologies we offer differentiate our platform and bring liquidity and trading volume to our execution facilities as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 980 direct connections with our systems for customers across the globe many of these customers connect through a dedicated private network that is readily available has wide distribution and provides fast connections in the americas europe and asia we have telecommunications hubs in amsterdam dublin london milan paris sao paulo and singapore to respond to customer requests and reduce the cost of trading for our foreign customers we plan to add hubs in seoul and shanghai 

in order routing and management we offer a range of mechanisms and were among the first us derivatives exchanges to implement the fix protocol—the standard order routing protocol used within the securities industry in addition our order routing and order management systems are capable of supporting multiple electronic trading match engines this functionality gives us great latitude in the types of markets that we choose to serve 

several key technology platforms and standards are used to support these activities including faulttolerant hewlett packard integrity nonstop servers that incorporate intel itanium processors ibm mainframes microsoft software hitachi and emc storage area network san equipment sun microsystems and hewlett packard servers oracle and db2 databases linux unix novell tibco middleware and multivendor network solutions 

our futures match engine design was based upon a computerized trading and match software known as the nsc system we are in the early stages of enhancing our options engine to support the migration of our futures products from the nsc system to our internally designed options platform our options match engine was designed and built at cme with focus on the speed of matching buy and sell orders and fault tolerance for 24hour trading this transition to a single match engine will bring better system performance and more opportunity for combination futuresoptions trading while allowing us to more easily and costeffectively scale our system for future growth all existing functionality will be present and we expect that the migration will be relatively seamless to the end customer in february 2009 we migrated our fx currency futures to the options platform and plan to move our other product lines to the system in the future we continue to work on enhancements to our match engine to build a fullyfunctional electronic marketplace for unique trading demands where our customers can offset their risk with as much ease as in our open outcry trading facilities 

over the last three years we have made significant investments in market data technologies to support increased trading and messaging volumes enhancements include performance improvements scalability with a new multicast distribution platform and a fix 50 compliant messaging format these implementations benefit our customers through reducing required bandwidth and costs as well improving performance 

clearing technology clearing 21 our clearing and settlement software span our margining and risk management software and cme clearport form the core of our clearing technology 

clearing 21 is a system for highvolume highcapacity clearing and settlement of exchangebased transactions that we developed jointly with nymex in the early 1990s the system offers clearing firms improved efficiency and reduced costs clearing 21’s modular design gives us the ability to rapidly introduce new products the software can be customized to meet the unique needs of specialized markets 

our span system is a highly sophisticated methodology that calculates performance bond requirements by analyzing the “whatifs” of virtually any market scenario developed and implemented in 1988 by cme span was the first system ever to calculate performance bond requirements exclusively on the basis of overall portfolio risk at both the clearing firm and customer level in the years since its inception span has become the industry standard for portfolio risk assessment it is the official performance bond margin mechanism of 50 registered exchanges clearing organization service bureaus and regulatory agencies throughout the world 

cme clearport is our flexible internetbased system we acquired through our acquisition of nymex that provides clearing services of overthecounter transactions the system lets market participants take advantage of the financial depth and security of our clearing house through this technology customers can conduct their own transactions offexchange negotiate their own prices and still take advantage of our central counterparty clearing 

building services 

following our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings we now own and manage real estate with approximately 15 million square feet of commercial space in the central business district of chicago and approximately 500000 square feet in downtown new york city as of december 31 2008 our real estate was approximately 95 occupied with nearly 40 of the total space used by us in 2008 we completed the renovations of the cbot trading floor and migrated the cme trading floors from 20 south wacker drive to 141 west jackson boulevard in chicago we expect to consolidate the nymex and the comex trading floors located at one north end avenue in new york city in the second quarter of 2009 

  

tenants pay market rates for rent the majority of tenant leases have terms of three to five years with large tenants generally having leases for up to fifteen years as of december 31 2008 the largest tenant in chicago other than us leased approximately 8 of the total area and the next five largest tenants leased about 14 of the total area in new york city the largest tenant leased approximately 12 of the total area we manage both the real estate and the general services relating to our real estate such as cleaning power and telephone services building services generated about 1 of our total revenues in 2008 

business continuity planning 

we continue to strengthen and upgrade our disaster recovery facilities and capabilities we have dedicated significant resources to improve our continuity planning for example our disaster recovery infrastructure and activities include 

 

  

  

  

 additionally in order to ensure proper coordination during a potential crisis we have established relationships with the local business community law enforcement and local and regional governmental emergency agencies 

strategic relationships 

we continually review our growth strategy and whether it is in the interests of our shareholders to engage in discussions with other parties regarding various strategic acquisitions partnerships divestitures and other arrangements and alliances 

the following is a summary of our key strategic relationships 

bmf to increase liquidity and expand the international market for our customers we have established a partnership with bmf the leading exchange in latin america pursuant to an order routing agreement bmf products can be traded by participants connected to the cme globex electronic trading platform and cme group products can be traded by participants connected to the bmf’s global trading system electronic trading platform we own an equity stake of approximately 5 in bmf and bmf owns an equity stake of approximately 17 in cme group

korea exchange in 2008 we finalized our fiveyear agreement with krx to list the kospi 200 futures contract on cme globex during nighttime trading hours in korea as part of the agreement we will create a telecommunications hub in seoul 

singapore exchange limited in october 2006 we renewed our mutual offset agreement with the singapore exchange for an additional threeyear term with automatic renewals for one year each unless terminated by either party this relationship allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products then transfer them back to the originating exchange 

as a result of the merger with cbot holdings we also list the products of the minneapolis grain exchange and the kansas city board of trade on the cme globex platform and act as their sole distributor of market data 

  

in 2008 we agreed to wind down fxmarketspace our joint venture with reuters group plc that created a centrally cleared global overthecounter foreign exchange marketplace 

marketing programs and advertising 

our marketing programs align our core business objectives and product line goals with positioning messaging and customer targeting strategies designed to increase awareness and use of our products the marketing strategy and tactics include conducting market research to gather customer insight and the implementation of our marketing campaigns which may include online and print advertising direct marketing public relations online marketing and educational programs

our advertising strategies seek to increase awareness and strengthen perceptions of cme group among our institutional and retail customers as well as support an increase in our trading volume we increased our eventdriven marketing to respond to current trends for example in light of the recent financial crisis we created a targeted marketing program to highlight the benefits of our central counterparty clearing model and our financial safeguards package the campaign included print advertising online marketing and educational programs additionally in september 2008 we hosted our firstever global financial leadership conference where participants had an opportunity to interact with some of the world’s leaders in business finance and politics to discuss emerging geopolitical trends and debate critical economic issues we were privileged to have former uk prime minister tony blair and former federal reserve chairman paul volcker as our keynote speakers

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime prior to the passage of the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 cfma futures trading was required to take place on or subject to the rules of a federally designated contract market the costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation and corresponding regulatory requirements created significant barriers to entry for competing exchanges the passage of the cfma and other changing market dynamics have led to increasing competition from a number of different domestic and international sources of varied size business objectives and resources for example the cfma permits secregulated and bank clearing organizations to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that clearing organizations have traditionally cleared the cfma also permits banks and brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to offer and sell foreign exchange futures to retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act cea we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others 

competition in our derivatives business 

we believe competition among exchanges in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs 

over the past few years there have been significant changes in the industry’s landscape as a result of the wave of consolidation and increased competition for example during the past three years in addition to our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings the following consolidations occurred 

 

  

  

 ice also has a pending agreement to acquire the clearing corporation an independent clearing house owned by large derivatives dealers at the end of 2008 there were 52 futures exchanges located in 29 countries including 6 exchanges in the united states additionally there has been an increase in activity among derivative dealers banks and other entities to form competing exchanges in 2007 a consortium of 12 financial institutions formed an exchange electronic liquidity exchange elx to enter the futures market initially listing interest rate products and targeting our us treasuries product line options clearing corporation will provide clearing and delivery service for the exchange and the national futures association will provide regulatory oversight in november 2008 elx filed an application with the cftc for designation as a contract market elx is expected to become operational following receipt of regulatory approval additionally other financial firms have invested in a number of projects in an effort to compete with existing futures exchanges including project rainbow targeting shortterm euribor and sterling interest rate contracts and turquoise these entrants into our industry may increase competitive pressure on us 

because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets we also compete with nyse euronext and other securities and options exchanges dealer markets and alternative trading systems in this product line as well ice in connection with its futures and options on futures contracts based on the russell indexes 

we face competition from the overthecounter market with the trading of contracts similar to those traded or cleared on our exchanges such as swaps forward contracts and other exchange “lookalike” contracts in which parties directly negotiate the terms of their contracts 

we also face a threat of trading volume loss if a significant number of our traditional participants decide to trade futures or similar products among themselves without using any exchange or specific trading system the cfma allows nearly all of our largest customers to transact futures or similar products directly with each other while those transactions raise liquidity and credit concerns they may be attractive based on execution costs flexibility of terms negotiability of margin or collateral deposits or other considerations additionally changes under the cfma permitting the establishment of standalone clearing facilities for futures and overthecounter derivatives transactions will facilitate the mitigation of creditrisk concentrations arising from such transactions 

competition in our transaction processing business 

in addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services including 

 

  

 in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services we compete with other derivatives exchanges that provide clearing services as well as with some of our largest customers who are part of clearing organizations the 

  

clearing corporation is owned by 17 shareholders many of whom represent derivatives marketplace participants and market makers and provides clearing services to third parties as part of our strategic initiatives we have been targeting the overthecounter market including our credit default swap initiative to facilitate the clearing of bilaterally executed trades in december 2008 nyse euronext began clearing credit default swaps in europe following regulatory approval eurex and ice are also undertaking steps to provide these services the clearing corp has entered into a memorandum of understanding with ice in connection with a cleared credit default swaps initiative to be acquired by ice ice operates three regulated clearing houses to provide clearing services to its futures exchange we believe that other exchanges may also undertake to provide clearing services 

we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the cost of the services provided quality and reliability of the services timely delivery of the services reputation and value of linking with existing products markets and distribution 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent potential competitors because as purveyors of market data these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities as technology firms they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks additionally technology and software firms that develop trading systems hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets this may lead to decreased demand for our market data 

regulatory matters 

our operations as a futures exchange have historically been subject to extensive regulation by the cftc the cftc is an independent federal agency with exclusive jurisdiction over the futures market the commission consists of five commissioners appointed to staggered fiveyear terms by the president with the advice and consent of the senate the cftc carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the cea and the cfma the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years which most recently occurred in 2008 

although the cfma significantly reduced our regulatory burdens we remain extensively regulated by the cftc in light of the widespread financial and economic difficulties particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets in light of the transition to a new presidential administration these new proposals as well as previous proposals calling for the merger of the cftc and the sec such as the department of treasury’s blueprint for a modernized financial regulatory structure  we cannot predict what a restructured regulatory framework will look like or what impact it may have on our business the president’s appointee to lead the cftc has recently called for more regulation of futures markets and expressed concern respecting the impact of speculation on price volatility draft bills circulating in congress call for restrictions on speculative trading by means of hard position limits in all contracts and limitations on hedge exemptions that could affect trading volume in addition future regulations could limit speculation in our markets or include a more rulesbased approach rather than our current principlesbased approach under the cftc regulatory regime to the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

the cfma amended the cea in 2000 and created the current principlesbased regulatory approach for regulated markets the cfma codified a threetiered regulatory structure for the trading of derivatives that distinguishes among markets based on the types of contracts traded and the sophistication of the market participants the cfma generally requires that contract markets such as our primary exchanges cme cbot nymex and comex register with the cftc and establish their compliance with seventeen core principles rule compliance and enforcement listing of contracts not readily susceptible to market manipulation trade monitoring system position limits emergency authority information availability daily publication of trading information contract execution procedures for recording and safe storage of trade information financial integrity market participant protections dispute resolution fitness standards conflict of interest management governing board composition recordkeeping and antitrust considerations additionally the cfma generally requires that derivatives clearing organizations like our clearing house register with the cftc and demonstrate their compliance with thirteen core principles financial operational and managerial resources member and product eligibility risk management procedures and tools adequate settlement procedures treatment of customer funds member default procedures rule monitoring and enforcement system clearing system safeguards reporting recordkeeping public information information sharing and antitrust considerations 

under the oversight of the cftc our exchanges are operated as separate selfregulatory organizations generally this requires the promotion of market integrity protection of investors and enforcement of financial requirements sales and trading practices of members cbot nymex and comex outsource responsibility for trade matching regulatory and clearing services to cme our integrated compliance and market surveillance functions allow detailed tracking of all trading and clearing activities our regulatory processes are reviewed and audited by the cftc demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “selfregulation” that has been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program 

  

we have also “notice registered” with the sec as a special purpose national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading security futures products as a result the sec is authorized to review some of our rules relating to these security futures products our members trading those products are subject to registration requirements and duties and obligations to customers under the securities laws that do not pertain to their other futures business 

the proposed presidential budget has from time to time included a proposal to impose a transaction tax on futures traded domestically additionally recently proposed legislation has included a tax on certain transactions in an effort to generate additional funding to support the costs of the recently enacted economic stimulus package while many participants in the futures industry including us oppose these proposals we cannot guarantee that such proposals will not be enacted the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level 

our members 

we operate four separate selfregulatory exchanges cme cbot nymex and comex individuals may be members at any or all of the exchanges to trade our products members are individual traders as well as most of the world’s largest banks hedge funds brokerages and investment houses trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by members in chicago and new york city members can execute trades for their own accounts for clearing firm accounts for the accounts of other members or for the accounts of customers of clearing firms members who trade for their own account including those who lease trading rights qualify for lower transaction fees in recognition of the market liquidity that their trading activity provides these members also benefit from market information advantages that may accrue from their proximity to activity on the trading floors in 2008 our members were responsible for 79 of our total trading volume as of december 31 2008 there were approximately 130 clearing firms membership enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees and to trade directly from the applicable trading floor or electronically through cme globex memberships can be bought sold and leased a customer can apply for and hold a membership at cme cbot nymex or comex – depending on the products that will be traded rights and privileges of membership are exchangespecific a potential member must file with the national futures association nfa either as a floor trader or floor broker if they intend to access one of our trading floors if a customer will use the membership for the purpose of filling orders for other members or customers they must apply to the nfa for a floor broker’s license

our market regulation department is the investigative and enforcement arm of our exchanges with regard to exchange rules members who are found to have violated a rule can be subject to sanctions such as fines trading suspensions andor expulsion from the particular exchange 

our shareholder relations and membership services department maintains an auction market for trading rights at our exchanges

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 

risks relating to our business 

there can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation and stimulus programs will help stabilize the us financial system 

in light of the current financial crisis legislation has been enacted including the the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 and the president’s economic stimulus program and additional legislation has been proposed for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets and improving the overall economy there can be no assurance however as to the actual impact that this legislation will have on the financial markets including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced the government investment in financial services firms could also lead to new regulations and governmental oversight the failure of these regulations to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions or the imposition of additional regulations in the financial services industry could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations access to credit or the trading price of our class a common stock 

current levels of the capital and credit market volatility are unprecedented 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than 12 months during this period the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels in some cases the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access capital including future commercial paper issuances and on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to pay off our fixed and floating rate notes as they become due 

current market developments may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

we generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees declines in trading volumes and market liquidity would adversely affect our business and financial condition during 2008 and 2009 the global financial services industry and securities markets have experienced significant and adverse conditions including significantly increased volatility outflows of customer funds and securities losses resulting from declining asset values defaults on securities and reduced liquidity as a result many financial institutions have required additional capital infusions merged with larger and stronger institutions become bank holding companies that are regulated by the federal reserve bank and in some cases have failed as a result of this instability of the financial markets and the lack of readily available credit commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other of our customers have already decreased and could in the future further decrease their risk exposure and trading volume this circumstance has resulted in a decrease in the trading of our benchmark interest rate products in addition interest rates have stabilized at low levels and we have experienced a decreased demand to hedge interest rate exposure using our markets for example the average daily volume for cme eurodollar options decreased by 27 to 09 million contracts per day in 2008 when compared with 2007 overall average daily volume for our entire interest rate product line was down compared with 2007 if our customers further reduce their level of trading activity for any reason including a reduction in the number of traders reduced trading demand by their customers or a decision to curtail or cease speculative trading our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

current trends in the global financial markets could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price 

stock markets in general and stock prices of participants in the financial services industry in particular including us have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for securities the market price of our class a common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations which may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects and increased volatility could result in a further decline in the market price of our class a common stock factors that could significantly impact the volatility of our stock price include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies these rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our longterm debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations we may still be able to incur more debt intensifying these risks 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 32 billion of total indebtedness additionally on february 9 2009 we issued an additional 750 million of unsecured notes at an interest rate of 575 due 2014 we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay the outstanding commercial paper borrowings backstopped by our 13 billion 364day revolving bridge facility and subsequently terminated the bridge facility after the termination of the bridge facility we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 02 billion 

our indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness may 

 

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations in addition the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness which could increase the risks described above 

  

our investment in bmf subjects us to investment and currency risk 

we own an interest in bmf representing approximately 5 as an exchange bmf’s ability to maintain or expand their trading volume and operate their business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject for the year ended december 31 2008 we took a pretax noncash impairment charge of 275 million on our crossequity investment in bmf due to the decline in bmf’s stock price relative to our original investment in connection with this charge we also reduced stockholder’s equity by 94 million due to unfavorable movements in the brazilian real compared with the us dollar because bmf’s stock is valued in brazilian real to mitigate our financial exposure to the currency risk of the investment we purchased an option to hedge against fluctuations between the us dollar and the brazilian real with lehman brothers special financing inc as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers holdings inc our hedging arrangement was terminated and our currency exposure is no longer mitigated there is no guarantee that our investment in bmf will be profitable under the terms of the transaction we may not sell our shares in bmf until february 2012 

any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets or investments may result in material noncash write downs and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

in connection with our acquisitions including our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings we have recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test looking at historical performance capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise in the fourthquarter 2008 we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 275 million on our crossequity investment in bmf and in connection with this charge we reduced stockholder’s equity by 94 million due to unfavorable movements in the brazilian real compared with the us dollar in the thirdquarter 2008 we recorded an impairment charge of 15 million relating to our swapstream acquisition although we did not experience any other events or circumstances in the year that indicated that the carrying amounts of our other intangible assets and goodwill were impaired we could experience future events that result in impairments the risk of impairment losses may increase to the extent our market capitalization and earnings decline for example during 2008 we experienced a significant decline in our stock price while we believe this decline was principally driven by external circumstances such as the decline in the stock market overall and is not necessarily a reflection of changes in our business model a continued decline in our stock value would be a factor in future assessments whether due to external factors andor a continued decline in our volumes an impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results and could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our existing or future debt agreements 

shareholders who own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchanges account for 20 of the 33 directors on our board these shareholders may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their rights to elect directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

twenty of our 33 directors on our board own or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchange we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets as a result holders of our class a common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the role they serve in our markets their method of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us 

the rights of our members including the board representation rights of the members of our cme exchange to elect six directors and the rights described in the immediately following risk factor could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value 

  

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading privileges require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections additionally our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are also entitled to elect six of the 33 directors on our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent in connection with these rights our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders including actions relating to the operation of our open outcry trading facilities and certain pricing decisions may be limited by the rights of our members 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

our revenue is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets our trading volume is directly affected by us domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including the factors described in the preceding risk factor as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets historically our trading volume has tended to increase during periods of uncertainty due to increased hedging activity and needs to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets however during the current economic volatility we have experienced decreased volume due primarily to our customers decreasing their risk exposure stable low interest rates and the lack of available capital recent events in the economic environment including the subprime lending crisis the downturn in the housing market decreases in consumer spending and the failure of major financial institutions have resulted in an economic recession as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful this trend as well as future economic uncertainty may result in continued decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

generally we have historically experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

  

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure for example we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability will be adversely affected 

the success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our current overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or our current or potential customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading 

  

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar events if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled for example we have experienced technical failures that resulted in a temporary suspension of trading on the cme globex platform we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material impact on our business any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy generally our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

  

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business will not survive 

the derivatives securities and financial services industries are highly competitive we expect that competition will continue to intensify our current and prospective competitors both domestically and around the world are numerous they include securities and securities option exchanges futures exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations market data and information vendors electronic communications networks crossing systems and similar entities consortia of large customers consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities the global derivatives industry has grown increasingly competitive exchanges intermediaries and even end users are consolidating and overthecounter and unregulated entities are constantly evolving additionally in response to growing competition many marketplaces in both europe and the united states have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth in 2007 we completed our merger with cbot holdings nyse group completed its merger with euronext and ice acquired the new york board of trade and the winnipeg commodity exchange in 2008 we completed our acquisition of nymex holdings ice also has a pending agreement to acquire the clearing corp an independent clearing house owned by large derivatives dealers in the last two years there has been a significant increase in activity among derivative dealers banks and other entities to form competing exchanges in 2007 a consortium of 12 financial institutions formed an exchange elx to enter the futures market initially listing interest rate products in november 2008 elx filed an application with the cftc for designation as a contract market elx is expected to become operational following receipt of regulatory approval additionally other financial firms have invested in a number of projects in an effort to compete with existing futures exchanges including project four seasons and turquoise these entrants into our industry may increase competitive pressure on us 

we believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies the number of businesses providing internetrelated financial services is rapidly growing other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may become competitive with us through acquisitions federal law allows institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar products to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can in addition our competitors may 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

a decline in our fees or any loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

future changes in regulations as a result of the recent focus on the regulation of the financial industry in connection with the financial crisis the combination of the sec and the cftc or otherwise may adversely impact our ability to compete 

  

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution alternatives our success also depends on our ability to maintain our trading volume and to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers the majority of the clearing and transaction fees we receive from our clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers we believe that in the event one of our clearing firms discontinues operations the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm however we cannot guarantee you that the discontinuation of any clearing firm would not result in our loss of customers or a loss of trading volume as a result of the consolidation of trading accounts at the acquiring firm which could have an adverse effect on our trading volumes or revenues we also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to lowcost competitors with comparable or superior products services or trade execution facilities if we fail to maintain our trading volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or we lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of trading volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business will be adversely affected furthermore declines in trading volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity which could lead to further loss of trading volume 

any significant decline in the trading volume of our eurodollar or sp 500 futures and options on futures contracts would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we are substantially dependent on trading volume from two product offerings for a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits the clearing and transaction fees revenue attributable to transactions in eurodollar contracts and all our contracts based on the sp 500 including emini products approximated 18 and 24 respectively of our total clearing and transaction fees revenue during the year ended december 31 2008 and 32 and 24 respectively during the year ended december 31 2007 any significant decline in our trading volume in either of these products would negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results 

our eurodollar futures and options on futures reflect libor for a 3month 1 million offshore deposit maturing at some point in the future the accuracy of libor rates has come under scrutiny in recent months due to discrepancies in the borrowing costs in the currency forwards market and the rates reported by the british bankers association as a result of this inconsistency interest rate markets continue to reflect dislocations between eurodollar and overnight rates for example in december 31 2008 the average daily trading volume of our eurodollar options contract was down 27 compared with 2007 the trading volumes of our eurodollar contract may continue to be negatively impacted to the extent that libor continues to be scrutinized 

we also cannot assure you that competitors will not enter the eurodollar market our members may also elect to trade eurodollars in privately negotiated bilateral transactions without the use of our clearing house in either of these events our trading volume revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

our license agreement with sp provides that the sp 500 index futures products will be exclusive through december 31 2016 so long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreement with sp in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments including securities and options based on the sp indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond the jurisdictional reach of us andor our licensors 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties and the soundness of our clearing firms could adversely affect us 

cme our subsidiary owns and operates its own clearing house which acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our futures exchanges or on thirdparty exchanges for which we provide clearing services as a result we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely guarantee transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers as a result of the recent financial crisis many financial institutions have required additional capital infusions merged with larger and stronger institutions become bank holding companies that are regulated by the federal reserve bank and in some cases have failed for example during 2008 the bear stearns companies inc lehman brothers holdings inc and american international group inc all of which were parent companies of clearing firms of our exchange have experienced significant financial writedowns and in some cases failed although none of these cases resulted in a default of a clearing firm additional companies including our clearing firms may encounter economic difficulties as a result of the market turmoil and the tightening of the credit market 

  

as part of our overall growth initiatives we are expanding our clearing services to the overthecounter market in addition to standard futures and options on futures products including through cme clearport and as a result of our proposed joint venture with citadel to clear credit default swaps the process for deriving margins and performance bonds for overthecounter products is different and in part seeks to assess and capture different risks than our historical practices applied to our futures products although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting our financial safeguards for overthecounter products there is no guarantee that our risk management procedures will adequately protect us from the unique risks of these products as we have not historically provided clearing services to this market 

a substantial part of our working capital is at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

the required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market 

to become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit a certain amount of funds with our clearing house as collateral for their trading activity the funds used to satisfy these requirements may be cash or held in a variety of investments such as regulated money market mutual funds us treasury securities and assetbacked securities given the level of market volatility there is no guarantee that these investments will continue to maintain their value to the extent a clearing firm was not in compliance with these requirements it would be required to acquire additional funds decrease its proprietary trading activity andor transfer customer accounts to another clearing firm these actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products 

a key element of our strategy is to provide transaction processing clearing and related services to third parties our failure to identify future opportunities to provide these services will have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business 

providing thirdparty transaction processing clearing and related services is a key element of our strategy pursuant to transactionprocessing agreements we previously provided these services to nymex and to cbot prior to our acquisition of these companies we derived a significant amount of revenue from these services agreements we have entered into other transactionprocessing arrangements with bmf krx and dme we cannot assure you that such arrangements will be as profitable as our previous arrangements with nymex and cbot or that we will enter into additional agreements to provide processing services in the future our failure to capitalize on our existing arrangement and to identify future opportunities may have a negative impact on our ability to generate additional revenues and grow our business 

our market data fees may be reduced or eliminated by decreased demand or the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems if we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we will experience a reduction in revenue 

we sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data totaled 2795 million representing 11 of our total revenues and 1451 million or 8 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively a decrease in overall trading volume may also lead to a decreased demand for our market data from the market data vendors for example we believe that the decrease in the number of devices for cme and cbot market data from approximately 293000 at december 31 2007 to approximately 290000 at december 31 2008 is due primarily to the consolidation of our customers and related headcount reductions as a result of the current financial crisis additionally electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate charges for supplying market data to trading terminals if we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals we will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost market data revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees 

  

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

although the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 significantly reduced our regulatory burdens we remain extensively regulated by the cftc in light of the widespread financial and economic difficulties particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009 there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets in light of the transition to a new presidential administration these new proposals as well as previous proposals calling for the merger of the cftc and the sec such as the department of treasury’s blueprint for a modernized financial regulatory structure  we cannot predict what a restructured regulatory framework will look like or what impact it may have on our business the president’s appointee to lead the cftc has recently called for more regulation of futures markets and expressed concern respecting the impact of speculation on price volatility draft bills circulating in congress call for restrictions on speculative trading by means of hard position limits in all contracts and limitations on hedge exemptions that could affect trading volume in addition future regulations could limit speculation in our markets or include a more rulesbased approach rather than our current principlesbased approach under the cftc regulatory regime to the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

the cftc has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with its rules and regulations we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations we also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the cftc or other agencies if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

our international operations may be subject to similar regulations in specific jurisdictions we are registered in a number of countries outside the united states in some cases our registrations are subject to annual review and such reviews may subject us to additional requirements in the future we may also be required to register or become subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in order to accept business from customers in those jurisdictions 

also from time to time the president’s budget includes a proposal that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions additionally recently proposed legislation has included a tax on certain transactions in an effort to generate additional funding to support the costs of the recently enacted economic stimulus package while those proposals have not been adopted to date except for a limited percontract fee on single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits we cannot assure you that such a tax will not be imposed in the future 

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

some of our largest clearing firms which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with the futures industry association and the us department of treasury have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish or seek to use alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchanges even if they are not successful in their efforts the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets if any of these events occur our revenues and profits would be adversely affected 

  

the imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at or otherwise offset by a fungible position existing at another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business 

in connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the cfma contemplates that once certain market penetration thresholds are crossed clearing houses will establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house if in the future a similar requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 

we as well as many of our customers depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business including revenues derived from our customers’ trading activity 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance 

many of our customers rely on third parties to provide them with frontend systems to access our cme globex platform such as independent software vendors while these third parties are committed to keeping current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality we cannot guarantee that these third parties will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes in the event that these software programs do not interact with our platform seamlessly our customers could be impacted which could lead to a decrease in trading volume 

to the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs we could experience decreased trading volume lower revenues and higher costs 

our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities we could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems 

we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by breaches although we intend to continue to implement security measures these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities 

our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

generally the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which can be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

  

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational financial legal regulatory and strategic risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years for example in 2008 a midlevel trader at societe generale engaged in unauthorized trading which cost societe approximately 7 billion and a trader at mf global one our clearing firms lost approximately 140 million in connection with unauthorized trades misconduct by our employees and agents including employees of gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that engages primarily in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents including our gfx employees also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks while we enjoy governmental immunity for some of our marketrelated activities we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business for example among our current growth initiatives is our goal to enter into the overthecounter market some of our initiatives in this area are subject to additional regulatory approval such as cftc approval of new overthecounter swap products and our pending exemption with the sec relating to cmdx there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful continued growth will require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described in the following risk factor through acquisitions or other strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs both hard and soft associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

our acquisition investment and alliance strategy involves risks if we are unable to effectively manage these risks our business will be materially harmed 

to achieve our strategic objectives in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies businesses or technologies acquisitions entail numerous risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 we may not be able to integrate successfully any operations personnel services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future see “risks relating to the merger with nymex holdings” for additional risks 

we also may seek to expand or enhance some of our operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest and potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we also cannot assure you that any joint venture or alliance that we have entered into including our agreement with citadel as discussed in the following risk factor or may enter into in the future will be successful 

there is no guarantee that our credit default swap joint venture will be successful 

in december 2008 we announced that we had entered into a binding agreement with citadel to launch a joint venture company that would offer a clearing solution and trading platform for the credit default market the joint venture company intends to provide a compression facility linked to clearing for existing credit default swaps known as credit default swaps contracts a trading platform for credit default swaps contracts and various forms of access to our clearing house to clear credit default swaps the current regulatory environment for trading and clearing credit default swaps is uncertain draft bills that would severely curtail the trading of credit default swaps or that might have the effect of regulating such transactions as insurance are being considered several state insurance commissioners have given notice that they may assert jurisdiction while we have completed the review process with the federal reserve board of new york and the cftc and are in the process of seeking certain exemptive relief from the sec we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain and retain all regulatory relief necessary to begin operations we cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably under the conditions imposed to secure regulatory approval or if legislation or regulation adversely affects trading of credit default swaps contracts or reduces the demand for the joint venture’s offerings in addition a number of market participants and exchanges are developing competing platforms government backed initiatives in the european union may favor clearing platforms in the european union we cannot be certain that our platform will be able to compete effectively with these or other alternative platforms 

expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our operations internationally including by directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition as a result of our expanding global operations we may become subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities these may include laws rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business to date we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets we may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we rely primarily on trade secret copyright service mark trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights we have filed several patent applications covering our technology in the united states and certain other jurisdictions notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights we also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law we have copyright registrations for certain of our software user manuals and databases the copyright protection afforded to databases however is fairly limited while the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable the actual data may not be and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function in some cases including a number of our most important products there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and electronic execution services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business for example the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on the world trade center resulted in the closing of nymex’s trading and clearing operations for four business days and rendered its backup data and recovery center inoperable while we have undertaken significant measures to develop business continuity plans and to establish backup sites in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

risks relating to our merger with nymex holdings 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of nymex holdings 

on august 22 2008 we completed our acquisition of nymex holdings the success of the transaction will depend in part on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits from combining the businesses of cme group and nymex holdings we expect cme group to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale market integration and more automation however to realize these anticipated benefits we must successfully combine the businesses of cme group and nymex holdings if we are not able to achieve these objectives the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction in the amounts and times projected for a number of reasons including that the integration may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated 

the failure to integrate successfully the businesses and operations of cme group and nymex holdings in the expected time frame may adversely affect cme group’s future results 

prior to the completion of the transaction cme group and nymex holdings historically operated as independent companies the management of cme group may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of cme group and nymex holdings and their subsidiaries integrating their technologies organizations procedures policies and operations as well as addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel in connection with the acquisition cme group expects to integrate certain operations of cme group and nymex holdings including among other things backoffice operations information technology and regulatory compliance however the combined company will continue to operate a nymex trading floor at its existing location or an alternative location in new york new york as long as both revenue and profitability thresholds are achieved going forward given that historically cme group has not operated a trading floor in a geographic location that is remote from its headquarters in chicago illinois continuing to operate a nymex trading floor in new york new york may present unique challenges the integration of the two companies will be complex and time consuming and require substantial resources and effort the integration process and other disruptions resulting from the transaction may disrupt ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with our members and other market participants employees regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings if we fail to manage the integration of these businesses effectively our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the transaction 

we have incurred costs in connection with our acquisition of nymex holdings and will continue to incur costs in connection with the transaction 

cme group and nymex holdings have incurred significant costs associated with transaction fees professional services and other costs related to the transaction and we will continue to incur additional costs including restructuring costs in connection with the integration of the business specifically through december 31 2008 cme group and nymex holdings have incurred approximately 1045 million for transaction costs related to the transaction although cme group expects that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction mergerrelated and restructuring costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all

the first complaint amended as of october 6 2008 is a purported consolidated class action on behalf of former nymex holdings’ shareholders the shareholder complaint which alleges among other things that the nymex holdings board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in approving the merger agreement by exclusively negotiating a transaction with cme group without regard to the fairness of the transaction to the nymex holdings shareholders failing to take steps to maximize shareholder value capping the minimum price of nymex holdings’ stock failing to properly value nymex holdings making changes to nymex holdings’ change of control severance plan weeks before announcing that it was engaged in discussions with cme group requiring the class a members to execute a waiver and release that allegedly is coercive because it is intended to deprive them of their rights to participate in this lawsuit as well as their rights to past present and future royalty payments under section 311g of the former bylaws of nymex and failing to fully disclose material information related to the merger including financial information and information necessary to prevent statements contained in the preliminary proxy from being misleading the shareholder complaint further alleges that cme group aided and abetted the alleged breach of fiduciary duties

overview 

business structure 

cme group a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for cme cbot nymex and their respective subsidiaries the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme group’s class a common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol “cme” 

our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities 

we are a global exchange with customer access available all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities and alternative investments our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

our major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platforms and our open outcry trading floors these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house 

  

our clearing house clears settles and guarantees every futures and options contract traded through our exchange we also provide clearing services to the overthecounter market through cme clearport and have announced our intention to provide clearing services for credit default swap contracts our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies 

to ensure performance of counterparties we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms and marktomarket their positions at least twice a day we also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products and will set requirements for credit default swaps in the future when we begin servicing that market in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation these assets include security deposits performance bonds and any other available assets such as the proceeds from the sale of pledged class a and class b common stock and associated trading rights of the clearing firm at our exchange that are owned by or assigned to the clearing firm in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of a clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use in order cme’s surplus funds security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit 

industry trends 

economic environment despite the economic turbulence experienced in 2007 and 2008 our markets continue to provide an effective and transparent forum for our customers to manage risk however ongoing instability in the financial markets a decline in assets under management and a decrease in the availability of credit have led to a decline in trading activity in the markets in which we participate our goal is to continue to maintain quality product execution and service in support of our customers while they navigate through the current economic environment 

competitive environment our industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify we face competition in derivatives trading transaction processing services and quotation data services our competitors include futures securities options and securities exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers 

regulatory environment historically our industry has been subject to extensive regulation due to recent financial and economic difficulties there have been many calls to restructure the regulation of the financial markets the change in presidential administrations has made it difficult to predict what a restructured regulatory framework will look like or what impact it will have on our business certain proposals currently under consideration by congress may restrict trading at derivatives exchanges to the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted 

business strategy 

our current strategy seeks to capitalize on opportunities created by the increased awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased price volatility technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services our strategy focuses specifically on leveraging our benchmark products scalable infrastructure clearing and trading technologies as well as the benefits afforded by our integrated clearing house this strategy will enable us to continue to evolve into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that offers trading and clearing solutions across additional products and asset classes our strategy includes coordinated efforts to 

 

  

  

   

primary sources of operating revenue 

clearing and transaction fees a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privatelynegotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for contracts executed through our trading venues because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in trading volume in addition to the industry trends noted earlier our revenues and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty this is because our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from uncertainty however in 2008 we believe the extreme volatility and the decoupling of related markets have reduced customers’ ability to assume and maintain positions which has resulted in a decrease in volume in addition our volume can be seasonal and historically we have experienced higher sequential volume during the first and second quarters followed by decreases in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year however these patterns may be altered by the impact of economic and political events the launch of new products mergers and acquisitions as well as other factors 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence the source of revenues 

 

  

  

  

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we may periodically change fees volume discounts limits on fees and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

as a result of their rate structure total return asset contracts trakrs swapstream products and auctiontraded products are excluded from disclosures of trading volume and average rate per contract in this discussion and analysis clearing and transaction fees on these products are immaterial relative to our other products trakrs are exchangetraded nontraditional futures contracts that trade electronically on the cme globex electronic platform auctiontraded products which included cme economic derivatives were previously traded on the cme auction markets platform through july 2007 

product mix we offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities and alternative investments rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and support introduction of new products to encourage trading volume 

trading venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading platforms as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions any customer guaranteed by a clearing firm is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers executing trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platform in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on all transactions 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

  

quotation data fees we receive revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers our market data services are provided primarily through thirdparty distributors 

subscribers can obtain access to realtime delayed and endofday quotation trade and summary market data for our products users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our quotation data fees revenue is influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data services 

processing services to further diversify the range of services we offer we have entered into clearing and transaction processing agreements with third parties prior to our merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 we collected fees for listing energy and metal futures products on the cme globex platform prior to our merger with cbot holdings in july 2007 we collected fees for clearing services for cbot products our processing services revenues with nymex and cbot ended upon the completion of our mergers with each entity additionally we provided clearing and risk management services for trades executed at fxmarketspace limited fxms our joint venture with reuters group plc reuters beginning in 2007 until fxms terminated operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 we collect fees for processing trades for certain cme clearing firms that execute trades at onechicago llc onechicago our joint venture in single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes 

other sources other sources of revenue include access and communication fees and revenue from various services related to our operations 

 

  

 additionally other revenues includes fees for administrating our interest earnings facility ief program trade order routing and various services to members and clearing firms we offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various ief offerings these clearing firms receive interest income and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit in addition other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by gfx corporation gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that trades primarily in foreign exchange futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products 

  

primary operating expenses 

most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume except licensing and other fee agreements and the majority of our employee bonuses 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plan the bonus funded under the plan would be the “target” level if we achieve the cash earnings target established by the compensation committee of our board of directors cash earnings are defined as net income less capital expenditures and excludes taxeffected amortization of purchased intangibles depreciation and amortization expense taxeffected stockbased compensation expense valuation losses on investments tax adjustments and net interest income expense under the plan if our actual cash earnings equal 80 of the established target for a given year the bonus will be reduced by approximately 50 of the target bonus amount there will be no bonus if our cash earnings are less than 80 of the cash earnings target other than for nonexempt employees who may receive a bonus under our discretionary bonus program if our actual cash earnings equal 120 of the target or higher the bonus is increased by approximately 50 from the targeted bonus amount which is the maximum amount established by the compensation committee if our performance is between the threshold performance level of 80 of the cash earnings target and the maximum performance level of 120 of the cash earnings target the bonus will be calculated based on the level of performance achieved the compensation committee may adjust the cash earnings calculation and the target level of performance for material unplanned revenue expense or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities the cash earnings calculation for bonus purposes excludes items as approved at the discretion of the compensation committee 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to stock options and restricted stock grants stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of options granted fair value is derived using the blackscholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility the riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options granted 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets purchased as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software this expense has increased consistently from year to year due to significant investments in technological equipment and software as a result of our merger with cbot holdings we acquired three commercial buildings we utilize space in these buildings as offices and a trading floor depreciation and amortization on the building and building improvements as well as other furniture fixtures and equipment acquired in the merger has been recorded since the merger closed on july 12 2007 we also acquired property in our recent merger with nymex holdings depreciation and amortization on these building and building improvements hardware and software have been recorded since the merger closed on august 22 2008 

amortization of purchased intangibles this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings as well as other asset and business acquisitions intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships licensing agreements and leaserelated intangible assets 

other expenses we incur additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 nonoperating income and expense 

income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered nonoperating these activities include investments in debt and equity securities for both shortterm and longterm strategic purposes and our securities lending program as well as financing activities 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to valuation of financial instruments goodwill and intangible assets derivative investments revenue recognition income taxes internal use software costs and stockbased compensation 

valuation of financial instruments in january 2008 we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities by defining fair value and establishing a framework for measuring fair value sfas no 157 applies to all financial instruments that are measured and reported on a fair value basis 

sfas no 157 defines “fair value” as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date or an exit price the standard establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 

we have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into a threelevel classification in accordance with sfas no 157 the hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows 

 

  

  

   

to corroborate the reasonableness of our level 3 fair value models we have obtained valuations for level 3 assets and liabilities from independent third parties where available for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities see note 24 in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the provisions of sfas no 142 require that a twostep impairment test be performed on goodwill in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions valuation techniques we use to measure fair value include the market approach and the income approach the market approach encompasses comparable data sets within our peer group and the income approach includes discounted cash flow measurements using a discount rate based on our market capitalization additionally we have used a discounted cash flow to convert future amounts to present value our valuation techniques could yield variable results based on changes in assumptions such as the discount rate and longterm growth rate and forecasted revenue and expense 

indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicated by a change in circumstances pursuant to sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value the estimate of the fair value of all intangible assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows in estimating the fair value management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows future revenues future earnings and other factors such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 

derivative investments we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended sfas no 133 also requires that changes in our derivatives’ fair values be recognized in earnings unless the instruments are accounted for as hedges for a derivative designated as a fair value hedge any gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change to the extent the hedge is effective together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged we record the effective portions of our derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets when the hedged item affects earnings the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss is transferred to the same line in the consolidated statements of income as the hedged item any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately any realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of income consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged 

revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies comply with staff accounting bulletin no 101 on revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customer’s exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests occasionally market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment when these circumstances occur revenue is recognized as services are provided 

income taxes calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years as determined in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” and financial interpretation fin no 48 “accounting for 

  

uncertain tax positions” as required our deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if all assets will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes to tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax such as municipal interest income and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as certain foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” costs capitalized are for application development or implementation as required by sop 981 for software projects that will result in significant new functionality and that are generally expected to cost in excess of 05 million the amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible softwarerelated activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria of sop 981 and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project completed internal use software projects as well as workinprogress projects are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets once completed the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software generally three years costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from year to year based on our technologyrelated business requirements 

stockbased compensation we expense stock options using the fair value method under the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” we have elected the accelerated method for recognizing the expense related to stock grants due to this election and the vesting provisions of our stock grants a greater percentage of the total expense is recognized in the first and second years of the vesting period than would be recorded if we used the straightline method we include an estimate of expected forfeitures of stock grants in our expense recognition calculations 

recent accounting pronouncements 

sfas no 141r “business combinations” was issued in december 2007 to replace sfas no 141 “business combinations” sfas no 141r requires that an acquirer recognize the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date this new statement also changes the requirements for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies restructuring liabilities and acquisition costs under the new requirements acquisitionrelated costs will be expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred instead of being capitalized as part of the purchase price the provisions of this statement are applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 we are currently assessing the impact of this standard’s adoption on our financial statements 

in march 2008 sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities” was issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb the statement requires entities to enhance disclosures about its derivative and hedging activities in order to improve the transparency of financial reporting entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why they use derivative instruments how derivative instruments are accounted for under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect their financial position financial performance and cash flows this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 we will make the required disclosures upon adoption 

  

in june 2008 fasb issued fasb staff position fsp emerging issue task force no 036 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” fsp no 036 clarifies the treatment of unvested equity awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents in calculating earnings per share under sfas no 128 “earnings per share” this position is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those years we are currently assessing the impact of this standard’s future adoption on our consolidated financial reporting 

results of operations 

financial highlights 

the comparability of our operating results for 2006 2007 and 2008 is significantly impacted by our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings in july 2007 and august 2008 respectively in the discussion and analysis that follows we have quantified the incremental revenue or expense resulting from these transactions wherever such amounts were material and identifiable while identified amounts may provide indications of general trends the analysis cannot completely address the effects attributable to integration efforts 

the following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the periods presented

operating revenues 

 

 clearing and transaction fees from 2006 through 2008 revenues have increased primarily as a result of incremental trading volume generated from our mergers with cbot and nymex organic volume growth also contributed to an increase in revenue from 2006 to 2007 the average rate per contract increased from 2007 to 2008 while declining from 2006 to 2007 

trading volume 

the following table summarizes average daily trading volume for comparative purposes cme cbot and nymex products have been presented separately for 2007 cbot volume information average daily volumes have been calculated for the period from july 13 through december 31 2007 the nymex trading volume has been calculated for the period august 23 through december 31 2008 all amounts exclude trakrs swapstream and auctiontraded products 

 

 nm not meaningful 

  

the addition of the cbot and nymex product lines in 2007 and 2008 respectively contributed to the overall trading volume increase in 2007 and 2008 in addition there was also a significant surge in overall market volatility in the second half of 2007 through 2008 which contributed to the overall increase in volume specifically within equity products we believe the increase in market volatility is largely due to concerns surrounding the subprime debt market which evolved into a credit crisis in 2008 in the discussion of volume that follows nymex volume information for the periods prior to august 23 2008 is provided for comparative purposes only and does not correspond to revenue recognized by cme group prior to that date cbot volume information for periods prior to july 13 2007 is also provided for comparative purposes only 

interest rate products 

in 2008 the overall decline in interest rate volume was due largely to the global credit crisis we believe the credit crisis has led to firm deleveraging industry consolidation increased risk aversion reduced debt issuance and has distorted historical relationships between fixed income and interest rate derivative securities 

the decrease in eurodollar options is the primary driver for the overall decrease in cme interest rate volume eurodollar options which are primarily traded through open outcry decreased by 27 to an average of 09 million contracts per day in 2008 when compared with 2007 average daily volume for eurodollar futures contracts decreased by 4 to 24 million contracts in 2008 when compared with 2007 we believe extreme volatility and the decoupling of related markets have reduced certain customers’ ability to assume and maintain positions which has resulted in a decrease in volume the increase in market volatility is believed to have been generated from uncertainty regarding interest rate expectations as a result of the credit crisis eurodollar option volume levels are more sensitive to volatility compared with eurodollar futures contracts 

average daily volume for the 10year us treasury note futures and options was 12 million during 2008 and 17 million during the period july 13 through december 31 2007 volume for the 5year us treasury note futures and options averaged 07 million contracts per day during 2008 and 08 million contracts per day for the period july 13 through december 31 2007 we believe the credit crisis contributed to some fixed income market participants shifting from longterm debt to shortterm debt which led to a decrease in volume for products on the long end of the yield curve relative to products on the short end of the yield curve 

the increase in interest rate trading volume in 2007 when compared with 2006 is due primarily to the addition of the cbot interest rate products subsequent to the merger overall trading volume growth for interest rate products also resulted from uncertainty regarding inflation and market interest rates as well as concerns about the subprime debt market eurodollar futures traded electronically increased to an average of 22 million contracts per day in 2007 an increase of 30 when compared with 2006 additionally volume for eurodollar options traded via open outcry increased 14 to an average of 11 million contracts per day in 2007 

equity products 

there has been significant volatility in the equity markets in the second half of 2007 through 2008 which we believe is attributable to concerns regarding the subprime debt market and inflation in late 2007 that evolved into a recession which resulted in escalating volatility throughout the period average volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index increased by 86 in 2008 when compared with 2007 average volatility increased by 77 in the last six months of 2007 when compared with the same period in 2006 we believe this increase in volatility is the primary reason for the growth in our equity trading volume during 2008 and 2007 

average daily volume for our emini equity products increased by 37 to 33 million contracts in 2008 when compared with 2007 this increase includes growth in emini sp 500 futures and options contracts which grew by 52 to an average of 26 million contracts per day when compared with 2007 trading volume for emini equity products increased by 50 to 24 million contracts per day in 2007 compared with 2006 with emini sp 500 futures and options contracts increasing 60 to 17 million contracts 

our license to list russellbased contracts terminated in september 2008 when the last contract expired average daily volume for the russellbased contracts was 261000 252000 and 173000 contracts per day for january 1 through september 22 2008 and for the years 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

foreign exchange 

trading volume for foreign exchange products increased in 2008 when compared with 2007 due largely to increased volatility of the us dollar relative to other major currencies particularly the euro and japanese yen the average daily volume for euro products increased by 26 to 223000 contracts the japanese yen products increased 6 to an average of 133000 contracts per day during 2008 in 2008 electronicallytraded foreign exchange volume was 95 of total foreign exchange volume compared with 92 in 2007 and 88 in 2006 

the increase in trading of foreign exchange products in 2007 when compared with 2006 was fueled in part by the decline of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen the euro and the british pound we believe that market reaction to events in the fixed income market also contributed to volume growth during 2007 

commodity and alternative investment products 

the increase in overall commodities trading volume in 2008 when compared with 2007 is primarily attributable to the addition of the nymex products to our existing product lines nymex products consist mainly of energy futures and options as well as futures and options on precious and base metals average daily trading volume for nymex products increased 19 to 17 million contracts per day during 2008 when compared with 2007 nymex contracts traded electronically increased 37 to an average of 10 million contracts per day during 2008 when compared with 2007 trading volume for overthecounter products increased by 39 to an average of 468000 contracts per day in 2008 

in addition the increase in cbot corn and soybean products also contributed to an increase in overall commodities trading volume in 2008 during 2008 volume for basic corn products increased by 17 to an average of 320000 contracts per day average daily volume for basic soybean products grew by 16 to 183000 contracts per day during 2008 we believe that the increases in volume are due primarily to changes in global supply and demand resulting in increased volatility as well as increased use of commodities as an asset class 

on september 5 2008 cme group completed the sale of cbot metals trading products including open interest average volume for these metals products was 23000 contracts per day in 2008 through the date of the sale 

from 2006 to 2007 trading volume grew primarily due to the volume generated subsequent to the merger by the addition of cbot commodities products 

average rate per contract 

in 2008 the increase in the average rate per contract also contributed to an increase in overall revenue when compared with 2007 in 2007 the average rate per contract decreased when compared with 2006 which offset the overall increase in volume for 2007 cbot total volume and fees have been included for the period from july 13 through december 31 2007 the nymex total volume and fees have been included for the period august 23 through december 31 2008 all amounts in the following table exclude trakrs swapstream and auctiontraded products 

 

 during 2008 the addition of the nymex products to our existing product lines was the primary contributor to an increase in the overall rate per contract as the nymex average rate per contract was 1641 for the period august 23 through december 31 2008 the increase in average rate per contract when compared with 2007 was also attributable to a lower portion of cme interest rate products as a percentage of total volume compared with cme equity products which have a higher rate per contract as a percentage of total volume cme equity products trading volume increased by 9 in 2008 while cme interest rate products trading volume decreased by 10 when compared with 2007 in addition the overall increase in the average rate per contract was partially attributable the full year impact in 2008 of the average rate per contract for the cbot products the average rate per contract for the cbot products in 2008 was 0712 

  

the increase in average rate per contract during 2008 was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate per contract for the emini sp futures and options because incremental volume exceeded the cme globex fee cap 

the average rate per contract decreased in 2007 when compared with 2006 due primarily to growth in member trading member trading volume increased faster than nonmember trading in 2007 we believe that higher volumes by automated trading systems which typically receive member rates contributed to this increase in member trading in addition the average rate per contract of the emini sp futures and options contracts decreased due to incremental volume exceeding the cme globex surcharge cap resulting in a decrease in the overall average rate per contract 

the decrease in average rate per contract in 2007 was partially offset by the addition of cbot products to our existing product lines the average rate per contract for cbot products was 0657 for the period july 13 through december 31 2007 the increase in average rate per contract is attributable primarily to an increase in commodities volume which has a higher average rate per contract during the fourth quarter of 2007 additionally cme interest rate product volume decreased as a percentage of total volume compared with an increase in emini equity products which have a higher rate per contract as a percentage of total volume emini equity volume increased by 5 in 2007 when compared with 2006 while interest rate product volume decreased by 4 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers as of december 31 2008 we have approximately 130 clearing firms two firms represented 12 and 10 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2008 should a clearing firm discontinue operations we believe the customer portion of the firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe a concentration would expose us to significant risk from the loss of revenue earned from a particular firm 

quotation data fees the growth in revenue from 2006 through 2008 is attributable primarily to increasing device screen counts as well as annual increases in the monthly fee for basic services the increase in basic device counts is largely due to the addition of cbot’s existing customers to cme’s customer base subsequent to the merger in july 2007 in addition the revenue generated from the nymex services subsequent to the merger also contributed to an increase in revenues in 2008 

revenue from cma services includes fees for data services provided to cma customers from march 24 through december 31 2008 nymex services includes revenue generated from basic and other services provided to nymex’s existing customers from august 23 through december 31 2008 

we currently have no plans to increase the monthly fee for any of our basic services in 2009 

 

 data feed surcharges are charges billed primarily to quote vendors for access to various data feeds in 2008 we also recognized additional revenue of 44 million related to audits of customerreported device counts which represents revenue that would have otherwise been recognized in prior periods 

  

the two largest resellers of our market data generated approximately 56 67 and 55 of our quotation data fees in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively however we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal despite this concentration in the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendor’s customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller additionally several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from the two largest quote vendors report usage and remit payment for exchange market data fees directly to us 

processing services the decrease in revenues in 2008 when compared with 2007 is largely attributable to the termination of our prior service agreements with cbot holdings and nymex holdings as a result of the mergers our clearing agreement with cbot holdings which was terminated on july 12 2007 resulted in a decrease of 482 million in 2008 fees generated from our trade matching agreement with nymex holdings which was terminated on august 22 2008 decreased by 107 million when compared with 2007 additionally the operations of fxms terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008 consequently we recognized incremental revenues of 64 million for upfront fees paid by fxms for clearing and trade matching services which would have been provided by cme through january 2012 

revenues grew in 2007 when compared with 2006 due primarily to an increase in nymex volume revenues generated from trade matching services provided to nymex which began at the end of the second quarter of 2006 increased by 421 million in 2007 when compared with 2006 the total volume of nymex products available on the cme globex platform increased to 1915 million in 2007 from 356 million contracts in 2006 the increase in 2007 was partially offset by a decrease in revenue resulting from the elimination of fees generated by the clearing agreement with cbot the decrease in processing services revenue resulting from this termination was 276 million in 2007 when compared with 2006 

access and communication fees the revenue growth from 2006 through 2008 is primarily attributable to the telecommunication services provided to cbot customers subsequent to the merger with cbot holdings in july 2007 in addition the ongoing upgrade of customer bandwidth connections and expansion of our colocation program also contributed to growth in revenue yearoveryear throughout the period incremental revenue resulting from our merger with nymex holdings was not material in 2008 

other revenues the increase in revenues over the periods presented is due largely to the rental income and related revenues generated from the building operations acquired as a result our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings rental income and associated revenues from cbot holdings’ building operations totaled 252 million in 2008 and 112 million in 2007 nymex holdings’ operations contributed incremental revenues of 44 million for the period august 23 through december 31 2008 the other revenues for the nymex holdings’ building operations primarily include rental income 

the interest earning facility programs generated incremental revenues of 34 million in 2008 when compared with 2007 due to an increase in the average funds invested by our clearing firm members in these programs additionally gfx trading gains increased by 15 million and 26 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively when compared with the prior years 

  

operating expenses 

 

 nm not meaningful 

compensation and benefits annual increases in compensation and benefits expense consisted primarily of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

communications expense increased from 2006 through 2008 due primarily to the costs incurred to support metals products on ecbot and to provide ongoing customer connectivity continued growth in existing customer and data center connections and bandwidth upgrades also contributed to an increase in expense in 2007 when compared with 2006 the addition of the nymex trading operations in august 2008 did not have a material impact on expense in 2008 we expect a reduction in communication expense relative to current levels due to improved wide area network efficiencies and the sale of the cbot metals trading products 

technology support services the increase in expense in 2008 is due to increases in software and hardware maintenance contracts including the maintenance and support of the ecbot electronic trading platform and increases in software in 2007 there was an increase of approximately 151 million due primarily to the integration and support of the ecbot electronic trading platform additional investments in technology including an upgrade to our network and mainframe system in 2006 led to increased maintenance costs as part of a planned system expansion to increase capacity for peak volumes of transactions processed electronically 

professional fees and outside services the increases in technologyrelated and other professional fees net of amounts capitalized for internally developed software from 2006 through 2008 were due primarily to consulting services used to supplement our merger integration efforts as well as noncapitalizable software development costs and expenses incurred to support our strategic initiatives temporary staffing and consulting services also contributed to the increase in 2008 due to infrastructure development production support and various strategic initiatives 

legal fees increased in 2008 due to class action lawsuits filed as a result of the nymex holdings merger the increase in legal fees in 2007 was due to litigation costs related to the lampers and cboe proceedings resulting from our merger with cbot holdings as well as the ongoing antitrust suit filed by eurex us 

amortization of purchased intangibles intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm relationships market data customer relationships the dow jones licensing agreement and leaserelated intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles in 2006 relates to intangible assets obtained as a result of our business acquisition of swapstream and our acquisition of assets from liquidity direct technology llc 

the increase in expense from 2006 through 2008 is due primarily to intangible assets obtained in our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings completed in july 2007 and august 2008 respectively 

depreciation and amortization the increase is due primarily to additional assets obtained in our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings we have shortened the useful lives of various technologyrelated and trading floor assets due to consolidation of electronic trading systems and trading floor operations of cbot in addition we accelerated depreciation on certain nymex technologyrelated assets through december 2009 

property additions are summarized below technologyrelated assets include purchases of computers and related equipment software the cost of developing internal use software and the buildout of our data centers total property additions increased in 2008 due to spending for the development of our new data center and the development of our chicago office space the decrease in technologyrelated assets as a percentage of total property additions is attributable to landlord tenant improvement allowances at buildings acquired in our cbot holdings and nymex holdings mergers 

 

   

occupancy and building operations in 2008 we acquired additional commercial real estate as part of our merger with nymex holdings utilities maintenance and real estate tax expense for these properties contributed to the increased expense in 2007 rent expense also increased in 2008 due to additional office space in london hong kong india japan and singapore we also purchased a remote data center facility that resulted in an increased occupancy expense in 2008 

in august 2007 we renegotiated the leases for office space and former trading floor facilities at our headquarters under the terms of our new lease which extends our occupancy through 2022 we will be reducing our rented space in 2009 

licensing and other fee agreements in 2008 higher average daily trading volume for certain licensed products and additional royalty fees and broker rebates on nymex products contributed to additional expense when compared with 2007 in addition licensing fees on emini sp and on emini nasdaq100 products contributed to the increase in 2008 we renewed our exclusive product licensing agreement with dow jones in september 2007 the new agreement is effective from january 2008 through december 2014 and included an upfront payment as well as minimum annual payments the upfront payment which was negotiated in exchange for a reduced rate per contract is being recognized in equal amounts each month over the term of the agreement 

higher trading volume for licensed products particularly emini sp products resulted in an increase in expense in 2007 also contributing to the increase were licensing and market maker fees related to cbot products these increases were partially offset by a reduction in costs incurred under a fee sharing agreement with singapore exchange limited sgx 

restructuring this expense consists primarily of severance to transitional cbot and nymex employees severance to cme employees retention bonuses and associated payroll taxes as well as outplacement costs and postemployment healthcare subsidies the restructuring plan related to the cbot holdings merger which was initiated in august 2007 was substantially complete by july 2008 

other expenses other expenses increased in 2008 when compared with 2007 due primarily to an 119 million goodwill impairment charge related to our swapstream operations 63 million of incremental marketing and advertising activities due to the cbot holdings and nymex holdings mergers 37 million of inprocess research and development costs related to our purchase of cma and 35 million in travel costs related to ongoing strategic initiatives the increase in 2008 also reflects 38 million of unfavorable brazilian currency fluctuations and a 23 million loss on the sale of cbot metals trading products 

the increase in 2007 is attributable primarily to 80 million of marketing advertising and public relations costs incurred as part of our global band campaign and efforts to redesign and expand our customer education programs also contributing to the increase was 63 million of settlement costs related to the lampers class action lawsuit 

a higher level of general and administrative expenses resulting from our mergers also contributed to the increases in 2008 and 2007 expense 

nonoperating income expense 

 

 nm not meaningful 

  

investment income during 2008 investment income decreased due largely to the decline in market interest rates resulting from rate reductions by the federal open market committee during the year the increase in investment income in 2007 when compared with 2006 was attributable primarily to the investment of additional cash generated from operations during the year as well as rising shortterm interest rates in late 2007 interest rates began to decline resulting in a decline in the investment income growth rate we had experienced earlier in the year 

annualized average rates of return and average investment balances indicated in the table below include shortterm investments classified as cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and the portion of the clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits that we chose to invest 

 

 the analysis presented in the table above does not include the income loss on insurance contracts and marketable securities that are related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans of 82 million 22 million and 19 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively and 133 million of dividend income on our investment in bmf stock for 2008 

impairment of longterm investment all equity securities are assessed for otherthantemporary impairment on a quarterly basis taking into consideration the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss as of december 31 2008 we determined that our investment in bmf was impaired due to an extended decline in the market price of bmf stock as a result we recognized an impairment loss of 2745 million in february 2008 we exchanged 12 million shares of our class a common stock to obtain our 1011 million shares investment in bmf we are restricted from selling our bmf shares until february 2012 

gains losses on derivative investments the net loss on derivative contracts is due primarily to the change in fair value of the put option contract purchased to hedge our risk of changes in the fair value of bmf stock resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the brazilian real the change in fair value resulted in a loss of 59 million in 2008 lehman brothers special financing inc lbsf was the sole counterparty to this option contract on september 15 2008 lehman brothers holdings inc lehman filed for protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code the bankruptcy filing of lehman was an event of default that gave us the right to immediately terminate the put option agreement with lbsf under the terms of our agreement the fair value of the put option was not required to be fully collateralized upon termination we recognized a loss of 20 million due to the shortfall in collateralization 

in addition during 2008 we entered into three interest rate swaps to hedge our risk of changes in interest payments on floating rate debt due to changes in the underlying benchmark rate these hedges are expected to be highly effective to the extent that there is ineffectiveness we record a gain or loss on derivative investments during the period incurred the impact of recognizing ineffectiveness was not material in 2008 

the financial statement impact of derivative financial instrument arrangements in effect during 2006 and 2007 was immaterial 

securities lending income and expense our securities lending program was curtailed and at times suspended during 2008 due to high volatility in the credit markets and extreme demand for us treasury securities this resulted in a decline in the average daily balance of funds invested in 2008 when compared with 2007 the increase in spread between the average rate earned and the average rate paid during 2008 was due to the combination of an increase in demand for us treasury securities which affects the rate paid and a lag effect from changing interest rates on the reinvested cash in money market funds which affects the rate earned the decrease in 2008 overall revenue and expense is attributable to the decline in average funds invested as well as the federal open market committee’s interest rate reductions 

  

despite a temporary suspension of the securities lending program in 2007 we were able to expand lending relationships to include additional banks resulting in an increase in the average daily balance of funds invested when compared with 2006 the spread between the average rate earned and the average rate paid increased during 2007 due to the combined effect of changes in the federal discount rate which correlates closely with the interest expense and an increase in market demand for the securities we had available to lend through this program 

 

 the analysis presented in the table above does not reflect 

 

  

 interest and other borrowing costs in 2008 interest and other borrowing costs increased due largely to higher average debt levels outstanding as a result of debt issued in august 2008 in conjunction with the nymex holdings merger these borrowings consisted of commercial paper and longertermed fixed and floating rate notes weighted average borrowings outstanding during 2008 were 13 billion the weighted average rate and weighted average effective yield including debt issuance costs and accretion of debt discount was 366 and 428 respectively in 2008 the weighted average balance of commercial paper outstanding in 2007 was 642 million the weighted average rate and weighted average effective yield was 495 and 498 for 2007 respectively we did not have any debt outstanding during 2006 

guarantee of exercise right privileges under the terms of our merger with cbot holdings holders that did not elect to sell their erps to us were entitled to a minimum guaranteed payment of up to 250000 upon resolution of the lawsuit between cbot and cboe in december 2008 a settlement hearing for the erp litigation was held however a final ruling has not been made our liability under the guarantee which is recorded at fair value in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets was estimated as 12 million and 140 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in the fair value was due to a reassessment of the possible outcomes of the litigation we will continue to adjust the fair value of the guarantee on a quarterly basis until the lawsuit is resolved 

equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries the 2008 increase in this account was due primarily to our decision to terminate our investment in fxms our joint venture with reuters which was established in the second half of 2006 as a result we wrote off 159 million the full amount of our existing investment in fxms and our portion of the remaining capital needed to wind down operations since forming the venture we have recorded 303 million excluding the amount written off for our share of losses from operations related to this investment 

other nonoperating expense this expense is attributable primarily to transfer and other transaction fees related to our acquisition of an equity stake in bmf in the first quarter of 2008 

income tax provision 

the effective tax rate increased to 427 in 2008 compared with 399 in 2007 and 394 in 2006 the increase was driven primarily by an increase in our state and local tax rate due to our merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 including a charge of 483 million to record the impact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing net deferred tax liabilities the increase in our net deferred tax liabilities was partially offset by a first quarter benefit from 

  

an illinois tax law change that resulted in a 386 million reduction in net deferred tax liabilities in addition our 2008 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by an increase in our accrual for uncertain tax positions related to state and local tax exposures a reduced benefit as compared with the prior year related to our taxadvantaged securities and the nondeductibility of goodwill and intangible asset impairment for swapstream that was recorded in the third quarter of 2008 the increase in the effective tax rate from 2006 to 2007 was due primarily to the inability to recognize the benefit of net operating losses generated by swapstream’s operations 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

until we began our commercial paper program in mid2007 we historically met our funding requirements through operations while our cost structure is primarily fixed in the short term our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on trading volume levels we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs capital expenditures and other commitments however it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by borrowing money from financial institutions 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancelable purchase obligations as well as commitments reflected as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 these commitments are as follows in thousands 

 

  

 future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through investment in increased system capacity and performance and through technological initiatives on our electronic trading platforms each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices remote data centers telecommunications capabilities and other operating equipment we expect 2009 capital expenditures to total between 2000 million and 2250 million excluding leasehold improvements for our office space that will be funded with landlord allowances anticipated expenditures for 2009 include approximately 750 million of data center buildout costs related primarily to our new data center however we continue to monitor capital expenditures and may revise our expected capital expenditures throughout 2009 if necessary 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders the decision to pay a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant in 2008 our dividend target remained at approximately 30 of the prior year’s cash earnings for 2009 our annual dividend target will remain at approximately 30 of 2008 cash earnings on february 4 2009 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 115 per share payable on march 25 2009 to shareholders of record on march 10 2009 assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the march 2009 dividend payment will total approximately 764 million 

sources and uses of cash 

net cash provided by operating activities was 12 billion in 2008 compared with 8144 million in 2007 net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to increased profitability excluding impairment charges for 2008 net cash provided by operating activities was 4817 million higher than net income this increase consisted primarily of an impairment charge of 2745 million on our investment in bmf 1373 million of depreciation and amortization 987 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and an 813 million decrease in accounts receivable accounts 

  

receivable in any period result primarily from the clearing and transaction fees billed in the last month of the reporting period these were partially offset by a 1151 million increase in deferred tax liabilities and a 1011 million decrease in current liabilities the increase in deferred tax liabilities was due primarily to the impact of the impairment of our investment in bmf on our us tax provision the increase in other current liabilities is due primarily to an increase in interest payable related to an increase in debt levels as well an increase in accrued restructuring related to our merger with nymex holdings 

cash used in investing activities was 37 billion in 2008 compared with 786 million in 2007 the increase in cash used in 2008 when compared with 2007 is due primarily to cash paid to shareholders in our merger with nymex holdings of 28 billion net of cash received and a payment of 6120 million for the purchase of certain nymex membership rights in conjunction with the merger 

cash provided by financing activities was 20 billion in 2008 compared with cash used in financing activities of 8599 million in 2007 the increase in cash provided relative to the prior year was due primarily to proceeds from debt issuances net of maturities of 16 billion and an increase in proceeds from our commercial paper program net of maturities of 12 billion the increase in debt issuance during 2008 was primarily attributable to the merger with nymex holdings 

debt instruments 

on august 12 2008 cme group completed a public debt offering of 13 billion including 2500 million of floating rate notes due in 2009 3000 million of floating rate notes due in 2010 and 7500 million 540 fixed rate notes due in 2013 the floating rate notes due in 2009 and 2010 accrue interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 020 and libor plus 065 respectively the proceeds from the debt issuance were used to finance the merger with nymex holdings 

on august 22 2008 we entered into a 14 billion senior credit facility with various financial institutions which includes a term loan of 4205 million and a revolving credit facility of 9955 million we may at our option so long as we are not in default under the senior credit facility increase the facility from time to time by an aggregate amount of up to 11 billion to a total of 21 billion of revolving loans with only the consent of the agent and the lenders providing the additional funds proceeds from the senior credit facility were used to pay fees and expenses and finance the merger with nymex holdings to pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing of existing debt of nymex holdings to finance dividends and stock repurchases as well as to support issuances of commercial paper 

in addition we entered into a 13 billion 364day revolving bridge facility with various financial institutions on august 22 2008 the proceeds from the loan were used to finance costs associated with the merger this facility can also serve as a backup facility for commercial paper and can be used to finance dividends and stock repurchases we borrowed 1870 million against the revolving loan facility during the year and repaid the outstanding debt by the end of the year 

on february 10 2009 we completed a public debt offering of 7500 million of 575 fixed rate notes due in 2014 the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay any outstanding commercial paper borrowings that were backstopped by the 364day revolving bridge facility the remaining net proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes we terminated the bridge facility on february 10 2009 

after the termination of the bridge facility we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 02 billion 

we maintain a 364day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house the line of credit provides for borrowings of up to 6000 million this line of credit is collateralized by clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as security deposit funds in the iefs and any performance bond deposits of a clearing firm that has defaulted on its obligation the line of credit can only be drawn on to the extent it is collateralized at december 31 2008 security deposit collateral available was 21 billion we have the option to request an increase in the line from 6000 million to 10 billion with the participating banks’ approval 

as of december 31 2008 we maintained an aa longterm credit rating and an a1 shortterm credit rating with standard  poor’s we maintained an aa3 longterm credit rating and a p1 shortterm credit rating with moody’s investor service moody’s the outlook for our ratings is considered stable by standard  poor’s and moody’s we expect to maintain an investment grade rating given our ability to pay down debt levels and refinance existing debt facilities if necessary if our ratings are downgraded due to a change in control which results in a downgrade below investment grade we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed and floating rate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition our senior credit facility and revolving line of credit also require that we maintain a specified minimum net worth as of december 31 2008 we are in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities 

  

to satisfy our performance bond obligation with sgx we pledge cmeowned us treasury securities in lieu of or in combination with irrevocable letters of credit at december 31 2008 the letters of credit totaled 330 million in addition we had pledged securities with a fair value of 2838 million at december 31 2008 

cme also guarantees a 50 million standby letter of credit for gfx the beneficiary of the letter of credit is the clearing firm that is used by gfx to execute and maintain its futures position the letter of credit would be utilized in the event gfx defaults in meeting performance bond requirements to its clearing firm 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2008 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the securities and exchange commission 

liquidity and cash management 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 2979 million at december 31 2008 and 8453 million at december 31 2007 the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy and alternative investment choices in june 2008 we approved a repurchase of up to 11 billion of cme group class a common stock effective january 2009 we have temporarily suspended this program to devote our excess free cash flow to debt reduction 

our practice is to have our pension plan 100 funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction based on our actuarial projections we estimate that a 50 million contribution in 2009 will allow us to meet our funding goal however the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2009 

net current deferred tax assets of 955 million and 184 million are included in other current assets at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively net current deferred tax assets result primarily from unrealized losses stockbased compensation and accrued expenses 

net longterm deferred tax liabilities were 77 billion and 38 billion at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively net deferred tax liabilities are primarily the result of purchase accounting for intangible assets in our mergers with cbot holdings and nymex holdings 

we have a longterm deferred tax asset included within our domestic longterm deferred tax liability of 1449 million for an unrealized capital loss incurred in brazil related to our investment in bmf as of december 31 2008 we do not believe that we currently meet the morelikelythannot threshold that would allow us to fully realize the value of the unrealized capital loss as a result a partial valuation allowance of 247 million has been provided for the amount of the unrealized capital loss that exceeds potential capital gains that could be used to offset the capital loss in future periods we also have a longterm deferred tax asset related to brazilian taxes of 1281 million for a net operating loss and an unrealized capital loss incurred in brazil related to our investment in bmf a full valuation allowance of 1281 million has been provided because we do not believe that we currently meet the morelikelythannot threshold that would allow us to realize the value of the net operating loss or the unrealized capital loss in brazil in the future 

net longterm deferred tax assets also include a 155 million deferred tax asset for acquired and accumulated net operating losses related to swapstream since swapstream has not yet developed a pattern of operating income our assessment at december 31 2008 is that we do not believe that we currently meet the morelikelythannot threshold that would allow us to realize the value of acquired and accumulated foreign net operating losses in the future as a result the 155 million deferred tax benefit arising from these net operating losses has been fully reserved 

each clearing firm is required to deposit and maintain a specified performance bond balance which is determined by parameters established by the risk management department of the clearing house and may fluctuate over time performance bond requirements can be satisfied with a variety of approved investments and cash cash performance bonds and security deposits are included in our consolidated balance sheets with the exception of the portion of securities deposited that are utilized in our securities lending program clearing firm deposits other than those retained in the form of cash are not included in our consolidated balance sheets securities lending transactions utilize a portion of the securities that clearing firms have deposited to satisfy their proprietary performance bond requirements securities lending activity fluctuates based on the amount of securities that clearing firms have deposited and the 

  

demand for securities lending activity in the particular securities available to us as a result of these factors the balances in cash performance bonds and security deposits as well as the balances in our securities lending program may fluctuate significantly over time the performance bonds and security deposits for nymex clearing firms have been included in total performance bonds and security deposits subsequent to the merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 

cash performance bonds and security deposits and collateral from securities lending consisted of the following at december 31 

 

 we are required under the commodity exchange act to segregate cash and securities deposited by clearing firms on behalf of customers in addition our exchange rules require a segregation of all funds and securities deposited by clearing firms from exchange operating funds and marketable securities as with cash performance bonds and security deposits these balances will fluctuate due to the investment choices available to clearing firms and the change in total deposits required securities at fair value and ief funds were deposited for the following purposes at december 31 

 

 in order to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities we use the threelevel framework established by sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” in general we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair values of the investments within marketable securities securities lending collateral and other equity investments the level 1 investments include us treasury securities exchange traded mutual funds repurchase agreements and publicly traded equity securities if quoted prices are not available to determine fair value we use other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly investments included in level 2 consist primarily of us government agency securities municipal bonds assetbacked securities and certain corporate bonds level 3 assets include certain corporate bonds and assetbacked securities these assets have been valued using valuation models with inputs that are both observable and unobservable the unobservable inputs used in these models are significant to the fair value of the investments and require management’s judgment 

we determine the fair value of the derivative contracts using standard valuation models that are based on marketbased observable inputs including forward and spot exchange rates and interest rate curves level 2 derivative assets include interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts 

the fair value of the liability for the guarantee of erps is derived using probabilityweighted blackscholes option values for various scenarios the liability is included in level 3 because management uses significant unobservable inputs including probability expected return and volatility factors to determine the fair value 

financial assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the asset or liability’s fair value measurement 

  

financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

 

 the following is a reconciliation of assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level 3 during 2008 

 

 due to market conditions we revalued a money market mutual fund investment within cme’s securities lending collateral using unobservable inputs during the third quarter of 2008 a financial institution defaulted on its obligation to the fund in the third quarter resulting in a decline in the fund’s market value we considered our exposure to potential loss due to the default and our ability to hold the investment in determining the fair value of the investment as a result of the revaluation we recorded an impairment charge of 60 million in securities lending interest and other costs during the year as the decline in value was determined to be otherthantemporary this investment was transferred into level 3 during the year because its fair value is based on management’s best estimate 

  

as a result of the merger with nymex holdings in august 2008 we acquired the collateral portfolio for the nymex securities lending program at december 31 2008 one corporate debt security in the portfolio was determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired due to default by the issuers we recorded an impairment charge of 183 million in the securities lending interest and other costs during the year these investments are included as purchases in level 3 as they were acquired as part of the merger in addition we have categorized certain assetbacked securities in the nymex securities lending portfolio in level 3 because their fair value was estimated using valuation models with unobservable inputs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates credit foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 

interest rate risk 

in conjunction with our nymex holdings merger in august 2008 we entered into multiple credit facilities as a result debt outstanding at december 31 2008 consisted of fixed rate borrowings of 22 billion and variable rate borrowings of 10 billion commercial paper is included in fixed rate borrowings however because maturities for commercial paper are generally less than 90 days it is considered subject to interest rate fluctuations borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations were as follows as of december 31 2008 

 

  

   credit risk 

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our exchange or on thirdparty exchanges for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including our clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products we typically hold performance bond collateral to cover at least 95 of price changes for a given product within a given historical period our clearing house markstomarket all open positions at least twice a day and more often if market volatility warrants providing both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract this allows our clearing house to 

  

identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions this transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits 

although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation these assets include security deposits performance bonds and any other available assets such as the proceeds from the sale of class a common stock and trading rights at cme cbot nymex and comex of the clearing firm and the class b common stock for cme clearing firms owned by or assigned to the clearing firm in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent of a clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our surplus funds security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit we maintain a committed 6000 million 364day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks we have the option to increase the facility from 6000 million to 10 billion subject to approval by the banks providing the additional commitments we are required to post additional collateral in connection with any such increase this line of credit may also be utilized if there is a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay settlement payments between our clearing house and clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as security deposit funds in our second ief program to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line 

the following shows the available assets of our clearing house at december 31 2008 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm 

 

  

     despite these safeguards we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

although our foreign operations have expanded as a result of recent business combinations our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk resulting from ongoing foreign operations is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results 

we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to the equity investments noted under equity price risk any foreign currency rate risk related to these investments is reflected in the unrealized loss presented in the table below 

equity price risk 

we hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded as available for sale at their fair value equity securities whose sale is restricted for greater than 12 months are carried at original cost net of impairment charges until the restriction is within 12 months of expiration at which time they are recorded at fair value 

fair values are based on quoted market prices or management’s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet dates fair values are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 

the table below summarizes our publiclytraded equity investments at december 31 2008 equity investments are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

 

  

   we do not currently hedge against equity price risk all equity securities are assessed for otherthantemporary impairment on a quarterly basis an assessment of whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired takes into consideration the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss at december 31 2008 we determined that our investment in bmf was impaired we recorded impairment of 3684 million of which 2745 million was recognized as an impairment loss in 2008 earnings the remaining 939 million of impairment which is related to changes in the foreign currency exchange rate was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss we determined that our other equity investments were not impaired at december 31 2008

our principal executive offices are located at 20 south wacker drive chicago illinois 60606 and our telephone number is 3129301000 

growth strategy 

increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives increased volatility technological advances and reduced regulatory barriers offer significant opportunities for growth we believe that we can capitalize on these trends and build on our competitive strengths by implementing the following strategies 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 growing the core business we intend to advance our position as a leader in the futures industry by generating organic growth through launching new products 

we have a strong track record of innovation continually launching new products and product line extensions in 2007 our new products and product extensions included 

 

 we plan to continue to work with existing and potential customers to develop new futures and options products that provide an array of relevant risk management tools 

  

penetrating the overthecounter market we intend to continue our initiatives to expand our business into overthecounter markets by developing overthecounter products and services and by entering these markets through acquisitions and strategic partnerships 

in response to the rapid increase in popularity of foreign exchange as an asset class and the advances in electronic trading we formed a joint venture with reuters group plc reuters to create the first centrally cleared global overthecounter foreign exchange marketplace — fxmarketspace limited fxms launched in march 2007 this strategic relationship complements our foreign exchange futures and options products and represents an opportunity for us to expand into the overthecounter foreign exchange marketplace 

swapstream is a global overthecounter electronic trading platform for interest rate swaps that we acquired in 2006 it offers products that provide dealers with the flexibility to interact with one or more banks one or more brokers or any combination of these to build their own marketplace and distribute their liquidity the platform also features a sophisticated permissionbased system that allows market participants to publish customized prices and pricing curves based on both credit and counterparty considerations we plan to launch cme swaps on the swapstream platform in the first half of 2008 cme swaps on swapstream are the first interest rate swaps that offer the full benefits of central counterparty clearing to the overthecounter marketplace combining the strengths of cme clearing360 our overthecounter clearing services and swapstream’s trading technology is evidence of our broader strategy of providing greater operational and cost efficiencies to trading standard overthecounter products 

additionally cbot began offering ethanol swap products which trade overthecounter and are cleared by cme clearing360 since their launch in 2006 more than 60000 contracts total have traded with open interest in excess of 20000 contracts 

leveraging our transaction processing services providing thirdparty transaction processing clearing and related services is a key element of our strategy we believe there are opportunities to expand our service offerings and further diversify our revenue streams in 2007 we generated 1064 million in revenues including 482 million from services provided to cbot prior to our merger from our transaction processing services it accounted for 6 of total revenues 

effective in june 2006 we became the exclusive electronic trading service provider for the newyork mercantile exchange’s nymex energy futures and options contracts and for metals products listed on its comex division this relationship accounted for 564 million of our processing services revenue in 2007 we also have an agreement with the brazilian mercantile  futures exchange sa bmf discussed below in more detail under “globalizing the business” it includes an orderrouting arrangement in which our cme globex distribution network would be connected to bmf’s distribution network 

as a result of the merger with cbot holdings we also list the products of the minneapolis grain exchange and the kansas city board of trade for trading on the cme globex platform 

we have a fast widely distributed and reliable derivatives trading platform in cme globex and we have a world class clearing house our goal is to offer processing services to our partners enhancing their ability to grow our relationships with cbot and nymex evidence our ability to leverage the scalable infrastructure we have built 

leveraging our technology technology remains a key component of our growth strategy our goal is to leverage our technology distribution and transaction processing we made significant enhancements to improve the speed functionality and reliability of our cme globex platform in 2007 we upgraded all match engines to improve performance during periods of peak activity cme globex handled an average daily volume of 60 million contracts in 2007 including average daily volume of 08 million nymex contracts with an alltime record of 142 million contracts 131 million for cme group and 11 million for nymex on august 16 2007 following the integration of cbot products onto cme globex our all time record was 195 million transactions 183 million for cme group including cbot contracts and 12 million for nymex on january 22 2008 cme globex has handled a peak order transaction load of 230 million orders and sent out a peak market data load of 163 million messages in a day 

advancing new business opportunities in july 2007 we completed our historic merger with cbot holdings our combined company creates operational and cost efficiencies for our customers the merger has allowed us to leverage each company’s distinct product lines for the benefit of customers around the world in january 2008 we successfully migrated cbot’s electronic commodities equity index and interest rate products onto the cme globex trading platform in the second quarter of 2008 we will consolidate the trading floors of the two exchanges to our 141 west jackson boulevard location in chicago in 2007 we achieved expense savings of 262 million we expect annual expense savings of more than 100 million in 2008 the bulk of the synergies will result from reducing technology and administrative costs and creating more efficient trading floor operations staff reductions of 380 existing and open positions will be complete by mid2008 

  

globalizing the business our goal is to expand and diversify our customer base worldwide and to offer customers around the world the most broadly diversified portfolio of benchmark products we also seek to deploy our technology and transaction processing services globally in 2007 we continued to deliver on this strategic initiative working with the korea exchange and the china foreign exchange trading system among others 

on february 26 2008 we completed our transaction with bmf for the purchase of a ten percent equity interest in bmf in exchange for approximately a two percent interest in cme group the transaction includes an orderrouting arrangement in which our cme globex electronic distribution network will be connected to bmf’s distribution network the arrangement is exclusive to cme for orderrouting services provided to bmf outside of china mexico central and south america and exclusive to bmf among exchanges in central and south america we also are contemplating additional initiatives with bmf including enabling bmf to become a “superclearing” member of cme group and establishing a joint working group to explore opportunities to develop and market new products for the brazilian and latin american markets 

also in 2007 we entered into a nonbinding letter of intent with the korea exchange for a proposed agreement to list the kospi 200 futures on the cme globex platform during nonkorean trading hours the proposed fiveyear agreement would include the creation of a telecom hub in seoul and would represent the first time the korea exchange has entered into a processing agreement relating to its kospi product line we believe this arrangement represents an important step in our expansion into asia which is a vital area of longterm growth potential for us 

we will continue to explore opportunities to position cme group to benefit from growth in key geographies through strategic investments and to capitalize on opportunities in asia and latin america by leveraging our diverse product offerings 

products 

we believe that the range and diversity of our products contribute significantly to our success we offer markets in futures and options on futures contracts based on the us interest rate yield curve equity indexes foreign exchange agricultural and industrial commodities energy and alternative investment products our products are traded through the cme globex electronic trading platform our open outcry auction markets or through privately negotiated transactions that we clear for the year ended december 31 2007 we derived 14 billion or 81 of our total revenues from fees associated with trading and clearing our products these fees include per contract charges for trade execution clearing and cme globex fees fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded the method of trade and the trading privileges of the customer making the trade generally members are charged lower fees than nonmembers certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our efforts to encourage increased liquidity in our markets our markets also generate valuable data and information regarding pricing and trading activity in our products we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” page 59 for the average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product lines for the last two years 

interest rate products our interest rate products enable banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks and in turn help to reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing our interest rate products allow our customers to execute transactions across the entire us dollardenominated yield curve using some of the world’s most actively traded futures and options products customers may manage short medium and longterm interest rate risk using our products based on eurodollars us treasuries swaps and other dollarrelated instruments as a result of our acquisition of cbot our interest rate products include cbot’s thirtyyear us treasury bond futures and options on futures and tenyear fiveyear and twoyear us treasury note futures and options we also offer cme credit index event contracts the first exchangetraded centrally cleared and guaranteed product available in the us credit derivatives market beginning in the fourth quarter we added futures and options products based on the lehman brothers us aggregate index the preeminent benchmark debt index for us investmentgrade fixed income securities 

  

sixty percent of our overall annual trading volume in 2007 was based upon our interest rate products the overall volume of our interest rate product line was up 73 compared to 2006 primarily due to our merger with cbot holdings 

we intend to increase our revenues from our interest rate product sector by leveraging cross marketing opportunities between cme and cbot interest rate products enhancing electronic liquidity in existing interest rate futures and options products and extending into the execution and clearing of overthecounter us dollar and nondollar interest rate derivative products through our launch of cme swaps on swapstream 

equity products our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure for hedging or speculative purposes to a change in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities by allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks our equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets 

we are a leading equity index marketplace offering futures and options products on key benchmark equity indexes covering small medium and largecap companies in the us europe and asia these include the standard  poor’s dow jones nasdaq nikkei msci and ftsexinhua indexes and others we have exclusive licensing arrangements with standard  poor’s corporation sp the nasdaq stock market inc nasdaq and dow jones  company inc dow jones which allow us to offer futures and options on futures on their indexes including our contracts based on the sp 500 index the nasdaq100 index and the dow jones industrial average for a detailed description of these licensing arrangements see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—licensing agreements” 

we also offer emini contracts which trade exclusively on our cme globex platform and are onefifth the size of their standard counterparts these products are designed to address the growing demand for equity derivatives and electronically traded products 

our total trading volume for equity products rose 53 in 2007 to 6679 million contracts trading in these products represented 30 of our total trading volume during 2007 

we believe our leading market position in equity products is a result of the liquidity of our markets the status of the sp 500 the nasdaq100 and the dow jones industrial average indexes as the principal us financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns and the appeal to investors and traders of our emini products and other equity products and our cme globex platform these investors include public and private pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets 

we believe future growth in our equity products will come from expanding customer access to our electronic markets and enhancing the functionality of our cme globex electronic platform to increase the electronic trading volume of our options on futures contracts as well as further educating the global marketplace on the benefits of these products 

foreign exchange products we became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in 1972 our foreign exchange market serves as an effective and efficient means of risk transfer for the global foreign exchange market bringing together a broad array of client segments by offering investment as well as risk management opportunities our customers benefit from dealing anonymously in a fully transparent market where large and small customers have equal access to the same prices and deep pool of liquidity our foreign exchange products provide the tools and resources to hedge foreign exchange risk facilitating crossborder trade and commerce while mitigating the risks to profitability due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market our foreign exchange market attracts both buy and sellside investors including commercial and investment banks hedge funds commodity trading advisors proprietary trading firms and individual investors approximately 92 of our foreign exchange products are traded electronically on the cme globex platform ensuring that business is transacted quickly with maximum operational efficiency 

today we offer approximately 40 foreign exchange futures and approximately 30 foreign exchange options on futures products covering major as well as a broad array of emerging market currency pairs in the following currencies euro japanese yen british pound swiss franc canadian dollar australian dollar new zealand dollar mexican peso brazilian real norwegian krone swedish krona czech koruna hungarian forint polish zloty russian ruble south african rand israeli shekel korean won and chinese renminbi 

  

in 2007 we saw an average daily volume of 569000 foreign exchange contracts per day with a notional value of 709 billion a day our total foreign exchange trading volume increased 27 in 2007 with a total of 1440 million contracts traded during the year trading in our foreign exchange products represented 6 of our total trading volume in 2007 in 2007 electronically traded foreign exchange volume increased 33 over 2006 to 1325 million contracts open outcry trading decreased 33 to 39 million contracts in 2007 

we believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and diversifying our product suite and customer base for example trading in volatilitybased options on six of our foreign exchange options will begin in march 2008 we are expanding our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array of customer segments and we expect continued strong growth in the electronic execution of foreign exchange options on cme globex in 2008 as we expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market we expect increased trading volume from customers outside of the united states 

commodity and alternative investment products our commodity products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management for the agricultural community these products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities including agricultural producers of commodities and food processors commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business we have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products including futures contracts based on cattle hogs pork bellies lumber and dairy products and now as a result of our acquisition of cbot have added contracts based on soybeans corn wheat oats rough rice gold and silver 

we also provide our customers with nontraditional alternative investment products to diversify and manage their risk our real estate products provide opportunities for protection in up and down markets and extend to the real estate industry the same financial tools that our previous innovations have brought to agriculture and finance by providing a means of hedging exposure to real estate prices customers can diffuse the potential impact of sustained declines in real estate prices our ethanol products offer a way for ethanol producers ethanol marketers and gasoline refiners to limit alternative fuel price risk in a highly volatile growing market faced with mounting regulatory and market pressures we also are the only regulated exchange that offers risk management products on the weather market through our weather contracts based on aggregate temperatures in 35 cities around the world as well as hurricane snowfall and frost indexes 

commodity and alternative investment products accounted for 4 of our trading volume during 2007 

we continue to execute our strategy of growing our customer base and providing sidebyside access to our commodity markets we believe the changing perception of commodities as an asset class provides an opportunity for growth in our markets 

market data and information products our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products that we believe enhances the trading activity in our products the dissemination of realtime data generates revenues and supports our customer base with timely market information we sell our market data which includes information about bids offers trades and trade size in our products to banks brokerdealers pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions we distribute our market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets through our electronic facilities we also distribute market data via dedicated networks to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges other third party data providers and news services and then resell their consolidated data revenues from market data products totaled 1451 million or 8 of our total revenues in 2007 

sophisticated quantitative approaches to risk management as well as customer time sensitivity have created new needs uses and demands for tradingrelated data and analytics we continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by creating new valueadded services to complement our market data products including databases analytical tools and other services to assist endusers in october 2007 we launched our new market data protocol named fixfast fixfast is the most recent step in our strategy to improve market data offerings in response to customer requests for faster and more efficient distribution of data combined with last year’s change to the market data platform dissemination method customers now have the latest technology available for obtaining our market information and prices 

as part of our market data and information products business we also supply services to sp and onechicago our joint venture with the chicago board options exchange inc cboe and interactive brokers group in connection with the usage reporting contract administration and associated billing and revenue collection for the display and integration of their market data into our standard market data distribution we are also the exclusive distributor of dow jones index data 

  

execution 

our primary trade execution facilities consist of our cme globex electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors both of these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency and are supported by substantial infrastructure and technology for order routing trade reporting market data dissemination and market surveillance and regulation in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house 

electronic trading our cme globex electronic trading platform maintains an electronic centralized order book and trade execution algorithm for futures contracts and options on futures contracts and allows users to enter orders directly into the order book in january 2008 we completed the migration of cbot’s agricultural interest and equity products to the cme globex platform cbot metals products continue to trade on ecbot powered by liffe connect 

in 2007 77 of our total trading volume was executed electronically compared with 71 in 2006 during 2007 approximately 77 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from electronic trading 

additionally we offer the ability to trade the us dollar british pound euro and swiss francdenominated mediumterm and longterm interest rate swaps and spread trades on the swapstream platform 

open outcry trading we also offer our members the ability to execute transactions in an openauction format on our trading floors—a centralized meeting place for traders and floor brokers to trade our products orders by market participants not physically located on the trading floor are communicated to floor brokers current market information and news are displayed on wallboards hung above the trading pits following the merger with cbot holdings we operate two separate trading floors for trading cme and cbot products in the second quarter of 2008 we will integrate the cme and cbot trading floors at one location at 141 w jackson boulevard in chicago open outcry trading represented 21 of our total trading volume in 2007 and accounted for approximately 16 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue 

privately negotiated transactions in addition to offering traditional open outcry and electronic trading through the cme globex platform we permit qualified customers to trade our products by entering into privately negotiated transactions which are reported and included in the market data we distribute we also clear settle and guarantee these transactions through our clearing house some market participants value privately negotiated transactions as a way to ensure that large transactions can be completed at a single price or in a single transaction while preserving their ability to effectively complete a hedging risk management or other trading strategy during 2007 approximately 7 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from this type of trading 

clearing 

we operate our own clearing house—cme clearing—that clears settles and guarantees the performance of all transactions matched through our execution facilities and on third party exchanges for which we provide clearing services up until the closing of the merger with cbot holdings we provided clearing services to cbot ownership and control of our own clearing house enables us to retain the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products by owning our clearing house we also control the cost structure and the technology development cycle for our clearing services it helps us manage our new product initiatives without being dependent on an outside entity it also benefits our customers by creating operational risk management and product benefits additionally owning our own clearing house allows us to generate additional revenue by providing clearing services to other exchanges in february 2007 we began clearing overthecounter foreign exchange products for fxms and we provide clearing services for onechicago 

in 2007 our clearing house cleared an average of 110 million contracts daily and 28 billion contracts overall which includes contracts cleared for cbot prior to the closing of the merger in july as of december 31 2007 our open interest stood at 540 million contracts and our open interest record was 752 million contracts set on august 9 2007 as of december 31 2007 we acted as custodian for approximately 599 billion in performance bond collateral deposited by our clearing firms and during 2007 we moved an average of approximately 22 billion a day in settlement funds through our clearing system in june 2007 the united kingdom’s financial services authority granted cme the status of a recognised overseas clearing house which enables us to provide global clearing services to market participants in the united kingdom and serve a wider range of those customers’ risk management needs in addition our clearing house guarantees the performance of all our contracts with a financial safeguards package of approximately 52 billion as of january 1 2008 

  

the clearing function provides three primary benefits to our markets efficient highvolume transaction processing cost and capital efficiencies and a reliable credit guarantee the services we provide can be broadly categorized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 transaction processing and position management  our clearing 21 system developed with nymex in the early 1990s processes reported trades and positions on a realtime basis providing users with instantaneous information on trades positions and risk exposure clearing 21 is able to process trades in futures and options products securities and cash instruments clearing 21 can also support complex new product types including combinations options on combinations options on options swaps repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other instruments through clearing 21 user interfaces our clearing firms can electronically manage their positions exercise options enter transactions related to foreign exchange deliveries manage collateral posted to meet performance bond requirements and access all of our other online applications together with our order routing and trade matching services we offer straightthrough electronic processing of transactions in which an order is electronically routed matched cleared and made available to the clearing firm’s backoffice systems for further processing 

market protection and risk management our clearing house guarantee of performance is a significant attraction and an important part of the functioning of our exchange because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products our clearing house uses our proprietary cme span software which determines the appropriate performance bond requirements by simulating the gains and losses of complex portfolios we typically hold performance bond collateral to cover at least 95 of price changes for a given product within a given historical period 

at each settlement cycle our clearing house values at the market price prevailing at that time or markstomarket all open positions and requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value our clearing house markstomarket all open positions at least twice a day and more often if market volatility warrants markingtomarket provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract 

having a marktomarket cycle of a minimum of two times a day helps protect the financial integrity of our clearing house our clearing firms and market participants this allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions this transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits 

  

in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation these assets include security deposits performance bonds and any other available assets such as the proceeds from the sale of class a common stock and trading rights at cme andor cbot as applicable of the clearing firm and the class b common stock for cme clearing firms owned by or assigned to the clearing firm in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent of a clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our surplus funds security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit we maintain a committed 800 million 364day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks we have the option to increase the facility from 800 million to 1 billion subject to approval by the participating banks we are required to post additional collateral in connection with any such increase this line of credit may also be utilized if there is a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay settlement payments between our clearing house and clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as security deposit funds in our second interest earning facility program ief2 to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line 

settlement collateral and delivery services we manage final settlement in all of our contracts including cash settlement physical delivery of selected commodities and option exercises and assignments because some initial and maintenance performance bonds from clearing firms as well as marktomarket obligations on some of our contracts are denominated in various foreign currencies we offer multicurrency performance bond and settlement services 

generally although more than 95 of all futures contracts are liquidated before the expiration of the contract the underlying financial instruments or commodities for the remainder of the contracts must be delivered we act as the delivery agent for all contracts ensuring timely delivery by the seller of the exact quality and quantity specified in a contract and full and timely payment by the buyer we also facilitate final settlement on a daily basis for cash foreign exchange transactions with fxms 

to administer its system of financial safeguards efficiently our clearing house has developed banking relationships with a network of major us banks and banking industry infrastructure providers such as the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications among the key services provided to our clearing house by these banks and service providers are a variety of custody credit and payment services that support the substantial financial commitments and processes backing the guarantee of our clearing house to market participants 

crossmargining and mutual offset services crossmargining arrangements reduce capital costs for clearing firms and customers these agreements permit an individual clearing house to recognize a clearing firm’s open positions at other participating clearing houses and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at other participating clearing houses this arrangement reduces the need for collateral deposits by the clearing firm for example our crossmargining program with the options clearing corporation reduced performance bond requirements for our members by approximately 30 billion a day in 2007 we have implemented crossmargining arrangements with nymex the fixed income clearing corporation and lchclearnet group for positions at the london international financial futures and options exchange that are cleared through lchclearnet group in addition our mutual offset agreement with the singapore derivatives exchange allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products and then transfer them back to the originating exchange this mutual offset arrangement enables firms to execute trades at either exchange virtually 24 hours per day this arrangement has been in place since 1984 and was renewed in october 2006 for an additional three year term with automatic renewals for one year each unless terminated by either party 

investment services in order to achieve collateral efficiencies for our clearing firms we have established a number of collateral programs under the designation interest earning facility ief under this program our clearing firms may select from four different ief programs to meet their individual needs the programs are designed to enable our clearing firms to make optimal use of the demand deposit cash accounts and security accounts they have established to satisfy our performance bond requirements we earn fee income in return for providing these valueadded services to our clearing firms 

  

our clearing house launched a securities lending program in 2001 using a portion of certain securities deposited to meet the proprietary performance bond requirements of our clearing firms under this securities lending program we lend a security to a third party and receive collateral in the form of cash the majority of the cash is then invested on an overnight basis to generate interest income the related interest expense represents payment to the borrower of the security for the cash collateral retained during the duration of the lending transaction securities on loan are markedtomarket daily and compared to collateral received 

technology 

our operation of both electronic and open outcry trading facilities and a clearing house has influenced the design and implementation of the technologies that support our operations 

trading technology we have a proven track record of operating successful electronic and open outcry markets by developing and integrating multiple evolving technologies that support a growing and substantial trading volume the integrated suite of technologies we employ to accomplish this has been designed to support a significant expansion of our current business and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our technology base into new markets products and services 

as electronic trading activity expands we continue to provide greater match engine functionality unique to various markets market models and product types we have adopted a modular approach to technology development and engineered an integrated set of solutions that support multiple specialized markets we continually monitor and upgrade our capacity requirements our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our historical peak transactions in our highest volume products significant investments in production planning quality assurance and certification processes have enhanced our ability to expedite the delivery of the system enhancements that we develop for our customers in 2007 we were focused on the planning and implementation of the migration of cbot products onto the cme globex platform this migration was completed in january 2008 with the exception of cbot metals products which will continue to trade on ecbot through midjuly 2008 we will continue to need to expand and upgrade our technology and systems to respond to increases in trading volume and order transaction traffic 

speed reliability scalability capacity and functionality are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms a substantial portion of our operating budget is dedicated to system design development and operations in order to achieve high levels of overall system performance in 2007 we continued our efforts to grow and enhance our electronic trading capabilities we also maintain remote data facilities to provide additional system capacity and redundancy for our trading and clearing technology our data centers support our customer interfaces trading and execution systems as well as clearing and settlement operations 

the technology systems supporting our trading operations can be divided into five major categories 

 

   

the cme globex electronic trading platform includes the distribution order routing order management trade matching and market data technology cme globex’s modularity and functionality enable us to selectively add products with unique trading characteristics onto the trading platform 

the distribution technologies we offer differentiate our platform and bring liquidity and trading volume to our execution facilities as of december 31 2007 we had more than 1100 direct connections with our systems for customers across the globe many of these customers connect through a dedicated private network that is readily available has wide distribution and provides fast connections in the americas europe and asia we have telecommunications hubs in amsterdam dublin london milan paris and singapore to respond to customer requests and reduce the cost of trading for our foreign customers in 2007 we closed the hub in gibraltar we plan to add hubs in seoul sao paulo and shanghai we plan to add distribution for bmf products in 2008 

in order routing and management we offer a range of mechanisms and were among the first us derivatives exchanges to implement the fix protocol—the standard order routing protocol used within the securities industry in addition our order routing and order management systems are capable of supporting multiple electronic trading match engines this functionality gives us great latitude in the types of markets that we choose to serve 

several key technology platforms and standards are used to support these activities including faulttolerant hewlett packard integrity nonstop servers that incorporate intel itanium processors ibm mainframes microsoft software hitachi and emc storage area network san equipment sun microsystems and hewlett packard servers oracle and db2 databases linux unix novell tibco middleware and multivendor network solutions 

our futures match engine is based upon the computerized trading and match software known as the nsc system we have a fully trained development team that maintains upgrades and customizes our version of the nsc system the customized enhancements that we have developed address the unique trading demands of each marketplace that we serve we continue to focus on performance features of the match engine in 2007 we upgraded all match engines to improve performance during periods of peak activity 

our options match engine was designed and built at cme with focus on the speed of matching buy and sell orders and fault tolerance for 24hour trading we work on continuous enhancements to build a fullyfunctional electronic marketplace for options where our customers can offset their risk with as much ease as in our open outcry trading facilities we also offer userdefined functionality for customers to create and trade customized spreads of instruments 

over the last three years we have made significant investments in market data technologies to support increased trading and messaging volumes enhancements include performance improvements scalability with a new multicast distribution platform and a fix 50 compliant messaging format these implementations benefit our customers through reducing required bandwidth costs and improved performance 

our merger with cbot holdings will allow us to incorporate their floor technologies into our combined operations these technologies facilitate sidebyside trading and provide enhanced pit trading capabilities 

clearing technology clearing 21 our clearing and settlement software and cme span our margining and risk management software form the core of our clearing technology 

clearing 21 is a system for highvolume highcapacity clearing and settlement of exchangebased transactions that we developed jointly with nymex in the early 1990s the system offers clearing firms improved efficiency and reduced costs clearing 21’s modular design gives us the ability to rapidly introduce new products the software can be customized to meet the unique needs of specialized markets 

cme span is our sophisticated margining and risk management software cme span has now been adopted by more than 50 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide this software simulates the effects of changing market conditions on a complex portfolio and uses standard options pricing models to determine a portfolio’s overall risk cme span then generates a performance bond requirement that typically covers 95 of price changes within a given historical period 

  

building services 

as a result of our merger with cbot holdings we now own and manage three buildings with over 15 million square feet of commercial space in the aggregate in the central business district of chicago as of december 31 2007 the buildings were about 90 occupied with approximately 32 of the total space used by us in september 2007 we began renovations on the cbot trading floor in connection with the migration of the cme trading floors from 20 south wacker drive to 141 west jackson boulevard in chicago which is expected to occur beginning in april 2008 

tenants pay market rates for rent the majority of tenant leases have terms of three to five years with large tenants generally having leases for up to nineteen years as of december 31 2007 the largest tenant other than us leased approximately 8 of the rentable area and the next five largest tenants leased about 18 of the rentable area we manage both the real estate and the general services relating to such real estate such as cleaning power and telephone services through our whollyowned subsidiary cbt corporation building services generated about 1 of our total revenues in 2007 

cbot previously spent considerable resources so that all three buildings have advanced electrical mechanical and telecommunications infrastructure and services the demographics of the tenants of our commercial space have begun to widen beyond traditional brokeragetrading service firms to include other financial services firms which we believe is due to the location and desirable electrical telecommunications and mechanical infrastructure of our buildings we expect additional tenants who previously leased space at 10 and 30 south wacker drive to move to 141 west jackson in connection with the migration of the cme trading floors 

in 2004 a proposal was approved by the chicago city council redesignating the propertytax classification for the landmark building at 141 w jackson in chicago as “class l” in order to provide assistance in connection with renovations the class l classification is expected to lower our property taxes by about 14 million over 12 years beginning with our 2008 real estate taxes payable in 2009 the reduction in property tax assessments associated with the class l designation is available to owners renovating landmark buildings the north facade and lobby of the 141 w jackson building have been city landmarks since 1977 but a separate ordinance extended protected status to all four facades as part of the class l incentive we agreed to a major renovation of the north building consisting of the renovation and cleaning of the façade a full elevator modernization renovation of the lobby and various other aesthetic and infrastructure improvements 

business continuity planning 

we continue to strengthen and upgrade our disaster recovery facilities and capabilities we have dedicated significant resources to improve our continuity planning for example our disaster recovery infrastructure and activities include 

 

  

  

 additionally in order to ensure proper coordination during a potential crisis we have established relationships with the local business community law enforcement and local and regional governmental emergency agencies 

strategic relationships 

we continually review our growth strategy and whether it is in the interests of our shareholders to engage in discussions with other parties regarding various strategic acquisitions partnerships divestitures and other arrangements and alliances 

  

the following is a summary of our key strategic relationships 

bmf on february 26 2008 we completed our transaction with bmf for the purchase of a ten percent equity stock in bmf in exchange for approximately two percent stake in cme group the transaction includes an orderrouting arrangement in which our cme globex electronic distribution network will be connected to bmf’s distribution network the arrangement is exclusive to us for orderrouting services provided to bmf outside of china mexico central and south america and exclusive to bmf among exchanges in central and south america

reuters in may 2006 we entered into an agreement with reuters to create fxms the first centrallycleared global foreign exchange marketplace through a joint venture owned 50 each by cme holdings and reuters we provide the joint venture with trade matching central counterparty clearing and market regulation services reuters provides the joint venture with graphical user interface access data distribution and trade notification services fxms offers market solutions to capitalize on the growing demand for broader access to the foreign exchange market the emergence of foreign exchange as an asset class the growth of nonbank financial institutions in global foreign exchange markets and the growth of electronic and algorithmic trading fxms operates alongside existing electronic transactional systems including reuters dealing 3000 for interbank trading reuters trading for foreign exchange for dealer to buyside connectivity and our foreign exchange futures and options markets on our cme globex platform 

singapore derivatives exchange ltd in october 2006 we renewed our mutual offset agreement with the singapore derivatives exchange for an additional threeyear term this relationship allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products then transfer them back to the originating exchange 

we also currently have memoranda of understanding with several key global markets to meet increased demands for our products including the taiwan futures exchange shanghai stock exchange and the korea exchange these memoranda of understanding generally provide for the exchange of information about listing new products changes to existing contract specifications and trading methods 

as a result of the merger with cbot holdings we also list the products of the minneapolis grain exchange and the kansas city board of trade on the cme globex platform and act as their sole distributor of market data 

marketing programs and advertising 

our marketing programs align our core business objectives and product line goals with positioning messaging and customer targeting strategies designed to increase awareness and use of our products the marketing strategy and tactics include conducting market research to gather customer insight and the implementation of our marketing campaigns which may include online and print advertising direct marketing public relations online marketing and educational programs 

our marketing programs primarily target institutional customers and to a lesser extent individual traders our marketing programs for institutional customers aim to inform traders portfolio managers corporate treasurers and other market professionals about novel uses of our products such as new hedging and risk management strategies we also strive to educate these users about changes in product design performance bond requirements and new clearing services we participate in major domestic and international trade shows and seminars regarding futures contracts and options on futures contracts and other derivatives products in addition we sponsor educational workshops and marketing events designed to educate market users about our products through these relationships and programs we attempt to understand the needs of our customer base and use information provided by them to drive our product development efforts

our marketing program includes cme magazine a quarterly publication designed to keep our customers uptodate on developments that can enhance their successful participation in the derivatives industry the magazine features customer case histories new product information technology updates trend stories and news briefs and is made available on our web site 

competition 

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify we encounter competition in all aspects of our business including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime prior to the passage of the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 cfma futures trading was required to take place on or subject to the rules of a federally designated contract market the costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation and corresponding regulatory requirements created significant barriers to entry for competing exchanges the passage of the cfma and other changing market dynamics have led to increasing competition from a number of different domestic and international sources of varied size business objectives and resources we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and others 

competition in our derivatives business 

we believe competition among exchanges in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets diverse product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to expand globally develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs 

  

over the past few years there have been significant changes in the industry’s landscape as a result of the wave of consolidation and increased competition for example during the past two years in addition to our merger with cbot holdings the following consolidations occurred 

 

  

  

 at the end of 2007 there were 60 futures exchanges located in 33 countries including 11 exchanges in the united states additionally in the last three months there has been an increase in activity among derivative dealers banks and other entities to form competing exchanges in december 2007 a consortium of 12 financial institutions announced their intention to form an exchange – referred to as project four seasons – and project rainbow was recently formed to discuss launching a european derivatives exchange project four seasons has stated their intention to offer futures products that would be similar to our interest rate products the existence of these consortiums may increase competitive pressure on us 

because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets we also compete with nyse euronext and other securities and options exchanges dealer markets and alternative trading systems in this product line 

overthecounter markets for foreign exchange and fixedincome derivatives products also compete with us the largest foreign exchange markets are operated primarily as electronic trading systems two of the largest of these operated by electronic brokering services and reuters serve primarily professional foreign exchange trading firms additional electronic platforms designed to serve corporate foreign exchange users have emerged two of these are operated by consortia of interdealer and interbank market participants a third is a proprietary trading system in addition certain provisions of the cfma have led to an increase in unregulated electronic and brokerage trading systems in the foreign exchange market 

the overthecounter fixedincome derivatives market is by far the largest fixedincome derivatives marketplace the overthecounter market consists primarily of interbank and interdealer market participants there is currently no single liquidity pool in the overthecounter fixedincome derivatives market that is comparable to our eurodollar market the overthecounter market for fixedincome derivatives products has traditionally been limited to more customized products and the large credit exposures created in this market and the absence of clearing facilities have limited participation to the most creditworthy institutional participants however the size of this market and technologydriven developments in electronic trading and clearing facilities as well as regulatory changes implemented by the cfma increase the likelihood that one or more substantial liquidity pools will emerge in the future in the overthecounter fixedincome derivatives market 

alternative trade execution facilities that currently specialize in the trading of equity securities have electronic trade execution and routing systems that also can be used to trade products that compete with our products 

we also face a threat of trading volume loss if a significant number of our traditional participants decide to trade futures or similar products among themselves without using any exchange or specific trading system the cfma allows nearly all of our largest customers to transact futures or similar products directly with each other while those transactions raise liquidity and credit concerns they may be attractive based on execution costs flexibility of terms negotiability of margin or collateral deposits or other considerations additionally changes under the cfma permitting the establishment of standalone clearing facilities for futures and overthecounter derivatives transactions will facilitate the mitigation of creditrisk concentrations arising from such transactions 

  

competition in our transaction processing business 

in addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services including 

 

  

 in the past few years there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services we compete with other derivatives exchanges that provide clearing services as well as with some of our largest customers who are part of clearing organizations for example in december 2007 the clearing corporation ccorp completed a corporate restructuring resulting in ownership of ccorp by 17 stockholders including 12 major global dealers three leading interdealer brokers and eurex in addition to continuing to provide traditional clearing services to multiple exchanges and marketplaces the reconstituted ccorp has stated that it will expand its product line to include a centralized clearing facility for a number of overthecounter derivatives products we believe that other exchanges may also undertake to provide clearing services 

we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the cost of the services provided quality and reliability of the services timely delivery of the services reputation and value of linking with existing products markets and distribution 

competition in our market data business 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent potential competitors because as purveyors of market data these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities as technology firms they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks additionally technology and software firms that develop trading systems hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets 

this may lead to decreased demand for our market data 

regulatory matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the commodity futures trading commission cftc under the commodity exchange act the commodity exchange act generally requires that futures trading in commodities be conducted on a commodity exchange designated as a contract market by the cftc the act establishes nonfinancial criteria for an exchange to be designated to list futures and options contracts designation as a contract market for the trading of a specified futures contract is nonexclusive this means that the cftc may designate additional exchanges as contract markets for trading the same or similar contracts 

the cfma created a flexible regulatory framework for us in our capacity as a cftc registrant and eliminated many prescriptive requirements of the commodity exchange act and cftc in favor of more broad and flexible core principles for instance cftcregulated exchanges may now list new contracts and adopt new rules without prior cftc approval under selfcertification procedures permitting timelier product launch and modification 

  

for regulated markets the cfma created a threetiered regulatory structure the degree of regulation is related to the characteristics of the product and the type of customer that has direct or indirect access to the market with retail customer markets being subject to greater regulation the threetiered regulatory structure is as follows 

 

  

  

 our existing market which trades a broad range of products and permits intermediaries to represent unsophisticated customers is subject to the most thorough oversight as a designated contract market the cfma permits us to organize markets that are subject to lesser regulation depending on the types of products traded and the types of traders markets can be organized that trade only products that are unlikely to be susceptible to manipulation and permit direct trading only among institutional participants in order to achieve a less intrusive degree of oversight for example we were able to launch swapstream as an “exempt board of trade” under the cfma 

we have also “notice registered” with the securities exchange commission sec as a special purpose national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading security futures products as a result the sec is authorized to review some of our rules relating to these security futures products our members trading those products are subject to registration requirements and duties and obligations to customers under the securities laws that do not pertain to their other futures business 

the cfma also provides for regulation of derivatives clearing organizations dco like our clearing house separately from the exchanges for which they clear contracts and permits dcos to clear a range of overthecounter traded products in addition to products traded on an exchange the cfma requires a dco that clears for a registered futures exchange to register with the cftc however our clearing house was deemed to be registered by reason of its activities prior to enactment of the cfma our clearing house is required to comply with a separate set of flexible core principles that specifically apply to clearing houses a dco may accept for clearing any new contract or may adopt any new rule or rule amendment by providing to the cftc a written certification that the new contract rule or rule amendment complies with the commodity exchange act alternatively the dco may request that the cftc grant prior approval to any contract rule or rule amendment and the cftc must grant approval within 75 days unless the cftc finds that the proposed contract rule or rule amendment would violate the commodity exchange act 

cme and cbot are separate selfregulatory organizations responsible for ensuring market integrity and financial security for all transactions in their products although cbot outsources responsibility for trade matching regulatory and clearing services to cme our integrated compliance and market surveillance functions allow detailed tracking of all trading and clearing activities in addition our markets are subject to oversight by the cftc our regulatory processes are reviewed and audited by the cftc demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “selfregulation” that has been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program on february 1 2007 the cftc issued recommendations as to an appropriate means for designated contract markets to comply with the core principle requiring selfregulatory organizations to mitigate potential conflicts of interest the recommendations require at least 35 of the board of directors of a designated contract market to be directors with no material relationship with the exchange including memberships on the exchange the cftc has not promulgated an effective date for and is currently reviewing its recommendations as a result of our merger our board of directors is now comprised of 30 members of which nine have no industry affiliation other than service on our board we have not yet completed our assessment as to whether such directors would be considered to have no material relationship with the exchange for purposes of the cftc recommendation to the extent we are not in compliance we will be required to demonstrate to the cftc how we otherwise meet the requirements of the core principle 

  

the safe harbor also requires that such exchanges have in place a regulatory oversight committee comprised solely of nonindustry directors in april 2004 we became the first futures exchange to appoint a boardlevel committee devoted to selfregulatory oversight the committee is called the market regulation oversight committee and is comprised solely of independent nonindustry directors the committee provides independent oversight of the policies and programs of our market regulation department to ensure effective administration of our exchanges’ selfregulatory responsibilities 

from time to time it is proposed in congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated including a possible merger between the cftc and the sec for example in 2007 the us department of the treasury solicited comments as part of its evaluation of the regulatory structure associated with financial institutions while those proposals have not been adopted to date and the department of the treasury has not released any recommendations from its study the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely to the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

the cfma excluded or exempted many of the activities of our nonexchange competitors from regulation under the commodity exchange act the cfma created broad exclusions and exemptions from the commodity exchange act that permit derivatives contracts which may serve the same or similar functions as the contracts we offer to be sold in the largely unregulated overthecounter market including through electronic trading facilities 

additionally the cfma permits secregulated and bank clearing organizations to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that clearing organizations have traditionally cleared the cfma also permits banks and brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to offer and sell foreign exchange futures to retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act 

the cftc’s authorization expired in 2005 however reauthorization was not concluded and will continue through the 2008 legislative session as part of that process various concepts were mentioned as possible areas in which legislation would be appropriate while we are unaware of any legislative proposal at the present time arising from the reauthorization that would materially affect our business any such proposal may be introduced during this process additionally from time to time including in 2008 the proposed presidential budget has included a proposal to impose a transaction tax on futures traded domestically while many participants in the futures industry including us vigorously oppose this proposal we cannot guarantee that such proposal will not be enacted which may adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level 

our members 

as a result of our merger with cbot holdings we now operate two separate selfregulatory exchanges cme and cbot individuals may be members at one or both exchanges to trade our products members are individual traders as well as most of the world’s largest banks brokerages and investment houses trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by members members can execute trades for their own accounts for clearing firm accounts for the accounts of other members or for the accounts of customers of clearing firms members who trade for their own account including those who lease trading rights qualify for lower transaction fees in recognition of the market liquidity that their trading activity provides these members also benefit from market information advantages that may accrue from their proximity to activity on the trading floors generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers in 2007 our members were responsible for 80 of our total trading volume as of december 31 2007 there were approximately 120 clearing firms membership applicants planning to access the trading floor are subject to a review and approval process prior to becoming members and obtaining trading rights membership in an exchange entitles members to appear on the floor of the exchange during business hours and act as a floor broker andor floor trader executing trades in the contracts that are eligible within their membership division at the exchange applicants for membership are required to be of good moral character reputation and business integrity they must also have adequate financial resources and credit to assume the responsibilities and privileges of membership all members must understand the rules and regulations of the applicable exchange and agree to abide by them additionally they must comply with the provisions of the commodity exchange act and the rules and regulations issued by the cftc 

  

our market regulation department is the investigative and enforcement arm of our exchanges with regard to exchange rules members who are found to have violated a rule can be subject to sanctions such as fines trading suspensions andor expulsion from the particular exchange 

our shareholder relations and membership services department maintains an auction market for trading rights at cme and cbot 

cme memberships 

there are four divisions of membership at cme the chicago mercantile exchange cme division the international monetary market imm division the index and option market iom division and the growth and emerging markets gem division each membership division has different trading rights we have individual trading members corporate equity or trading member firms and clearing member firms 

under the terms of cme group’s certificate of incorporation members of the cme exchange as class b shareholders have the ability to protect their rights to trade by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of the markets and are entitled to elect six of the 30 directors on our board in particular the certificate of incorporation grants the holders of our class b common stock the right to approve any changes to the trading floor rights access rights and privileges that a member has the number of memberships in each membership class and the related number of authorized shares in each class of class b common stock and the eligibility requirements to exercise trading rights or privileges class b shareholders must approve any changes to these special rights class b shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and receive the same dividend payments as our class a shares 

cbot memberships 

there are five series of class b memberships in cbot represented by memberships in our cbot subsidiary series b1 full members series b2 associate members series b3 gim members series b4 idem members and series b5 com members 

class b members of cbot do not possess the right to receive any dividends or distributions including the proceeds from liquidation from cbot series b1 and b2 members have the right to vote on amendments to certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation of cbot including the number of authorized memberships the relative voting rights of the series b1 and b2 members the trading rights voting rights and core rights of class b members and certain other covenants and the commitment to maintain open outcry markets 

additionally during the fiveyear period following the merger we are required to provide the cbot directors as defined in the bylaws with five business days’ advance notice of any change to cbot’s rules and regulations if a majority of the cbot directors determine in their sole discretion that the proposed change will materially impair the business of cbot or the business opportunities of the holders of the class b memberships of cbot such change will be submitted to a committee of the board of directors of cbot comprised of three cbot directors and two cme directors as defined in the bylaws

we regularly review our intellectual property to identify property that should be protected the extent of current protection for that property and the availability of additional protection we believe our various trademarks and service marks have been registered or applied for where needed we also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law we have copyright registrations for certain of our software user manuals and databases legal developments allowing patent protection for methods of doing business hold the possibility of additional protection which we are pursuing

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 

risks relating to our business 

shareholders who own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchanges account for 20 of the 30 directors on our board these shareholders may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their rights to elect directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

twenty of our 30 directors on our board own or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchange we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges in addition trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets our trading members many of whom act as floor brokers and floor traders benefit from trading rules membership privileges and fee discounts that enhance their open outcry trading opportunities and profits our predominantly electronic trading members benefit from fee discounts and other incentives targeted at increasing electronic trading volume these benefits enhance their electronic trading opportunities and profits our clearing firms benefit from all of the foregoing as well as decisions that increase electronic trading which over time will reduce their costs of doing business on our exchanges as a result holders of our class a common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the role they serve in our markets their method of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us 

the board representation rights of the members of our cme exchange to elect six directors in combination with the charter provision protections described in the immediately following risk factor could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value 

our members have been granted special rights which protect their trading rights require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and in the case of our class b shareholders provide them with special board representation 

under the terms of the certificates of incorporation of cme group and cbot our members have the ability to protect their rights to trade on the respective exchange by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of our trading floor including whether we are required to maintain open outcry trading of a particular product our class b shareholders who are members of our cme exchange are also entitled to elect six of the 30 directors on our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent 

the certificates of incorporation of cme group and cbot also include provisions requiring us to maintain open outcry floor trading for a particular traded product as long as the open outcry market is “liquid” we are also required to maintain a facility for conducting business disseminating price information clearing and delivery and to provide reasonable financial support for technology marketing and research for open outcry markets these certificates of incorporation provide specific tests as to whether an open outcry market will be deemed liquid as measured on a quarterly basis if a market is deemed illiquid as a result of a failure to meet any of these tests our board may determine whether such market should be closed 

  

additionally we are required until our 2012 annual meeting to provide advance notice to the ten members of our board who were formally directors of cbot holdings prior to the merger or their successors of any changes to cbot exchange rules except for certain limited administrative changes if a majority of the cbot directors decide that the proposed rule change would materially impair the cbot business or materially impair the business opportunities of the cbot members then the proposed rule change must be submitted to a committee comprised of three cbot directors and two directors who were directors of cme holdings prior to the merger or their successors for final approval 

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

we generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees and our processing services provided to third parties we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future each of these revenue sources is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets and in the markets we provide processing services our trading volume is directly affected by us domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets our operating results and trading volume tend to increase during periods of uncertainty this is because our customers seek to hedge or manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange commodity and other markets the future economic environment may be subject to periodic downturns including possible recession and lower volatility in financial markets and may not be as favorable as it has been in recent years for example recent events in the economic environment including the subprime lending crisis the downturn in the housing market and decreases in consumer spending may result in an economic recession in the near future as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful trends less favorable than those of recent periods could result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability will be adversely affected 

  

the success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our current overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform however during 2007 21 of our volume and approximately 16 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was generated through our open outcry trading facilities most of our open outcry volume is related to trading in options on our futures contracts our electronic functionality may not be capable of accommodating all of the complex trading strategies typically used for trading options on futures contracts for example 92 of our eurodollar options contracts are traded via open outcry despite our initiatives to implement advanced functionality we intend to continue to introduce functionality that will accommodate complex trading strategies electronically however we may not complete the development of or successfully implement the required electronic functionality for our options on futures contracts moreover our customers who trade options may not accept our electronic trading systems in either event our ability to increase trading volume of options on futures contracts on the cme globex platform would be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality performance capacity reliability and speed we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading 

the enhancement of our electronic trading platform exposes us to risks inherent in operating in the evolving market for electronic transaction services if we do not successfully continue to enhance our electronic trading platform or if our customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or our current or potential customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

if we are not able to keep up with rapid technological changes our business will be materially harmed 

to remain competitive we must continue to improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and other features of our software network distribution systems and technologies the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology changes in customer demand and uses of derivatives products and transaction processing services frequent product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing technology and systems obsolete our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological advancements and changing standards in a timely costefficient and competitive manner we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our technology to customer and competitive requirements or emerging industry standards 

  

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business will not survive 

the derivatives securities and financial services industries are highly competitive we expect that competition will continue to intensify in the future our current and prospective competitors both domestically and around the world are numerous they include securities and securities option exchanges futures exchanges overthecounter markets clearing organizations market data and information vendors electronic communications networks crossing systems and similar entities consortia of large customers consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities at december 31 2007 there were 60 futures exchanges located in 33 countries including 11 futures exchanges in the united states the global derivatives industry has grown increasingly competitive exchanges intermediaries and even end users are consolidating and overthecounter and unregulated entities are constantly evolving additionally in response to growing competition many marketplaces in both europe and the united states have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth in 2007 we completed our merger with cbot holdings nyse group completed its merger with euronext and ice acquired the new york board of trade and the winnipeg commodity exchange also in the last three months there has been a significant increase in activity among derivative dealers banks and other entities to form competing exchanges in december 2007 a consortium of 12 financial institutions announced their intention to form an exchange – referred to as project four seasons – and in january 2008 project rainbow was formed to discuss launching a european derivatives exchange project four seasons has stated their intention to offer futures products that would be similar to our interest rate products 

we believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies the number of businesses providing internetrelated financial services is rapidly growing other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may become competitive with us through acquisitions changes in federal law allow institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar products to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can in addition our competitors may 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed 

a decline in our fees or any loss of customers could lower our revenues which would adversely affect our profitability 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure for example we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period for example our average rate per contract decreased to 0634 for the year ended december 31 2007 from 0645 for the same period in 2006 because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

generally we have experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

the cfma has reduced the barriers of entry into our markets which has led to increased competition and enabled many of our customers to trade futures contracts other than on exchanges these changes may adversely affect our trading volume revenue and profits 

our industry has been subject to several fundamental regulatory changes including changes in the statute under which we have operated since 1974 the commodity exchange act generally required all futures contracts to be executed on an exchange that had been approved by the cftc the “exchange trading requirement” was modified by cftc regulations and interpretations to permit privately negotiated swap contracts to be transacted in the overthecounter market the cftc exemption under which the overthecounter derivatives market operated precluded the overthecounter market from using exchangelike electronic transaction systems and clearing facilities these barriers to competition from the overthecounter market were repealed by the cfma one of the chief beneficiaries of the cfma has been overthecounter dealers and competitors that operate or intend to open electronic trading facilities or to conduct their futures business directly among themselves on a bilateral basis the customers who may access these trading facilities or engage in bilateral private transactions are the same customers who account for a substantial portion of our trading volume the cfma also permits banks brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to engage in foreign exchange futures transactions for or with retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act these customers are the same customers who might otherwise use our foreign exchange products 

the cfma also permits bank clearing organizations and clearing organizations regulated by the sec to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that these clearing organizations have traditionally cleared this allocation of jurisdiction may be advantageous to competing clearing organizations and result in a lower volume of trading cleared through our clearing house 

in the future our industry may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely impact our business including our ability to compete with enterprises that offer offexchange trading and benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lowercost business model 

  

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution alternatives our success also depends on our ability to maintain our trading volume and to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers for example the majority of the clearing and transaction fees we receive from our clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers we believe that in the event one of our clearing firms discontinues operations the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm however we cannot guarantee you that the discontinuation of any clearing firm would not result in our loss of customers which could have an adverse effect on our trading volumes or revenues we also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to lowcost competitors with comparable or superior products services or trade execution facilities if we fail to maintain our trading volume expand our product offerings or execution facilities or we lose a substantial number of our current customers or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of trading volume in a particular product line or are unable to attract new customers our business will be adversely affected 

any significant decline in the trading volume of our eurodollar or sp 500 futures and options on futures contracts would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we are substantially dependent on trading volume from two product offerings for a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits the clearing and transaction fees revenue attributable to transactions in eurodollar contracts and all our contracts based on the sp 500 including emini products approximated 32 and 24 respectively of our total clearing and transaction fees revenue during the year ended december 31 2007 and 46 and 26 respectively during the year ended december 31 2006 any significant decline in our trading volume in either of these products would negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results 

we believe our eurodollar futures contract serves as a global financial benchmark but we cannot assure you that in the future other products will not become preferred alternatives to our eurodollar contract as a means of managing or speculating on interest rate risk we also cannot assure you that competitors will not enter the eurodollar market our members may also elect to trade eurodollars in privately negotiated bilateral transactions without the use of our clearing house in either of these events our trading volume revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

our license agreement with sp provides that the sp 500 index futures products will be exclusive through december 31 2008 after which we will retain our exclusive rights through december 31 2016 so long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreement with sp in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments including securities and options based on the sp indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond the jurisdictional reach of us andor our licensors 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties our financial condition will be adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our exchange or on thirdparty exchanges for which we provide clearing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including our clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons we cannot guarantee you that one of our clearing firms will not default on its obligations in the future our surplus funds are at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its performance bond and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default additionally the default of any one of our clearing firms could cause our customers to lose confidence in our markets and the guarantee of our clearing house which would have an adverse affect on our business 

  

a key element of our strategy is to provide transaction processing clearing and related services to third parties if we are unable to continue to realize the benefits from providing these services our revenues will be adversely impacted 

providing thirdparty transaction processing clearing and related services is a key element of our strategy we have an agreement with nymex which began in june 2006 to be the exclusive trading service provider for nymex’s energy futures and options contracts and certain of their other products on our cme globex platform the initial term of the nymex agreement is for ten years from the date of launch with rolling threeyear extensions additionally prior to our merger with cbot holdings we derived a significant amount of revenue from our transaction processing services agreement that we entered into with cbot in 2003 in 2007 2006 and 2005 we generated 482 million 758 million and 687 million respectively in processing services revenue from our agreement with cbot and we generated 564 million 143 million and 45 million in revenue in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively from our agreement with nymex our future revenues from providing processing services to nymex or others will be dependent on the third party’s trading volume which is subject to a number of factors beyond its control for example nymex’s ability to maintain or expand its trading volume and operate its business as a futures exchange is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject any significant decrease in the trading volume at these exchanges will result in a corresponding decrease in our realized benefits from our processing services agreements our net income from the processing services we provide will also depend on our ability to control our costs associated with providing such services 

we cannot assure you that we will enter into additional agreements to provide processing services or that our existing agreement with nymex will not be terminated prior to the end of its term or that any agreement would be renewed after its initial term or that any renewal will be on terms as favorable to us for example under the terms of our agreement with nymex either party between the fifth and sixth anniversary of the first launch date may terminate the contract by providing notice and paying the other party a termination fee any such event could have an adverse effect on our revenues 

our market data fees may be reduced or eliminated by decreased demand or the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems if we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we will experience a reduction in revenue 

we sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data totaled 1451 million representing 8 of our total revenues and 808 million or 7 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively a decrease in overall trading volume may also lead to a decreased demand for our market data from the market data vendors additionally electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate charges for supplying market data to trading terminals if we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals we will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost quote fee revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar events if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled for example we have experienced technical failures that resulted in a temporary suspension of trading on the cme globex platform the impact of these events has not been material however we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not be material 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

  

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not–for–profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets 

some of our largest clearing firms which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with the futures industry association have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms additionally in january 2008 the us department of justice submitted a comment letter to the us department of the treasury in response to the department of the treasury’s request for comment on the regulatory regime of the financial services industry the comment letter stated that vertical integration of futures clearing houses impedes competition and should be reconsidered our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish or seek to use alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchanges even if they are not successful in their efforts the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets if any of these events occur our revenues and profits would be adversely affected 

we depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption in or the cessation of an important supply or service by any third party and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all would result in lost revenue and higher costs 

our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities we could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems 

we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by breaches although we intend to continue to implement security measures these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities 

  

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

although the cfma significantly reduced our regulatory burdens we remain extensively regulated by the cftc our international operations may be subject to similar regulations in specific jurisdictions we are registered in a number of countries outside the united states in some cases our registrations are subject to annual review and such reviews may subject us to additional requirements in the future we may also be required to register or become subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in order to accept business from customers in those jurisdictions 

many aspects of our operations are subject to oversight and regulation by the cftc our activities relating to single stock and narrowbased stock index futures products are also subject to oversight by the sec our operations are subject to ongoing review and oversight including 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization 

the cftc has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with its rules and regulations we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations we also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the cftc or other agencies 

demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “selfregulation” that has been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program on february 1 2007 the cftc issued recommendations as to an appropriate means for designated contract markets to comply with the core principle requiring selfregulatory organizations to mitigate potential conflicts of interest the recommendations require at least 35 of the board of directors of a designated contract market to be directors with no material relationship with the exchange including memberships on the exchange the cftc has not announced an effective date and is currently reviewing these recommendations as a result of our merger with cbot holdings our board of directors is now comprised of 30 members of which nine have no industry affiliation other than service on our board we have not yet completed our assessment as to whether such directors would be considered to have no material relationship with the exchange for purposes of the cftc recommendation we cannot guarantee that our board will be in compliance with the recommendations to the extent we are not in compliance we will be required to demonstrate to the cftc how we otherwise meet the requirements of the core principle 

from time to time it is proposed in congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated including a possible merger between the cftc and the sec for example in 2007 the us department of the treasury solicited comments as part of its evaluation of the regulatory structure associated with financial institutions while those proposals have not been adopted to date the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely to the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years which was scheduled to be completed in 2005 this process is still ongoing and could result in legislation that may have a negative impact on the way we operate our exchange including our ability to operate our selfregulatory functions or effectively compete with new entrants into our market place 

  

from time to time including most recently in 2008 the president’s budget includes a proposal that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions while those proposals have not been adopted to date except for a percontract fee imposed under the securities exchange act of 1934 on single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits 

changes in laws regulations or governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on the way we conduct our business 

our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

generally the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which can be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational legal and regulatory risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks while we enjoy governmental immunity for some of our marketrelated activities we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees and agents including employees of gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that engages primarily in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions for example employees of gfx enter into transactions to promote liquidity in foreign exchange contracts on the cme globex platform and subsequently enter into offsetting transactions using futures contracts or spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market to limit market risk in the event the offsetting transaction is not entered into or is not timely or properly executed we could be exposed to substantial market risk 

  

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we have experienced significant growth in our business continued growth may require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described in the following risk factor through acquisitions or other strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

our acquisition investment and alliance strategy involves risks if we are unable to effectively manage these risks our business will be materially harmed 

to achieve our strategic objectives in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies businesses or technologies acquisitions entail numerous risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we may not be able to integrate successfully any operations personnel services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future see “risks relating to the merger with cbot holdings” for additional risks 

additionally we may need to incur significant indebtedness in order to finance future acquisitions such indebtedness may 

 

  

  

 we also may seek to expand or enhance some of our operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest and potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we cannot assure you that any joint venture or alliance that we have entered into or may enter into in the future will be successful 

  

the imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at or otherwise offset by a fungible position existing at another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business 

in connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the cfma contemplates that clearing houses will establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house if in the future a similar requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 

expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our operations internationally including by directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition as a result of our expanding global operations we may become subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities these may include laws rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business to date we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets we may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

our business is subject to risks related to our real estate holdings 

revenue from our real estate operations represented about 1 of our operating revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 lower occupancy rates market rental rates and nonrenewal of leases by tenants could have a material adverse effect on revenue from building operations any decrease in leased space could also affect future building service revenue if there is no corresponding demand for the vacated office space furthermore most of our tenants are engaged in businesses that are directly or indirectly related to the brokeragetrading industry or related areas of financial services and adverse business conditions affecting those businesses could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy rates and building services revenues 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we rely primarily on trade secret copyright service mark trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights we have filed several patent applications covering our technology in the united states and certain other jurisdictions notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights we also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law we have copyright registrations for certain of our software user manuals and databases the copyright protection afforded to databases however is fairly limited 

  

while the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable the actual data may not be and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function in some cases including a number of our most important products there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and electronic execution services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

risks relating to the merger with cbot holdings 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our merger with cbot holdings 

on july 12 2007 cme holdings completed its merger with cbot holdings and cbot holdings was merged with and into cme holdings the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits from combining the businesses of cme holdings and cbot holdings we expect cme group to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale market integration and more automation we expect annual expense savings of more than 100 million in 2008 however to realize these anticipated benefits we must successfully combine the businesses of cme holdings and cbot holdings if we are not able to achieve these objectives the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction in the amounts and times projected for a number of reasons including that the integration may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated 

  

the failure to integrate successfully the businesses and operations of cme holdings and cbot holdings in the expected time frame may adversely affect cme group’s future results 

prior to the completion of the merger cme holdings and cbot holdings historically operated as independent companies the management of cme group may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of cme holdings and cbot holdings and their subsidiaries integrating their technologies organizations procedures policies and operations as well as addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel our remaining integration efforts include the consolidation of the two trading floors the consolidation of market data services and the consolidation of certain regulatory functions the integration process is complex and time consuming and requires substantial resources and effort the integration process and other disruptions resulting from the merger may also disrupt our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with members of cme and cbot and other market participants employees regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings in addition difficulties in integrating the businesses or regulatory functions of cme holdings and cbot holdings could harm the reputation of cme group 

we have incurred costs in connection with the merger and will continue to incur costs in connection with the merger 

cme holdings and cbot holdings have incurred significant costs associated with transaction fees professional services and other costs related to the merger and cme group will continue to incur additional costs including restructuring costs in connection with the integration of the business specifically through december 31 2007 cme holdings and cbot holdings have incurred approximately 1143 million for costs related to their merger although cme group expects that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction mergerrelated and restructuring costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

we may incur significant indebtedness in order to finance the guarantee of the chicago board options exchange exercise right privileges which may limit our operating flexibility and we may not realize the value of the exercise right privileges we purchased 

on september 26 2007 we purchased 159 cboe exercise right privileges erps from cbot members at december 31 2007 these acquired erps totaled 366 million and were recorded in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets additionally eligible holders of erps are entitled to a maximum guaranteed payment from us of 250000 upon resolution of the lawsuit between cbot and cboe in connection with this guarantee we have recorded a liability of 140 million related to the fair value of the guarantee obligation which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the value of the outstanding guarantee and the value of the erps we acquired will continue to be adjusted on a quarterly basis until the lawsuit is resolved to the extent the lawsuit results in no recovery our obligation under the guarantee would be 2930 million which would require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash on hand or incur additional indebtedness additionally in such event we would be required to write off the erps owned by us

references in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to cme group and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively references to our “exchange” are to chicago mercantile exchange inc cme board of trade of the city of chicago inc cbot and their subsidiaries collectively 

overview 

business structure 

cme group a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for cme cbot and their subsidiaries the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme group’s class a common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq global select market under the ticker symbol “cme” 

cme and cbot are designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities futures contracts are legally binding standardized agreements to buy or sell a financial instrument or commodity specifying quantity and quality at a set price on a future date certain futures contracts such as commodities and foreign exchange products may result in physical delivery of the product traded other futures contracts including those for equity index and interest rate products are cash settled and do not involve physical delivery to provide additional flexibility to the investment community we also offer trading in options on futures contracts these contracts offer the customer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying futures contract at a particular price by a particular time 

we are a global exchange with customer access available all over the world our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

  

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities and alternative investments our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

our major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platforms and our open outcry trading floors these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency as of january 2008 all products with the exception of cbot metals products are traded on the cme globex platform cbot metals products continue to be traded on the ecbot platform we plan to consolidate our trading floors in the second quarter of 2008 

in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house we also offer trading in medium and longterm interest rate swaps denominated in euros swiss francs pounds sterling and us dollars which are traded on the swapstream platform 

our clearing house clears settles and guarantees every futures and options contract traded through our exchange ownership and control of our own clearing house enables us to capture the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products ownership also enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development technology market regulation and risk management activities 

our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies 

to ensure performance of counterparties we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms and marktomarket their positions at least twice a day we also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation these assets include security deposits performance bonds and any other available assets such as the proceeds from the sale of pledged class a and class b common stock and associated trading rights of the clearing firm at our exchange that are owned by or assigned to the clearing firm in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of a clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use in order cme’s surplus funds security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit 

industry trends 

derivatives exchanges that provide markets for futures and options have become a global growth industry with a compound annual growth rate of 36 from 2002 through june 2007 based on notional value by comparison the overthecounter derivatives market has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 35 during the same period there are a number of trends that we believe will continue to drive growth and innovation in our industry they include 

 

  

  

  

   

changing market dynamics also have led to increasing competition in all aspects of our business from both domestic and international sources we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges overthecounter markets and clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities and technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers 

we expect competition to continue to intensify particularly as a result of technological advances and reductions in the regulatory requirements for the development of products and markets that are competitive with our own additional factors that may intensify competition in the future include 

 

  

  

  

 strategy 

our current strategy specifically focuses on leveraging our benchmark products scalable infrastructure and clearing and trade matching technologies to benefit customers this strategy will enable us to continue to evolve into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that offers trading and clearing solutions across additional products and asset classes our strategy includes coordinated efforts to 

 

  

  

  

  

 primary sources of operating revenue 

clearing and transaction fees a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include electronic trading fees surcharges for privatelynegotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for contracts executed through our trading venues because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with volume changes in addition to the trends noted earlier our revenues and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty this is because our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from uncertainty in addition our volume can be seasonal and historically we have experienced higher sequential volume during the first and second quarters followed by decreases in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year however these patterns may be altered by the impact of economic and political events the launch of new products mergers and acquisitions as well as other factors 

while volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue 

 

  

  

  

   

rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we may periodically change fees volume discounts limits on fees and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

as a result of their rate structure total return asset contracts trakrs swapstream products and auctiontraded products are excluded from disclosures of trading volume and average rate per contract in this discussion and analysis clearing and transaction fees on these products are immaterial relative to our other products trakrs are exchangetraded nontraditional futures contracts that trade electronically on the cme globex electronic platform swapstream offers interest rate swap products through its interdealer electronic trading platform auctiontraded products which included cme economic derivatives were previously traded on the cme auction markets platform through july 2007 

product mix we offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities and alternative investments rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and support introduction of new products to encourage trading volume 

trading venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading platforms as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions any customer guaranteed by a clearing firm is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers executing trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platform in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on all transactions 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

quotation data fees we receive quotation data fees from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers our market data services are provided primarily through thirdparty distributors 

subscribers can obtain access to realtime delayed and endofday quotation trade and summary market data for our products users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is also a flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our quotation data fees revenue is influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data fees 

processing services to further diversify the range of services we offer we have entered into clearing and transaction processing agreements with other exchanges this revenue will fluctuate as the trading volume of these exchanges fluctuates 

this revenue includes fees for listing energy and metal futures products on the cme globex platform for the new york mercantile exchange nymex although trading under a prior agreement with nymex ended in november 2005 trading under a new 10year agreement began in june 2006 additionally in 2007 we began providing clearing and risk management services for trades executed at fxmarketspace limited fxms our joint venture with reuters group plc reuters which offers centrallycleared overthecounter trading of foreign exchange spot contracts we also collect fees for processing trades for certain cme clearing firms that execute trades at onechicago llc onechicago our joint venture in single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes 

  

our agreement with cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot products was terminated upon consummation of the merger processing services revenue includes fees from this agreement in 2005 2006 and for the period january 1 through july 12 2007 

other sources other sources of revenue include access and communication fees and revenue from various services related to our operations 

access and communication fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the cme globex and ecbot platforms to our market data vendors and to direct market data customers as well as charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers revenue from communication fees is largely dependent on open outcry trading as a significant portion relates to telecommunications on our trading floors 

other revenues include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants as part of our merger with cbot holdings we acquired three buildings with over 15 million square feet of commercial space in chicago’s central business district the retail and office space is rented primarily to third party tenants including company shareholders and exchange customers all tenants pay market rates for rent the majority of tenant leases have terms of three to five years with larger tenants having leases for up to nineteen years these revenues are generally affected by market rental rates lease renewals and business conditions in the financial services industry in which most of our tenants operate 

other revenues also includes fees for administering our interest earning facility ief program trade order routing and various services to members and clearing firms we offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various ief offerings these clearing firms receive interest income and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit in addition other revenues includes trading gains and losses generated by gfx corporation gfx our whollyowned subsidiary that trades primarily in foreign exchange futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products 

primary operating expenses 

with the exception of license fees paid for the trading of our equity index contracts and a component of our trading facility rent that is related to open outcry trading volume most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force which includes a growing percentage of technologyrelated employees the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plan the bonus funded under the plan would be the “target” level if we achieve the cash earnings target established by the compensation committee of our board of directors cash earnings are defined as net income excluding taxeffected amortization of purchased intangibles depreciation and amortization expense and taxeffected stockbased compensation expense less capital expenditures under the plan if our actual cash earnings equal 80 of the established target for a given year the bonus will be reduced by approximately 50 of the target bonus amount there will be no bonus if our cash earnings are less than 80 of the cash earnings target other than for nonexempt employees who may receive a bonus under our discretionary bonus program if our actual cash earnings equal 120 of the target or higher the bonus would be increased by approximately 50 from the targeted bonus amount which is the maximum amount established by the compensation committee if our performance is between the threshold performance level of 80 of the cash earnings target and the maximum performance level of 120 of the cash earnings target the bonus will be calculated based on the level of performance achieved the compensation committee may adjust the cash earnings calculation and the target level of performance for material unplanned revenue expense or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities beginning in 2007 the cash earnings calculation for bonus purposes excludes investment income and interest expense as well as expense resulting from the guarantee of the chicago board options exchange inc cboe exercise right privileges targeted cash levels have been adjusted accordingly for these changes in the cash earnings calculation 

  

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to stock options and restricted stock grants effective january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r requires the use of the fair value method of accounting for sharebased payments which we previously adopted in 2002 under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas no 123r also requires that we estimate expected forfeitures of stock grants instead of the previous practice of accounting for forfeitures as they occurred stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of options granted fair value is derived using the blackscholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility the riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options granted 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of longlived assets purchased as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software this expense has increased consistently from year to year due to significant technology investments in equipment and software depreciable useful lives have remained relatively consistent since january 1 2004 as a result of our merger with cbot holdings we acquired three commercial buildings we utilize space in these buildings as offices and a trading floor depreciation and amortization on the building and building improvements as well as other furniture fixtures and equipment acquired in the merger has been recorded since the merger closed on july 12 2007 

other expenses we incur additional ongoing expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 nonoperating income and expense 

nonoperating income and expense includes investment income securities lending interest income and expense interest expense expense related to the guarantee of exercise right privileges and equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries 

 

  

  

  

  

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition income taxes internal use software costs and stockbased compensation 

goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the provisions of sfas no 142 require that a twostep impairment test be performed on goodwill in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 

  

intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicated by a change in circumstances pursuant to sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value the estimate of the fair value of all intangible assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows in estimating the fair value management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows future revenues future earnings and other factors such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 

revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies comply with staff accounting bulletin no 101 on revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customer’s exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests occasionally market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment when these circumstances occur revenue is recognized as services are provided 

income taxes calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years as determined in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” and financial interpretation fin no 48 “accounting for uncertain tax positions” as required our deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if all assets will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable tax jurisdictions using a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes to tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax such as municipal interest income and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” costs capitalized are for application development or implementation as required by sop 981 for software projects that will result in significant new functionality and that are generally expected to cost in excess of 05 million the amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible softwarerelated activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria of sop 981 and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project completed internal use software projects as well as workinprogress projects are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets once completed the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software generally three years costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from year to year based on our technologyrelated business requirements 

  

stockbased compensation we expense stock options using the fair value method under the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” we have elected the accelerated method for recognizing the expense related to stock grants due to this election and the vesting provisions of our stock grants a greater percentage of the total expense is recognized in the first and second years of the vesting period than would be recorded if we used the straightline method upon adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 we began to include an estimate of expected forfeitures of stock grants in our expense recognition calculations instead of the previous practice of accounting for forfeitures as they occurred 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities by defining fair value establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value measurements the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements but will require additional disclosures beginning in the first quarter of 2008 

the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities—including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” in february 2007 sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the impact of the adoption will be dependent on the extent to which we elect to measure eligible items at fair value we did not elect to measure any items at fair value upon our initial adoption of the standard 

sfas no 141r “business combinations” was issued in december 2007 to replace sfas no 141 “business combinations” sfas no 141r requires that an acquirer recognize the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date this new statement also changes the requirements for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies restructuring liabilities and acquisition costs the provisions of this statement are applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 we are currently assessing the impact of this standard’s future adoption on our financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas no 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements the provisions require consolidated net income to be reported at the total amount attributable to both the parent and noncontrolling interest with disclosure of the amount attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest on the face of the statement of income the statement also requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and is applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is initially applied we are currently assessing the impact of this standard’s future adoption on our financial statements 

results of operations for 2007 compared with 2006 

2007 financial highlights 

the comparability of our operating results for 2007 compared with 2006 is significantly impacted by our merger with cbot holdings in our discussion and analysis of comparative periods we have quantified the contribution of additional revenue or expense resulting from the merger wherever such amounts were material and identifiable while identified amounts may provide indications of general trends the analysis cannot completely address the effects attributable to integration efforts 

 

  

   

 during the third quarter of 2007 we began the process of restructuring our staffing technology and facilities as a result of the merger at that time we began incurring restructuring charges and will continue to incur additional expense in 2008 

 

  

  

 operating revenues 

 

 clearing and transaction fees revenue increased primarily due to growth in trading volume partially offset by a decrease in average rate per contract 

volume 

the addition of the cbot product line contributed significantly to an increase in overall trading volume during 2007 we also believe that a significant increase in volatility generated in part from uncertainty surrounding the subprime debt market during 2007 added to an increase in volume across all product lines 

  

the following table summarizes average daily trading volume for comparative purposes cme and cbot products have been presented separately and average daily volume for cbot products has been calculated for the period from july 13 2007 through december 31 2007 all amounts exclude trakrs swapstream and auctiontraded products 

 

  

 interest rate products 

the increase in interest rate trading volume is due primarily to the addition of cbot interest rate products subsequent to the merger cbot interest rate products volume is attributable primarily to 10year and 5year us treasury note futures and options which had average daily volume of 17 million and 08 million contracts respectively from july 13 2007 through the end of the year average daily volume for 10year and 5year us treasury note futures and options was 13 million and 05 million contracts respectively for the last six months of 2006 cbot product volume for 2006 is provided for comparative purposes only and does not relate to revenues recognized by cme group overall trading volume growth in interest rate products also resulted from uncertainty surrounding inflation and market interest rates as well as concerns about the subprime debt market which generated additional market volatility cme eurodollar futures traded electronically increased to an average of 22 million contracts per day in 2007 an increase of 30 when compared with 2006 additionally volume for cme eurodollar options traded via open outcry increased 14 to an average of 11 million contracts per day in 2007 

equity products 

trading volume for equity products increased for the year due primarily to a sharp rise in volatility in the equity markets resulting from subprime debt market and inflationary concerns especially during the second half of 2007 average volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index increased by 77 in the last six months of 2007 compared with the same period in 2006 

average daily volume of our emini equity products increased by 50 to 24 million contracts in 2007 compared with 2006 this included an increase in average daily volume for emini sp 500 futures and options contracts of 60 to 17 million contracts in 2007 

as announced in june 2007 our license to list russellbased contracts will terminate in september 2008 when the last contracts currently traded expire average daily volume for the russellbased contracts was 252000 for 2007 on june 19 2007 we launched new emini sp small cap futures and options contracts based on the sp 600 index to offer a comparable alternative to the russellbased contracts 

in august 2007 we renewed our licensing agreement with dow jones the agreement enables us to continue to exclusively offer futures and options on futures products based on the dow jones industrial average djia and other dow jones indexes the new agreement is effective january 1 2008 through december 31 2014 and also includes a provision for a fiveyear renewal term and successive annual renewal terms thereafter 

foreign exchange products 

the increase in trading of foreign exchange products was fueled in part by the decline of the us dollar relative to other major currencies we believe that market reactions to events in the fixed income market also contributed to volume growth during the year in 2007 92 of our foreign exchange volume traded electronically compared with 88 during 2006 

commodities and alternative investments 

trading volume growth during 2007 resulted primarily from the additional volume generated from cbot commodities subsequent to the merger cbot commodities consist primarily of corn and soybean futures and options 

  

average rate per contract 

the increase in average daily volume in 2007 was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate or revenue per contract all amounts in the following table exclude trakrs swapstream and auctiontraded products 

 

 the average rate per contract decreased in 2007 due primarily to growth in member trading when compared with 2006 member trading volume increased faster than nonmember trading in 2007 we believe that higher volumes by automated trading systems which typically receive member rates contributed to this increase in member trading in addition the average rate per contract of the emini sp 500 futures and options contracts decreased due to incremental volume reaching the cme globex surcharge cap resulting in a decrease in the overall average rate per contract 

the decrease in average rate per contract was partially offset by the addition of cbot products to our existing product lines the average rate per contract for cbot products was 0657 for the period july 13 through december 31 2007 the increase in average rate per contract is attributable primarily to an increase in commodities volume which has a higher average rate per contract during the fourth quarter of 2007 additionally the percentage of total volume by product line shifted during the year from cme interest rate products to emini equity products which have a higher rate per contract as a percentage of total volume emini equity volume increased by 5 in 2007 when compared with 2006 while interest rate product volume decreased by 4 

concentration of revenue 

we bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers we currently have approximately 120 clearing firms the increase in the number of clearing firms compared with the prior year is due to the addition of cbotonly clearing firms as a result of our merger one firm represented approximately 11 of our clearing and transaction fee revenue for 2007 should a clearing firm discontinue operations we believe the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe this concentration exposes us to significant risk from the loss of revenue earned from the particular firm 

quotation data fees quotation data fees revenue increased mostly due to additional revenue of approximately 441 million contributed by market data services provided to existing cbot customers subsequent to the merger 

in addition a fee increase in cme market data fees on january 1 2007 also contributed to growth in revenue users of cme’s basic service paid 50 per month in 2007 for each market data screen or device compared with 40 per month in 2006 the higher rate combined with increases in other quotation data services contributed to additional revenue of 192 million in 2007 compared with 2006 

effective january 1 2008 all users of our basic services will pay 55 per month for each market data screen or device 

the two largest resellers of our market data generated approximately 67 of our quotation data fees revenue in 2007 however we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal despite this concentration in the event one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data we believe the majority of that vendor’s customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller 

  

processing services the increase in revenues is attributable primarily to an increase in nymex volume revenues generated from trade matching services provided to nymex which began at the end of the second quarter of 2006 increased by 421 million in 2007 when compared with 2006 the total volume of nymex products available on the cme globex platform increased to 1915 million contracts in 2007 from 356 million contracts in 2006 

this increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue resulting from the elimination of fees generated by the clearing agreement with cbot which terminated as a result of our merger with cbot holdings the decrease in processing services revenue resulting from this termination was 276 million in 2007 when compared with 2006 

access and communication fees the telecommunications services provided to cbot customers as well as connectivity charges for the ecbot trading platform contributed incremental revenue of approximately 48 million in 2007 in addition revenue growth in 2007 was also attributable to customers upgrading to higher bandwidth connections and expansion of our server colocation program the colocation program allows customers to connect their trading applications directly to the cme globex electronic platform by housing certain customer systems in a cmespecified data facility 

other revenues rental income and associated revenues from building operations acquired as a result of the merger with cbot holdings totaled 112 million in 2007 other incremental revenues from cbot totaled 23 million additionally the increase in other revenues is also attributable to a 26 million increase in gfx trading gains in 2007 when compared with 2006 

operating expenses 

 

  

 compensation and benefits the increase in compensation and benefits expense during 2007 compared with 2006 consisted primarily of the following 

 

  

  

  

   

subsequent to our merger we approved and initiated a plan to close duplicate facilities and reduce our workforce in order to improve operating efficiencies in addition to the positions we have eliminated through december 2007 we expect to eliminate approximately 200 positions by june 2008 we expect these reductions to contribute to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense relative to the current period 

communications this expense increased primarily as a result of our merger with cbot holdings costs incurred to support ecbot operations and customer connectivity resulted in incremental expense in 2007 continued growth in existing customer and data center connections and bandwidth upgrades also contributed to the increase in expense in 2007 

technology support services there was an increase of approximately 151 million due primarily to the integration and support of the ecbot electronic trading platform in 2007 additional investments in technology including an upgrade to our network and mainframe system in 2006 led to increased ongoing maintenance costs as part of a planned system expansion to increase capacity for peak volumes of transactions processed electronically 

professional fees and outside services technologyrelated and other professional fees net of amounts capitalized for internally developed software increased by 112 million in 2007 compared with 2006 the increase was due primarily to consulting services used to supplement our merger integration efforts as well as noncapitalizable software development costs and expenses incurred to support our strategic initiatives 

additionally legal fees increased 63 million in 2007 due to litigation costs related to the lampers and cboe proceedings resulting from our merger with cbot holdings as well as the ongoing antitrust suit filed by eurex us 

in total this expense category includes 89 million in mergerrelated costs in 2007 

amortization of purchased intangibles the increase in expense during 2007 is attributable to intangible assets obtained in our merger with cbot holdings intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm relationships market data customer relationships the dow jones licensing agreement and leaserelated intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles in 2006 relates to intangible assets obtained as a result of our business acquisition of swapstream and our acquisition of assets from liquidity direct technology llc 

depreciation and amortization the increase in expense is related primarily to additional assets obtained in our recent merger with cbot holdings depreciation and amortization expense attributable to the addition of these assets was estimated as 186 million in 2007 this amount includes the impact of purchase accounting valuation adjustments in addition we have shortened the useful lives of various technologyrelated and trading floor assets due to our plans to consolidate some electronic trading systems and trading floor operations this resulted in incremental expense of 79 million in 2007 we expect this acceleration of depreciation to result in 80 million of expense in 2008 in addition depreciation and amortization of 2007 and 2006 property additions exceeded the depreciation and amortization of assets that have become fully depreciated or retired since january 1 2006 contributing to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2007 

property additions excluding mergerrelated additions for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below technologyrelated assets include purchases of computers and related equipment software the cost of developing internal use software and the buildout of our data centers while total property additions increased in 2007 technologyrelated spending decreased as a percentage of total additions due to an increase in spending for the development of our newlyleased chicago office space 

 

 occupancy and building operations the addition of three commercial real estate properties as a result of our recent merger resulted in incremental expense of 84 million in 2007 relating primarily to utilities maintenance and real estate tax expense in addition we entered into two leases for additional office space in chicago and london during the third quarter of 2006 these new leases contributed to an increase of 102 million in rent utilities and real estate tax expense in 2007 

in august 2007 we renegotiated the leases for office space and trading floor facilities at our headquarters under the terms of our new lease which extends our occupancy through 2022 we will be reducing our rented space after november 2008 

  

licensing and other fee agreements higher trading volume for licensed products particularly emini sp products resulted in 88 million of additional expense in 2007 also contributing to an increase in this expense were licensing and market maker fees of approximately 41 million resulting from our recent merger with cbot holdings these increases were partially offset by a 27 million reduction in costs incurred under a fee sharing arrangement with sgx which ceased in february 2007 under the terms of our renewed agreement 

we renewed our exclusive product licensing agreement with dow jones in september 2007 the new agreement is effective from january 2008 through december 2014 and includes an upfront payment as well as minimum annual payments the upfront payment which was negotiated in exchange for a reduced rate per contract will be recognized in equal amounts each month over the term of the agreement 

restructuring this expense consists primarily of severance to transitional cbot employees severance to cme employees retention bonuses and associated payroll taxes as well as outplacement costs and postemployment healthcare subsidies approximately 35 million of additional restructuring expense will be incurred in 2008 

other expense the increase in expense for 2007 is attributable primarily to 80 million of marketing advertising and public relations costs incurred as part of our global brand campaign and efforts to redesign and expand our customer education programs included in the 80 million increase for 2007 was 39 million of mergerrelated rebranding and print advertising costs also contributing to the increase in other expense for the year was 63 million of settlement costs related to the lampers class action lawsuit finally a higher level of operating expenses associated with the combined company resulted in an increase in this expense for the year 

nonoperating income and expense 

 

  

 investment income the increase in investment income in 2007 when compared with 2006 is attributable primarily to the investment of additional cash generated from operations during the year as well as rising shortterm interest rates in late 2007 cash was utilized for a share repurchase and interest rates began to decline resulting in a decline in the investment income growth rate we had experienced earlier in the year funds from maturing investments have been reinvested in liquid shortterm investments due to the uncertainty surrounding longterm interest rates and to provide flexibility in pursuing strategic opportunities 

annualized average rates of return and average investment balances indicated in the table below include shortterm investments classified as cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and a portion of clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits but exclude the impact of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan and insurance contracts we exclude the impact of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan from this analysis because earnings from the plan are offset by an equal amount of expense in compensation and benefits expense 

 

 securities lending during 2007 we expanded lending relationships to include additional banks which led to an increase in the number of eligible securities available for lending beginning in late august 2007 we temporarily suspended our securities lending program due to high volatility in the credit markets and extreme market demand for us treasury securities resulting in a decline of 

  

the revenue and expense growth rate we had experienced earlier in the year we resumed the program in midseptember once market volatility subsided despite the temporary suspension of the program in 2007 the expansion of lending relationships resulted in an increase in the average daily balance of funds invested when compared with 2006 the spread between the average rate earned and the average rate paid increased during 2007 due to the combined effect of changes in the federal discount rate which correlates closely with the interest expense and an increase in market demand for the securities we had available to lend through this program 

 

 interest expense in september 2007 we initiated a commercial paper program with various institutions under which we may issue and sell unsecured shortterm promissory notes during 2007 we issued 12 billion in par value of commercial paper notes at december 31 2007 1644 million of debt remained outstanding the weighted average balance of notes outstanding for the full year was 642 million interest rates on notes issued ranged from 450 to 538 

guarantee of exercise right privileges under the terms of the merger with cbot holdings eligible holders of cboe erps had until august 24 2007 to elect to sell us their erps for 250000 per privilege upon resolution of the lawsuit between cbot and cboe qualified holders that did not elect to sell are entitled to a maximum guaranteed payment of 250000 per privilege if the value received by the erp holder upon resolution of the lawsuit is less than 250000 we will pay the difference 

we recorded expense equal to the estimated fair value of the guarantee on 1331 erps outstanding at the close of the merger in august 2007 159 erps were tendered for sale to us we have reflected changes in the estimated fair value of the guarantee on the erps that remain outstanding and adjusted our expense accordingly we will continue to recognize changes in the fair value of the outstanding guarantee as income or expense on a quarterly basis until the lawsuit is resolved 

subsequent to the tendering of these rights the maximum potential aggregate payment to the remaining holders under the guarantee is 2930 million 

equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries the increase resulted primarily from incremental losses of 71 million from our investment in fxms for 2007 fxms our joint venture with reuters was established in the second half of 2006 and began operations in february 2007 

income tax provision 

the effective tax rate increased to 399 in 2007 from 394 in 2006 the increase was due primarily to the inability to recognize the benefit of the net operating losses generated by our swapstream operations which we acquired in august 2006 the valuation allowance recorded against swapstream’s accumulated net operating losses will not be derecognized until there is a pattern of operating income from these operations the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by an increase in taxadvantaged securities 

results of operations for 2006 compared with 2005 

2006 financial highlights 

 

  

  

  

   

 operating revenues 

 

 clearing and transaction fees the increase was due to trading volume growth partially offset by a decrease in the average rate per contract 

volume 

in 2006 our volume surpassed one billion contracts traded for the second consecutive year driven by growth of 25 or more in all product lines technology enhancements including the migration of our cme globex trading platform to new hewlett packard integrity nonstop servers that incorporate intel itanium processors significantly increased tradematching speed which reduced our average response time on transactions and resulted in increased usage by automated trading systems growth in hedge funds interest rate uncertainty and occasional daily volatility in equity markets also contributed to trading volume growth 

the following table summarizes average daily trading volume all amounts exclude trakrs swapstream and auctiontraded products 

 

 interest rate products 

interest rate product volume increased in 2006 due primarily to uncertain market expectations surrounding interest rates including those created by changes in federal reserve monetary policy expansion in the use of our electronic trading platform as a result of technological enhancement and increased use of automated trading systems the volume of interest rate products traded electronically increased by 34 to 18 million contracts per day in 2006 trends favoring the trading of derivative products also contributed to the increase in volume 

the average daily volume of cme eurodollar options which are traded predominantly through open outcry increased by 44 to 11 million contracts in 2006 in conjunction with the increase in eurodollar options volume the average daily volume of cme eurodollar options traded electronically also increased to 77000 contracts in 2006 from 28000 contracts in 2005 in april 2006 we launched a new incentive program to increase electronic trading of cme eurodollar options the program which was initially effective through december 2006 was extended through june 2007 the program provided a reduced fee schedule for customers meeting percentage thresholds for electronic trading of cme eurodollar options 

  

equity products 

the increase in equity product volume for the year was due primarily to technological enhancements increased usage of equity option products occasional significant daily fluctuations in stock market volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index and efforts to attract new customers 

average daily volume of our emini equity products increased by 25 to 16 million contracts in 2006 compared with 2005 in particular emini sp 500 volume increased 27 to 11 million contracts volume for our electronically traded emini equity options increased to 45000 contracts per day in 2006 from 18000 contracts per day in 2005 

foreign exchange products 

in december 2006 foreign exchange volume set a monthly volume record with 621000 contracts traded per day the increase in trading of foreign exchange products resulted from the previously mentioned technological enhancements which facilitated faster execution of trades additional liquidity and fee incentive programs including those specifically targeted to attract commodity trading advisors and large hedge funds in 2006 88 of our foreign exchange volume traded through the cme globex platform compared with 81 during 2005 

commodity and alternative investment products 

trading in commodity and alternative investment products increased as a result of the growing appeal of commodities as an asset class which has attracted additional trading activity in live cattle and lean hog products 

average rate per contract 

the impact of the 28 increase in average daily trading volume during 2006 was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate or revenue per contract all amounts in the following table exclude trakrs swapstream and auctiontraded products 

 

 in 2006 the average rate per contract decreased when compared with 2005 due primarily to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 these decreases were partially offset by broadbased pricing increases implemented in august 2005 which contributed incremental revenue of approximately 130 million when compared with 2005 additionally the rate per contract was favorably impacted by a higher percentage of trades executed through the cme globex platform for which additional fees are assessed 

quotation data fees the growth in revenue resulted primarily from a fee increase that was implemented on january 1 2006 users of our basic service paid 40 per month for each market data screen or device in 2006 the monthly charge in effect during 2005 was 35 this higher rate contributed to a 104 million increase in subscriber fees for 2006 compared with 2005 and was partially offset by a 15 million decrease in assessments which result from our periodic audits of usage data previously provided by our customers 

  

processing services revenue increased primarily as a result of increased trading volume at cbot and higher volume executed on the cme globex platform under our agreement with nymex cbot’s average daily trading volume was 32 million contracts for 2006 an increase of 20 over the 27 million contracts traded in 2005 this increased volume at cbot generated incremental revenue of 116 million in 2006 revenue from services provided to nymex increased by 98 million in 2006 when compared with 2005 our prior agreement with nymex ended in november 2005 trading under our new 10year agreement began in june 2006 the new agreement added metals futures products and expanded the number of energy futures products including the addition of physically delivered wti futures products which we now list for nymex on the cme globex platform as a result the average daily volume of nymex electronic trading increased significantly on our platform during 2006 

access fees growth in revenue resulted from the expiration in july 2006 of an incentive program to encourage our customers to switch to a higher bandwidth connection 

operating expenses 

 

 compensation and benefits the increase in compensation and benefits expense during 2006 relative to 2005 consisted primarily of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 technology support services we experienced growth of 20 in the average number of transactions processed electronically during 2006 when compared with 2005 as a result of the continued growth in transactions processed additional maintenance and service contracts were required to support increases in hardware and software purchases 

  

professional fees and outside services legal fees increased 41 million in 2006 when compared with 2005 due primarily to the structuring and establishment of fxms and litigation costs related to the ongoing antitrust lawsuit filed by eurex us in 2003 

in addition other professional fees increased 34 million in 2006 due primarily to the use of consulting services to support several clearing and trading systems projects as well as enhancements to the cme globex platform’s functionality including the ability to execute complex options trading strategies during the fourth quarter mergerrelated integration planning also contributed to an increase in professional fees 

depreciation and amortization during the second quarter of 2006 we began an 18month process of migrating the electronic trading of products to new hewlett packard integrity nonstop servers that incorporate intel itanium processors as a result of the migration we reassessed and shortened the estimated useful lives on our existing processors which resulted in additional depreciation expense of 19 million in 2006 when compared with 2005 in addition depreciation and amortization of 2005 and 2006 property additions exceeded the depreciation and amortization of assets that have become fully depreciated or retired since january 1 2005 resulting in an increase in 2006 depreciation and amortization expense 

property additions for 2006 and 2005 are summarized below technologyrelated assets include purchases of computers and related equipment software the cost of developing internal use software and costs associated with the expansion of our data centers 

 

 occupancy and building operations we entered into two new leases for additional space in chicago and london during 2006 the chicago lease which began in august 2006 provides us with an opportunity to reorganize and maximize the utilization of our facilities in the downtown area the london lease which began in november 2006 allowed us to consolidate our existing london office with swapstream’s facilities the new leases resulted in additional rent expense of 11 million in 2006 

licensing and other fee agreements a large portion of the increase in this expense was attributable to an increase in licensing rates for sp emini products and to a lesser extent nasdaq emini products rate increases went into effect in june 2005 for nasdaq products and september 2005 for sp products in return for extending our exclusive rights to offer these products renegotiated licensing rates resulted in 65 million of incremental expense compared with 2005 also higher average daily trading volume for licensed products resulted in additional expense of 24 million in 2006 higher volumes were attributable primarily to emini products based on the sp 500 and nasdaq100 

these increases in expense were partially offset by a 09 million decrease in fees paid to market maker program participants the reduction in market maker fees was due primarily to the expiration of the russell 1000 program in december 2005 

other expense in 2006 this expense increased primarily as a result of the preparation for and launch of a new global brand advertising campaign the promotion of new products and production of cme’s quarterly magazine which launched in the third quarter of 2005 also contributed to an increase in expense 

nonoperating income and expense 

 

 investment income rising market interest rates as well as increased funds available for investment resulted in increased investment income in 2006 when compared with 2005 increases in investment income were partially offset by an increase in taxadvantaged investments as a percentage of the total portfolio during 2006 the annualized average rate of return and average investment balance 

  

indicated in the table below include shortterm investments classified as cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits but exclude the first iefs and our nonqualified deferred compensation plan nonqualified deferred compensation plan earnings are excluded from this analysis as there is an equal and offsetting amount in compensation and benefits expense 

 

 increases due to rate and balance changes were partially offset by a decrease of 19 million resulting from the discontinuance of our investment in the first iefs as of december 2005 

securities lending interest income and expense the average daily balance of funds available for lending increased during 2006 relative to 2005 this was primarily the result of a policy change effective october 1 2005 that increased the amount of securities available for lending to 70 from 50 of total eligible securities 

 

 equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries this includes 61 million of losses from our investment in fxms which was formed in july 2006 as well as our proportionate share of losses from onechicago 

income tax provision 

in 2006 the effective tax rate decreased from 396 to 394 when compared with 2005 the decrease is due primarily to increased investments in taxadvantaged securities the impact of which was partially offset by the nondeductibility of net operating losses generated by our swapstream operations subsequent to our acquisition of this business in august 2006 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

historically we have met our operational funding requirements with cash generated by operations if operations do not provide sufficient funds to meet shortterm and longterm capital expenditure requirements cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities can be reduced to provide the needed funds assets can be acquired through capital leases or we can borrow using public or private debt facilities in addition we believe we can fund any pending or potential future acquisitions with internally available cash debt financing or the issuance of equity securities 

on february 26 2008 we completed our transaction with brazilian mercantile  futures exchange sa bmf we issued 12 million shares of class a common stock approximately a 2 equity interest in the company in exchange for 1011 million shares of bmf an equity interest of approximately 10 neither cme group nor bmf may sell its equity interest in the other until february 2012 under the provisions of the agreement our investment in bmf is recorded at a cost of 6314 million based on our stock price of 53100 at close on february 25 2008 

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancelable purchase obligations as well as commitments reflected as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2007 these commitments are as follows in thousands 

 

  

   

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through investment in increased system capacity and performance and through technological initiatives on our electronic trading platforms each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our trading floor facilities offices remote data centers telecommunications capabilities and other operating equipment we expect 2008 capital expenditures to total between 2250 million and 2350 million excluding leasehold improvements for our new office space that will be funded with landlord allowances anticipated capital expenditures for 2008 include approximately 770 million of data center buildout costs related primarily to our new data center 

we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders the decision to pay a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements level of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant in 2007 our annual dividend target remained at approximately 30 of the prior year’s cash earnings for 2008 our annual dividend target will remain at approximately 30 of 2007 cash earnings calculated as if the merger with cbot holdings had occurred on january 1 2007 on january 30 2008 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 115 per share payable on march 25 2008 to shareholders of record on march 10 2008 assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding other than the issuance of 12 million shares to bmf the march 2008 dividend payment will total approximately 626 million 

sources and uses of cash 

net cash provided by operating activities was 8144 million in 2007 compared with 4717 million in 2006 net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to the increase in net income during 2007 in 2007 net cash provided by operating activities was 1558 million higher than net income adjustments to net income consisted primarily of 1057 million in depreciation and amortization 339 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and a 312 million increase in other current liabilities partially offset by a 506 million increase in deferred income taxes and a 499 million increase in accounts receivable the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due primarily to additional assets obtained in our recent merger with cbot holdings accounts receivable in any period result primarily from the clearing and transaction fees billed in the last month of the reporting period 

cash used in investing activities was 786 million in 2007 compared with 859 million in 2006 the decrease in cash used compared with 2006 was due primarily to 1160 million of cash acquired in our merger with cbot holdings and a 307 million increase in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities net of purchases these increases in cash were partially offset by a 758 million increase in property and equipment purchases 398 million used to purchase exercise right privileges and an increase of 372 million in mergerrelated transaction costs 

cash used in financing activities was 8599 million in 2007 compared with 272 million for 2006 the increase in cash used was due primarily to 9493 million paid to repurchase common stock and a 640 million increase in cash dividends to shareholders this increase in cash used was partially offset by proceeds of debt issuances net of maturities and debt issuance costs of 1629 million 

debt instruments 

we maintain a 364day revolving loan facility with various financial institutions which provides for loans of up to 7500 million this revolving loan facility serves as a backup facility for our commercial paper program proceeds from the program were used to partially fund our recent tender offer stock repurchase and related fees on september 5 2007 we purchased 17 million shares of our class a common stock at a purchase price of 560 per share for a total cost of approximately 9506 million including related fees and expenses under the terms of the facility proceeds can also be used to finance the bmf investment transaction and to pay general corporate purposes of up to 3000 million 

our clearing house maintains an 8000 million 364day line of credit with a consortium of banks to be used in certain situations the line of credit which was renewed on october 12 2007 continues to be collateralized by clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as security deposit funds in the interest earning facilities and any performance bond deposits of a clearing firm that has defaulted on its obligation the line of credit can only be drawn on to the extent it is collateralized security deposit collateral was 14 billion at december 31 2007 

  

to satisfy our performance bond obligations with sgx we pledge cmeowned us treasury securities in lieu of or in combination with irrevocable letters of credit at december 31 2007 the letters of credit totaled 1130 million in addition we had pledged securities with a fair value of 1001 million at december 31 2007 

cme also guarantees a 50 million standby letter of credit for gfx the beneficiary of the letter of credit is the clearing firm that is used by gfx to execute and maintain its futures positions the letter of credit will be utilized in the event gfx defaults in meeting performance bond requirements to its clearing firm 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2007 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the securities and exchange commission 

liquidity and cash management 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 8453 million at december 31 2007 compared with 9695 million at december 31 2006 the balance retained in cash and cash equivalents was a function of anticipated or possible shortterm cash needs prevailing interest rates our investment policy alternative investment choices and any dividends that we pay 

current net deferred tax assets of 184 million and 72 million are included in other current assets at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively current net deferred tax assets result primarily from stockbased compensation and restructuring liabilities at december 31 2006 noncurrent net deferred tax assets were 309 million consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization software development costs stockbased compensation and deferred compensation 

at december 31 2007 noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities were 38 billion net deferred tax liabilities are primarily the result of purchase accounting for intangible assets in our merger with cbot holdings noncurrent net deferred tax liabilities also include an 112 million deferred tax asset for acquired and accumulated net operating losses related to swapstream since swapstream has not yet developed a pattern of operating income our assessment at december 31 2007 is that we do not believe that we currently meet the morelikelythannot threshold that would allow us to realize the value of acquired and accumulated foreign net operating losses in the future as a result the deferred tax benefit arising from these net operating losses has been fully reserved 

each clearing firm is required to deposit and maintain a specified performance bond balance which is determined by parameters established by the risk management department of the clearing house and may fluctuate over time performance bond requirements can be satisfied with a variety of approved investments and cash cash performance bonds and security deposits are included in our consolidated balance sheets with the exception of the portion of securities deposited that are utilized in our securities lending program clearing firm deposits other than those retained in the form of cash are not included in our consolidated balance sheets securities lending transactions utilize a portion of the securities that clearing firms have deposited to satisfy their proprietary performance bond requirements securities lending activity fluctuates based on the amount of securities that clearing firms have deposited and the demand for securities lending activity in the particular securities available to us as a result of these factors the balances in cash performance bonds and security deposits as well as the balances in our securities lending program may fluctuate significantly over time 

cash performance bonds and security deposits and collateral from securities lending consisted of the following at december 31 

 

 we are required under the commodity exchange act to segregate cash and securities deposited by clearing firms on behalf of customers in addition our exchange rules require a segregation of all funds and securities deposited by clearing firms from exchange 

  

operating funds and marketable securities as with cash performance bonds and security deposits these balances will fluctuate due to the investment choices available to clearing firms and the change in total deposits required securities at fair value and ief funds were deposited for the following purposes at december 31 

 

 cash earnings 

cash earnings a nongaap measure is the primary metric used by us to measure our financial performance it is the basis for calculating dividends to shareholders it is calculated as net income plus depreciation and amortization expense excluding amortization of landlordfunded amounts plus taxeffected stockbased compensation plus taxeffected amortization of purchased intangibles less capital expenditures excluding landlordfunded amounts for 2008 our annual dividend target will be based on 2007 cash earnings calculated as if the merger with cbot holdings had occurred on january 1 2007 the cash earnings amount is calculated as follows 

 

  

 the cash earnings calculation with some modifications is also used as the basis for determining annual incentive payments to employees

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk our investment policy is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the investment of available funds investments typically include money market mutual funds municipal securities and us treasury and government agency securities with fixed or variable rate terms under our investment policy we monitor interest rate risk by completing regular reviews of our marketable securities portfolio and its sensitivity to changes in the general level of interest rates commonly referred to as a portfolio’s duration we control the duration of the portfolio primarily through the purchase of individual marketable securities having duration consistent with our overall investment policy in addition we will generally hold marketable securities to maturity which will act as a further mitigating factor to interest rate risk under our investment policy the aggregate portfolio duration cannot exceed 24 months 

a change in market interest rates would affect interest income as well as the fair value of investments all of our investments are carried at fair value for purposes of this analysis marketable securities exclude the investments of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan interest income from shortterm cash investments marketable securities and cash performance bonds and security deposits was 698 million and 538 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively our marketable securities portfolio experienced a net unrealized gain of 31 million in 2007 and a net unrealized gain of 21 million in 2006 there were no material realized gains or losses from sales of marketable securities in either period 

  

expected maturities and interest coupon rates for marketable securities all of which were fixedrate securities were as follows at december 31 2007 dollars in thousands 

 

 the 2008 expected maturities include 267 million in principal amount of zero coupon marketable securities excluding zero coupon securities the 2008 weighted average interest rate would be 361 

we maintain a 364day revolving loan facility of up to 7500 million with various financial institutions this loan facility serves as a backup facility for our commercial paper program as of december 31 2007 we have not utilized this facility during 2007 commercial paper notes with an aggregate par value of 12 billion and maturities ranging from one to 97 days were issued we believe the shortterm nature of these borrowings and the availability of funds from operations mitigates our interest rate risk exposure 

foreign exchange risk gfx engages primarily in the purchase and sale of our foreign exchange futures contracts on the cme globex platform to provide additional liquidity in these products gfx subsequently enters into offsetting transactions using futures contracts or spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market to limit its market risk any potential impact on the gfx earnings from a change in foreign exchange rates would not be significant net intraday position limits which are established for each trader totaled 120 million in aggregate notional value as of december 31 2007 

at december 31 2007 gfx held futures positions with a notional value of 1317 million offset by a similar amount of spot foreign exchange positions the notional value of futures positions at december 31 2006 totaled 1118 million all positions are marked to market on a daily basis using our foreign exchange settlement prices with resulting gain or loss reflected in other revenues net trading gains were 92 million and 70 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

the thirdparty contract relating to our ecbot electronic trading platform obligates us to make payments denominated in pounds sterling as a result we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 

we engage in foreign currency hedging activities in order to reduce our risk from movements in foreign currency exchange rates where practicable to do so however where we are not able to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions on terms satisfactory to us we retain risk associated with movements in foreign currency exchange rates the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases of materials and services and liabilities created in the normal course of our business we do not rely on economic hedges to manage risk 

we currently utilize foreign currency forward contracts that we have identified as fair value hedges these are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on firm commitments for purchases of fixed annual and quarterly services denominated in pounds sterling forward contracts designated as hedges had a notional amount of approximating 133 million £67 million at december 31 2007 certain forward contracts previously designated as hedges have been undesignated as a result of negotiations with vendors which reduced the firm commitments previously hedged forward contracts which were undesignated had a notional value of approximately 60 million £30 million at december 31 2007 the fair value of hedging contracts and nonhedging contracts was 18 million and 08 million respectively at december 31 2007 losses related to contracts that no longer qualify for hedge accounting totaled 01 million in 2007

 item 1 business tableend general 

we are the largest futures exchange in the united states for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts often called derivatives as measured by 2006 annual trading volume for the second consecutive year our annual trading volume surpassed one billion contracts we posted record trading volume of 13 billion contracts in 2006 an increase of 28 over 2005 which was previously our busiest year in 2006 our customers who include our members traded futures contracts and options on futures contracts with an underlying value of 824 trillion as of december 31 2006 our open interest record was 525 million contracts set on september 14 2006 open interest is the number of outstanding contracts at the close of the trading day at the exchange and is a leading indicator of liquidity liquidity of markets or the ability of a market to quickly and efficiently absorb the execution of large purchases or sales is key to attracting customers and contributing to a market’s success 

futures and options on futures provide a way to protect against – and potentially profit from – price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities futures contracts are legally binding agreements to buy or sell something in the future such as livestock or foreign currency the buyer and seller of a futures contract agree on a price today for a product to be delivered and paid for in the future each contract specifies the quantity of the item and the time of delivery or payment an option on a futures contract is a right but not an obligation to sell or buy a futures contract at a specified price on or before a certain expiration date 

our products provide a means for hedging speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with among other things interest rate sensitive instruments equity ownership changes in the value of foreign currency and changes in the prices of commodities our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments 

as a marketplace for global risk management our exchange brings together buyers and sellers of derivatives products which trade on our cme globex electronic trading platform on our trading floors through open outcry and via privately negotiated transactions that we clear we offer market participants the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities and alternative investments our key products include cme eurodollar contracts and contracts based on major us stock indexes such as the sp 500 nasdaq100 and russell 2000 we also offer contracts for the principal foreign currencies and for a number of commodity products including cattle hogs and dairy 

we own our clearing house which is the largest derivatives clearing operation in the world for futures and options on futures and we clear settle and guarantee every contract traded through our exchange our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and soundness of our markets and helps differentiate us from our competitors our clearing house serves as counterparty to every trade – becoming the buyer to each seller of a futures contract and the seller to each buyer this process substantially reduces credit risk performance bond collateral deposits are required at each level in the clearing process – customer to broker broker to clearing firm clearing firm to our clearing house the performance bond is a goodfaith deposit that represents the minimum amount of protection against potential losses as of december 31 2006 we acted as custodian for approximately 474 billion in performance bond collateral including approximately 65 billion in deposits for noncme products in addition ownership of our clearing house enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development technology market regulation and other risk management activities our goal is to design our system to service historical peak volumes provide clearing services to cbot and other exchanges and clear new products 

cme was founded in 1898 as a notforprofit corporation in november 2000 we demutualized and became a shareholderowned corporation as a consequence we adopted a forprofit approach to our business including strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing trading volume efficiency and liquidity in december 2002 cme holdings completed its initial public offering of its class a common stock and became the first us financial exchange to be publicly traded 

  

in connection with our demutualization we opened access to our markets by allowing unlimited direct access to the cme globex platform for all market participants today any individual or institutional customer guaranteed by a clearing firm is able to obtain direct access to the cme globex platform as a result of the increased access to our markets all market participants now have the ability to view bids and offers in the market generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to encourage increased liquidity in our markets in 2006 volume on the cme globex electronic trading platform represented 71 of our trading volume compared with 70 in 2005 

in 2006 we entered into an agreement with the new york mercantile exchange or “nymex” to become the exclusive electronic trading service provider for nymex’s energy futures and options contracts and for metals products listed on its comex division this builds upon our successful clearing processing arrangement with cbot which was fully implemented in january 2004 the addition of energy contracts onto cme globex further diversifies our product offerings and creates the first electronic derivatives trading environment that offers global access to all major asset classes – interest rates stock indexes foreign exchange agricultural commodities and now energy we also recently announced our proposed merger with cbot holdings to establish the world’s most diverse global exchange the combined company to be named cme group inc or “cme group” is expected to create operational and cost efficiencies for market users as well as value for our shareholders 

our principal executive offices are located at 20 south wacker drive chicago illinois 60606 and our telephone number is 3129301000 

competitive strengths 

we have established ourselves as a premier global marketplace for financial risk management we believe our principal competitive strengths are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 highly liquid markets the liquidity in our markets is a key factor in attracting and retaining customers as of december 31 2006 our open interest record was 525 million contracts set on september 14 2006 during 2006 we posted record trading volume of 13 billion contracts an increase of 28 over 2005 making us the largest exchange in the united states and the second largest in the world for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts during that period based on annual trading volume 

global benchmark products we believe our key products serve as global benchmarks for valuing and managing risk our cme eurodollar futures contract serves as a global benchmark for measuring the relative value of us dollardenominated shortterm fixedincome securities similarly the sp 500 nasdaq100 and russell indexes are considered primary tools for benchmarking investment performance against us equity market exposure our sp 500 nasdaq100 and russell index contracts which are based on these benchmarks are recognized by our customers as efficient tools for managing and hedging their equity risks 

diverse portfolio of products and services we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing and offering to our customers a diverse array of products as well as a broad range of trade execution and clearing services we have a long history of developing innovative products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities and alternative investments designed to appeal to institutional and individual customers we offer both electronic ordermatching services and open outcry auction trading and we provide facilities to clear privately negotiated transactions our markets provide important risk management tools to our customers we work closely with our customers to create markets and products that meet their needs these relationships help us to anticipate and lead industry changes 

whollyowned clearing house we own our clearing house which clears settles and guarantees every contract traded through our exchange and futures and options on futures contracts traded through cbot in 2006 our clearing house cleared an average of 86 million contracts daily and 21 billion contracts overall as of december 31 2006 we acted as custodian for approximately 474 billion in performance bond collateral including approximately 65 billion in deposits for noncme products and in 2006 moved an average of 17 billion of settlement funds through our clearing system each day we believe our performance guarantee is a major attraction to our markets particularly compared to the overthecounter or “otc” markets because it substantially reduces counterparty risk our clearing system permits more efficient use of capital for our customers by allowing netting of long and short positions in a single type of contract and providing risk offset and crossmargining arrangements with several other leading clearing houses 

  

proven and scalable technology we believe our ability to use technology effectively has been a key factor in the successful development of our business as a result of significant investments in our technology asset base we possess fast reliable and fully integrated trading and clearing systems our goal is to design our highly scalable systems to accommodate additional products with relatively limited modifications on june 8 2006 we processed a record of approximately 33 million transactions the core components of our system infrastructure for trading clearing and risk management are becoming widely adopted throughout the futures industry resulting in common interfaces and efficiencies for intermediaries and customers for example our cme span risk evaluation system has been adopted by more than 50 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide 

global reach globalization of financial markets is expanding the customer base for futures products beyond traditional boundaries our electronic trading services which are available nearly 24 hours a day and five days per week position us to take advantage of this development we have seven international telecommunications hubs in europe and asia these hubs reduce connectivity costs and house direct electronic connections between the foreign customer and cme globex our electronic trading platform in the fall of 2006 to better serve our customers in asia we opened our asia office in hong kong and established an additional telecommunications hub in singapore we also have international offices in london tokyo and sydney as a result of our efforts to target global customers including our international incentive programs we now have direct customer access to our exchange in over 70 countries 

growth strategy 

our record revenues and annual trading volume in 2006 reflect our focus on strategic advancement through the execution of our growth strategy we have expanded our core business organically added innovative new products for global markets provided tradingrelated services more broadly and undertaken significant acquisitions and alliances to leverage our core strength and grow our business nonorganically we intend to continue to grow our business by 

 

  

  

  

 generating organic growth we intend to advance our position as a leader in the futures industry by generating organic growth by launching new products and expanding into the otc market 

 

   

 in august 2006 we completed our acquisition of swapstream a leading electronic trading platform for interest rate swaps swapstream offers advanced functionality for trading interest rate swaps that provides dealers with the flexibility to interact with one or more banks one or more brokers or any combination of these to build their own marketplace and distribute their liquidity the platform also features a sophisticated permissionbased system that allows market participants to publish customized prices and pricing curves based on both credit and counterparty considerations we will provide swapstream users with greater financial and operational efficiencies by leveraging the capabilities of clearing 360 a new initiative that offers a comprehensive clearing solution for otc market participants 

  

providing tradingrelated services providing thirdparty transaction processing clearing and related services is a key element of our strategy and in 2006 we generated 90 million in revenues from this source it accounted for 8 of total revenues approximately 76 million came from the services that we provide to cbot through our transaction process agreement initiated in 2003 this strategic relationship generates positive returns and increased efficiencies for cme cbot and market users worldwide 

in april 2006 we became the exclusive electronic trading service provider for nymex’s energy futures and options contracts and for metals products listed on its comex division initial trading of nymex products under this agreement began in june sidebyside electronic trading during regular trading hours began in early september followed by the launch of comex metals products in early december this relationship accounted for 14 million of our processing services revenue in 2006 

we believe we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering these services on a costeffective basis in combination with the potential to access our broad distribution customer base and experienced liquidity providers 

leveraging our technology technology remains a key component of our growth strategy we made significant enhancements to improve the speed functionality and reliability of our cme globex platform in 2006 we expanded the range of products available to market users on the cme globex platform thereby making our markets easier and less expensive to access in 2006 956 million contracts traded electronically on our cme globex platform an increase of 31 over the total electronic trading volume in 2005 of 730 million contracts 

our commitment to grow electronic options volume remains strong in 2005 we integrated our enhanced options system for trading cme eurodollar options into our cme globex electronic trading platform this enhanced functionality is designed to facilitate trading of complex combination and spread trades typically used with shortterm interest rate options on futures within a fully transparent and competitive execution environment in 2006 we also added mass quoting functionality and new market maker programs to increase the liquidity of our options market in 2006 electronic trading in our options contracts increased to 310 million contracts from 117 million in 2005 we plan to significantly enhance our functionality with the addition of more userdefined spreads for eurodollar options in the first quarter of 2007 

we also continue to expand our customer base and increase our trading volume by broadening the access order routing trading and clearing solutions we offer to existing and prospective customers we provide our customers with the flexibility to access our markets in the most costeffective manner for them in the fourth quarter of 2006 we provided our customer firms the opportunity to connect their colocated trading servers to our network over highspeed fiber optic connections these server connections are expected to decrease network latency times for order entry to the cme globex trading platform to less than one millisecond 

advancing new business opportunities we have consistently said that we would focus our merger and acquisition efforts on infrastructure cost savings opportunities in order to create value for our customers and shareholders to that end in october 2006 we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement with cbot holdings and cbot the merger is expected to close by midyear 2007 subject to a number of approvals including shareholder cbot member and regulatory approvals as well as completion of customary closing conditions the combined company is expected to create operational and cost efficiencies for market users among other things we expect the merger to allow us to leverage each company’s distinct product lines for the benefit of customers around the world we also expect that the merger will result in the extension of our global distribution and customer reach particularly in europe and asia where we already have a significant presence and where we see growth potential we expect annual expense savings of more than 125 million in the second year following the close the bulk of the synergies result from reducing technology and administrative costs and creating more efficient trading floor operations

our broad range of products includes futures contracts and options on futures contracts based on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities and alternative investments our products are traded through the cme globex electronic trading platform our open outcry auction markets or through privately negotiated transactions that we clear for the year ended december 31 2006 we derived 8661 million or 79 of our total revenues from fees associated with trading and clearing our products these fees include per contract charges for trade execution clearing and cme globex fees fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded the method of trade and the trading privileges of the customer making the trade generally members are charged lower fees than nonmembers certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our efforts to encourage increased liquidity in our markets our markets also generate valuable data and information regarding pricing and trading activity in our products we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

the following table shows the average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product lines for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

  interest rate products cme interest rate products enable banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks and in turn help to reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing our interest rate products include our global benchmark cme eurodollar futures contract which celebrated its 25 th anniversary in december 2006 when launched on december 9 1981 cme eurodollar futures which are based on us dollars on deposit in commercial banks located outside the united states were the world’s first cashsettled futures contract during 2006 cme eurodollar futures had an average daily volume of 20 million contracts which was 37 of our overall average daily trading volume eurodollar futures contracts are used by financial institutions to manage interest rate risks primarily out through five years we also offer contracts based on other shortterm interest rates such as onemonth libor which stands for the london interbank offered rate and euroyen in october 2006 we launched cme eurodollar fiveyear emini bundles the contract is designed to create a more cost effective means of providing exposure for interest rate derivative market participants to the critical fiveyear point on the us interest rate swapcme eurodollar futures curve interest rate products represented 58 of our trading volume during 2006 an average of 31 million contracts per day 

we continue to develop and implement new electronic functionality to accommodate trading strategies required for electronic trading of cme eurodollar contracts in july 2006 we launched userdefined covered spreads for options userdefined spreads provide our customers with a high degree of flexibility as they create unique spread combinations this new functionality is designed for traders who commonly use volatility strategies to trade eurodollar options in 2006 average daily volume of cme eurodollars traded electronically increased to 18 million contracts from 13 million in 2005 since the 2004 launch of our enhanced options system which was integrated onto cme globex in 2005 over 25 million cme eurodollar options have traded electronically on june 15 2006 we had record electronic trading in cme eurodollar options with over 490000 contracts trading on cme globex we intend to continue to introduce functionality that will accommodate other complex trading strategies electronically for example we plan to significantly enhance our functionality with the addition of more userdefined spreads for eurodollar options in the first quarter of 2007 in 2006 we also implemented an incentive program designed to expand electronic trading of eurodollar options under which owners and lessees of exchange memberships who trade at least 30 of their total cme eurodollar option volume electronically will be entitled to a discounted fee 

  

we intend to increase our revenues from our interest rate product line by continuing to optimize pricing of existing products introducing new products to increase our trading volume and enhancing the functionality of our cme globex electronic platform to increase the electronic trading volume of our options on futures contracts we have adopted new policies and practices that are closely aligned with customer demand and designed to promote enhanced market penetration 

equity products our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure for hedging or speculative purposes to a change in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities by allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks cme equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets we offer trading in futures contracts based upon the sp 500 index nasdaq100 index certain russell indexes including the russell 2000 and other small medium and largecapitalization domestic indexes and indexes on foreign equity markets our total trading volume for equity products rose 24 in 2006 to 435 million contracts from 350 million contracts in 2005 trading in these products represented 32 of our total trading volume during 2006 an average of over 17 million contracts per day 

we have a license agreement with standard  poor’s corporation to use certain sp stock indexes and the related intellectual property the license is exclusive through december 31 2016 and nonexclusive from that date through december 31 2017 with some exceptions we also have a license agreement with the nasdaq stock market inc or “nasdaq” that allows us to offer futures and options on futures contracts based on the nasdaq100 and the nasdaq composite indexes exclusively until october 2012 and based on the nasdaq biotechnology index provided certain performance criteria are met we also have a license agreement with frank russell company that allows us to offer futures and options contracts based on certain russell indexes including the russell 2000 for a more detailed discussion of these license agreements see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—licensing agreements” in 2006 98 of our equity products trading volume was based on the sp 500 index the nasdaq100 index and the russell 2000 index 

we also offer trakrs contracts which are a series of nontraditional futures contracts developed with merrill lynch  co inc and licensed exclusively to us for north america these contracts are the first broadbased index products traded on a us futures exchange that can be sold by securities brokers trakrs are designed to enable customers to track an index of stocks bonds currencies or other financial instruments 

we also offer emini contracts which trade exclusively on our cme globex platform and are onefifth the size of their standard counterparts these products are designed to address the growing demand for equity derivatives and electronically traded products 

we believe our leading market position in equity index products is a result of the liquidity of our markets the status of the sp 500 and the nasdaq100 indexes as two of the principal us financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns and the appeal to investors and traders of our emini products and other equity products and our cme globex platform these investors include public and private pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets 

we believe future growth in our equity products will come from the introduction of electronically traded options on our existing equity index products including our eminis expanding customer access to our electronic markets enhancing the functionality of our cme globex electronic platform to increase the electronic trading volume of our options on futures contracts as well as further educating the marketplace on the benefits of these products 

foreign exchange products cme is the largest regulated market for foreign exchange trading we became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in 1972 our foreign exchange market serves as an effective and efficient means of risk transfer for the global foreign exchange market bringing together a broad array of client segments by offering investment as well as risk management opportunities our customers benefit from dealing anonymously in a fully transparent market where large and small customers have equal access to the same prices and deep pool of liquidity our foreign exchange products provide the tools and resources to hedge foreign exchange risk facilitating crossborder trade and commerce while mitigating the risks to profitability due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market our foreign exchange market attracts both buy and sellside investors including commercial and investment banks hedge funds commodity trading advisors proprietary trading firms and individual investors roughly 88 of our foreign exchange products are traded electronically on the cme globex platform ensuring that business is transacted quickly with maximum operational efficiency 

  

today we offer more than 40 foreign exchange futures and more than 30 foreign exchange options on futures products covering major as well as a broad array of emerging market currency pairs in the following currencies euro japanese yen british pound swiss franc canadian dollar australian dollar new zealand dollar mexican peso brazilian real norwegian krone swedish krona czech koruna hungarian forint polish zloty russian ruble south african rand israeli shekel korean won and chinese renminbi 

in 2006 we saw an average daily volume of 453000 contracts per day with a notional value of 55 billion a day on december 8 2006 foreign exchange volume reached a record of 13 million contracts reflecting a record notional value of 158 billion our total foreign exchange trading volume increased 35 in 2006 with a total of 114 million contracts traded in 2006 versus 84 million in 2005 trading in our foreign exchange products represented nearly 85 of our total trading volume in 2006 in 2006 electronically traded foreign exchange volume increased 46 over 2005 from 681 million contracts to 995 million contracts open outcry trading decreased 26 from 79 million contracts in 2005 to 58 million contracts in 2006 

we believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and diversifying our product suite and customer base as well as the global footprint of our foreign exchange products we are expanding our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array of customer segments and we expect continued strong growth in the electronic execution of foreign exchange options on cme globex in 2007 we are also exploring the addition of new currency pairs to our product suite following the launch of our israeli shekel korean won and chinese renminbi contracts in 2006 as we expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market we expect increased trading volume from customers outside of the united states 

commodity and alternative investment products cme commodity and alternative investment products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management for the agricultural community these products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities including agricultural producers of commodities and food processors commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business we have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products including futures contracts based on cattle hogs pork bellies lumber and dairy products we also created a weather derivative market which enables businesses that could be adversely affected by unanticipated temperature swings or unusually high snowfall to transfer such risks commodity and alternative investment products accounted for 15 of our trading volume during 2006 an average of more than 78000 contracts per day and an increase of 41 from 2005 on september 13 2006 we had our highest volume day ever with 156000 contracts traded 

we continue to execute our strategy of growing our customer base and providing sidebyside access to our commodity markets for example in december 2006 we launched electronic trading of options on cme live cattle and lean hog futures we also added new functionality for our dairy class iii milk futures to enable customers to hedge their dairy positions for longer durations with a single trade execution we believe the changing perception of commodities as an asset class provides an opportunity for growth in our markets 

market data and information products our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products the market data we supply is a key component to making trading decisions we sell our market data which includes information about bids offers trades and trade size to banks brokerdealers pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions we distribute our market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets through our electronic facilities we also distribute market data via dedicated networks to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges other third party data providers and news services and then resell their consolidated data revenues from market data products totaled 808 million or 7 of our total revenues in 2006 

we continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by packaging the basic data we have traditionally offered with advanced analytical data and information for example in september 2006 we announced an upgrade option to our market data offerings to include top five price levels of bids and offers for any electronicallytraded cme futures product as part of each cme market data package previously this was only available as an addon service the expanded data set offered in each package will provide cme data subscribers a deeper view of the market including price volume and liquidity beginning in january 2007 

as part of our market data and information products business we also supply services to onechicago and sp in connection with the usage reporting contract administration and associated billing and revenue collection for the display and integration of their market data into our standard market data distribution 

  

execution 

our primary trade execution facilities consist of our cme globex electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors both of these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency and are supported by substantial infrastructure and technology for order routing trade reporting market data dissemination and market surveillance and regulation in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house the following chart shows the range of trade execution choices we provide our customers in some of our key products 

 

 cme globex electronic trading platform the cme globex electronic trading platform maintains an electronic centralized order book and trade execution algorithm for futures contracts and options on futures contracts and allows users to enter orders directly into the order book initially our electronic trading platform was used to offer our products to customers after the close of our regular daytime trading sessions today however we trade some of our most successful products on the cme globex platform nearly 24 hours a day five days a week in 2006 71 of our trading volume was executed using cme globex compared with 70 in 2005 during 2006 approximately 74 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from electronic trading on december 1 2006 cme globex volume set a new singleday record of 80 million contracts traded 

open outcry trading open outcry trading represented 28 of our total trading volume in 2006 the trading floors are the centralized meeting place for floor traders and floor brokers representing customer orders to trade contracts the trading floors covering approximately 70000 square feet have tiered booths surrounding the pits from which clearing firm personnel can communicate with customers regarding current market activity and prices and receive orders either electronically or by telephone in addition our trading floors display current market information and news on electronic wallboards hung above the pits during 2006 approximately 21 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from open outcry trading 

privately negotiated transactions in addition to offering traditional open outcry and electronic trading through the cme globex platform we permit qualified customers to trade our products by entering into privately negotiated transactions which are reported and included in the market data we distribute we also clear settle and guarantee these transactions through our clearing house some market participants value privately negotiated transactions as a way to ensure that large transactions can be completed at a single price or in a single transaction while preserving their ability to effectively complete a hedging risk management or other trading strategy during 2006 approximately 5 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from this type of trading 

other trading platforms cme economic derivatives trade on the cme auction markets platform the auctions are conducted using a patented process of mutualized orderfilling developed and operated by longitude llc an international securities exchange company additionally as a result of our acquisition of swapstream we now offer the ability to trade the euro and swiss francdenominated mediumterm and longterm interest rate swaps and spread trading on the swapstream platform future plans for enhancing the platform include the addition of the launch of shortterm maturities us dollarand the british pounddenominated swaps 

  

clearing 

we operate our own clearing house that clears settles and guarantees the performance of all transactions matched through our execution facilities and futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded through cbot in 2006 our clearing house cleared an average of 86 million contracts daily and 21 billion contracts overall many derivatives exchanges do not provide clearing services for trades matched through their execution facilities relying instead on outside clearing houses to provide these services ownership and control of our own clearing house enables us to capture the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products this is particularly important for trade execution alternatives such as privately negotiated block trades where we can derive a higher clearing fee for each contract traded compared to other trades by owning our clearing house we also control the cost structure and the technology development cycle for our clearing services it also helps us manage our new product initiatives without being dependent on an outside entity we believe having an integrated clearing function provides significant competitive advantages additionally owning our own clearing house allows us to generate additional revenue by providing clearing services to other exchanges such as cbot 

as of december 31 2006 our open interest stood at 351 million contracts and our open interest record was 525 million contracts set on september 14 2006 as of december 31 2006 we acted as custodian for approximately 474 billion in performance bond collateral deposited by our clearing firms and during 2006 we moved an average of approximately 17 billion a day in settlement funds through our clearing system in addition our clearing house guarantees the performance of our contracts with a financial safeguards package of approximately 46 billion open interest in cbot products cleared by our clearing house on december 31 2006 was 149 million contracts 

the clearing function provides three primary benefits to our markets efficient highvolume transaction processing cost and capital efficiencies and a reliable credit guarantee the services we provide can be broadly categorized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 transaction processing and position management  our clearing 21 system developed with nymex in the early 1990s processes reported trades and positions on a realtime basis providing users with instantaneous information on trades positions and risk exposure clearing 21 is able to process trades in futures and options products securities and cash instruments clearing 21 can also support complex new product types including combinations options on combinations options on options swaps repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other instruments through clearing 21 user interfaces our clearing firms can electronically manage their positions exercise options enter transactions related to foreign exchange deliveries manage collateral posted to meet performance bond requirements and access all of our other online applications together with our order routing and trade matching services we offer straightthrough electronic processing of transactions in which an order is electronically routed matched cleared and made available to the clearing firm’s backoffice systems for further processing 

crossmargining and mutual offset services we have led the derivatives industry in establishing crossmargining agreements with other leading clearing houses crossmargining arrangements reduce capital costs for clearing firms and customers these agreements permit an individual clearing house to recognize a clearing firm’s open positions at other participating clearing houses and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at other participating clearing houses this arrangement reduces the need for collateral deposits by the clearing firm for example our crossmargining program with the options clearing corporation reduced performance bond requirements for our members by approximately 20 billion a day in 2006 we have implemented crossmargining arrangements with nymex the fixed income clearing corporation and lchclearnet group for positions at the london international financial futures and options exchange that are cleared through lchclearnet group in addition our mutual offset agreement with the singapore derivatives exchange allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products and then transfer them back to the originating exchange this mutual offset arrangement enables firms to execute trades at either exchange virtually 24 hours per day this arrangement has been in place since 1984 and was renewed in october 2006 for an additional three year term with automatic renewals for one year each unless terminated by either party 

  

market protection and risk management our clearing house guarantee of performance is a significant attraction and an important part of the functioning of our exchange because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products our clearing house uses our proprietary cme span software which determines the appropriate performance bond requirements by simulating the gains and losses of complex portfolios we typically hold performance bond collateral to cover at least 95 of price changes for a given product within a given historical period performance bond requirements for a clearing firm’s or customer’s overall portfolio are calculated using cme span 

at each settlement cycle our clearing house values at the market price prevailing at that time or markstomarket all open positions and requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value our clearing house markstomarket all open positions at least twice a day and more often if market volatility warrants markingtomarket provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract 

having a marktomarket cycle of a minimum of two times a day helps protect the financial integrity of our clearing house our clearing firms and market participants this allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions 

in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the clearing firm to cover its payment obligation these assets include security deposits performance bonds and any other available assets such as the proceeds from the sale of class a and class b common stock and trading rights of the clearing firm at our exchange owned by or assigned to the clearing firm in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent of a clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our surplus funds security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit we maintain a committed 800 million 364day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks we increased the facility from 750 million to 800 million in 2006 in connection with its annual renewal we have the option to increase the facility from 800 million to 1 billion subject to approval by the participating banks we are required to post additional collateral in connection with any such increase this line of credit may also be utilized if there is a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay settlement payments between our clearing house and clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as security deposit funds in our second interest earning facility program called “ief2” to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line 

  

the following shows the available assets of our clearing house at december 31 2006 in the event of a payment default by a cme clearing firm 

cme clearing house available assets 

in millions 

 

       settlement collateral and delivery services we manage final settlement in all of our contracts including cash settlement physical delivery of selected commodities and option exercises and assignments because some initial and maintenance performance bonds from clearing firms as well as marktomarket obligations on some of our contracts are denominated in various foreign currencies we offer multicurrency performance bond and settlement services we also offer the moneychanger function to our clearing firms this service provides members with access to overnight funds in various foreign currencies at competitive bidask spreads free of charge to satisfy the terms of a foreign currency denominated futures contract 

generally although more than 95 of all futures contracts are liquidated before the expiration of the contract the underlying financial instruments or commodities for the remainder of the contracts must be delivered we act as the delivery agent for all cme contracts ensuring timely delivery by the seller of the exact quality and quantity specified in a contract and full and timely payment by the buyer 

  

to administer its system of financial safeguards efficiently our clearing house has developed banking relationships with a network of major us banks and banking industry infrastructure providers such as the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications among the key services provided to our clearing house by these banks and service providers are a variety of custody credit and payment services that support the substantial financial commitments and processes backing the guarantee of our clearing house to market participants 

investment services in order to achieve collateral efficiencies for our clearing firms we have established a number of collateral programs under the designation interest earning facility or “ief” under this program our clearing firms may select from four different ief programs to meet their individual needs the programs are designed to enable our clearing firms to make optimal use of the demand deposit cash accounts and security accounts they have established to satisfy our performance bond requirements we earn fee income in return for providing these valueadded services to our clearing firms 

our clearing house launched a securities lending program in 2001 using a portion of certain securities deposited to meet the proprietary performance bond requirements of our clearing firms under this securities lending program we lend a security to a third party and receive collateral in the form of cash the majority of the cash is then invested on an overnight basis to generate interest income the related interest expense represents payment to the borrower of the security for the cash collateral retained during the duration of the lending transaction securities on loan are markedtomarket daily and compared to collateral received 

technology 

our operation of both electronic and open outcry trading facilities and a clearing house has influenced the design and implementation of the technologies that support our operations 

trading technology we have a proven track record of operating successful electronic and open outcry markets by developing and integrating multiple evolving technologies that support a growing and substantial trading volume the integrated suite of technologies we employ to accomplish this has been designed to support a significant expansion of our current business and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our technology base into new markets products and services 

as electronic trading activity expands we continue to provide greater match engine functionality unique to various markets market models and product types we have adopted a modular approach to technology development and engineered an integrated set of solutions that support multiple specialized markets we continually monitor and upgrade our capacity requirements our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our historical peak transactions in our highest volume products significant investments in production planning quality assurance and certification processes have enhanced our ability to expedite the delivery of the system enhancements that we develop for our customers we will continue to need to expand and upgrade our technology and systems to respond to increases in trading volume and order transaction traffic 

speed reliability scalability capacity and functionality are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms a substantial portion of our operating budget is dedicated to system design development and operations in order to achieve high levels of overall system performance in 2006 we enhanced our cme globex platform including our market data platform that now uses 50 less bandwidth than legacy systems we also plan to significantly enhance our functionality with the addition of more userdefined spreads for cme eurodollar options in the first quarter of 2007 userdefined spreads provide our customers with a high degree of flexibility as they create unique spread combinations we also have two remote data facilities to provide additional system capacity and redundancy for our trading and clearing technology our data centers support our customer interfaces trading and execution systems as well as clearing and settlement operations additionally in the fourth quarter of 2006 we provided our customer firms the opportunity to connect their colocated trading servers to our network over highspeed fiber optic connections these server connections are expected to decrease network latency times for order entry to the cme globex trading platform to less than one millisecond 

  

the technology systems supporting our trading operations can be divided into five major categories 

 

 the cme globex electronic trading platform includes the distribution order routing order management trade matching and market data technology cme globex’s modularity and functionality enable us to selectively add products with unique trading characteristics onto the trading platform 

the distribution technologies we offer differentiate our platform and bring liquidity and trading volume to our execution facilities as of december 31 2006 we had more than 1100 direct connections with our systems many of these customers connect through a dedicated private network that is readily available has wide distribution and provides fast connections in the americas europe and asia we have also established telecommunications hubs in amsterdam dublin gibraltar london milan paris and singapore to respond to customer requests and reduce the cost of trading for our foreign customers we now have direct customer access to our exchange in over 70 countries 

in order routing and management we offer a range of mechanisms and were among the first us derivatives exchanges to fully implement the fix 42 protocol—the standard order routing protocol used within the securities industry in addition our order routing and order management systems are capable of supporting multiple electronic trading match engines this functionality gives us great latitude in the types of markets that we choose to serve 

several key technology platforms and standards are used to support these activities including faulttolerant nonstop tandem systems ibm mainframes sun microsystems and hewlett packard servers hewlett packard and dell pcs oracle and db2 databases linux unix novell tibco middleware and multivendor network solutions in 2006 we integrated hewlett packard’s new integrity nonstop servers that incorporate intel itanium processors into cme globex this has improved response time to between 20 and 40 milliseconds while accommodating significantly higher trading volume 

our futures match engine is based upon the computerized trading and match software known as the nsc system we have a longterm license from euronextparis under which we have the ability to modify and upgrade the performance of the basic nsc system to optimize its performance to suit our needs we have a fully trained development team that maintains upgrades and customizes our version of the nsc system the customized enhancements that we have developed address the unique trading demands of each marketplace that we serve we continue to focus on performance features of the match engine and presently have multiple enhancements under development 

our options match engine was designed and built at cme with focus on the speed of matching buy and sell orders and fault tolerance for 24hour trading we work on continuous enhancements to build a fullyfunctional electronic marketplace for options where our customers can offset their risk with as much ease as in our open outcry trading facilities we also offer userdefined functionality for customers to create and trade customized spreads of instruments 

clearing technology clearing 21 our clearing and settlement software and cme span our margining and risk management software form the core of our clearing technology 

clearing 21 is a system for highvolume highcapacity clearing and settlement of exchangebased transactions that we developed jointly with nymex in the early 1990s the system offers clearing firms improved efficiency and reduced costs clearing 21’s modular design gives us the ability to rapidly introduce new products the software can be customized to meet the unique needs of specialized markets 

  

cme span is our sophisticated margining and risk management software cme span has now been adopted by more than 50 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide this software simulates the effects of changing market conditions on a complex portfolio and uses standard options pricing models to determine a portfolio’s overall risk cme span then generates a performance bond requirement that typically covers 95 of price changes within a given historical period

marketing programs and advertising 

our marketing programs primarily target institutional customers and to a lesser extent individual traders our marketing programs for institutional customers aim to inform traders portfolio managers corporate treasurers and other market professionals about novel uses of our products such as new hedging and risk management strategies we also strive to educate these users about changes in product design performance bond requirements and new clearing services we participate in major domestic and international trade shows and seminars regarding futures contracts and options on futures contracts and other derivatives products in addition we sponsor educational workshops and marketing events designed to educate market users about our products through these relationships and programs we attempt to understand the needs of our customer base and use information provided by them to drive our product development efforts 

our advertising strategies seek to increase awareness and strengthen perceptions of cme among our institutional and retail customers as well as support an increase in our trading volume in september 2006 we launched a new global brand advertising campaign the print campaign “smart people great results” prominently features testimonials from some of our leading global customers – fund managers financial advisors and professional traders – showing how our benchmark futures and options products improve the way markets work and enable them to achieve positive financial results we also engaged vsa partners inc as our agency of record in december 2006 to create an integrated marketing program to reflect our evolution and role in the world economy our primary method of advertising has been through print media utilizing trade magazines and newsletters as well as daily business publications however we also use online television sponsorship and other targeted advertisements to reach our target audiences 

in july 2005 we launched cme magazine a publication designed to keep customers uptodate on developments at cme that can enhance their participation in the derivatives industry cme magazine features customer case histories trend stories editorials and news briefs the magazine is published several times a year and is available on our web site 

competition 

prior to the passage of the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 or the “cfma” futures trading was generally required to take place on or subject to the rules of a federally designated contract market the costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation complying with applicable regulatory requirements establishing efficient execution facilities and liquidity pools and attracting customers created significant barriers to entry for competing exchanges the cfma eroded the historical dominance by the exchanges of futures trading in the united states by among other things eliminating uncertainty with respect to the enforceability of private transactions in most futures contracts and similar products authorizing the use of electronic trading systems to conduct both private and public futures transactions and lowering or eliminating entry barriers for new exchanges for a more detailed description of the regulation of our industry and the regulatory changes brought on by the cfma see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

the cfma and other changing market dynamics have led to increasing competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different domestic and international sources of varied size business objectives and resources we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges otc markets and clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and other competitors 

at yearend 2006 there were 57 futures exchanges located in 30 countries including nine futures exchanges in the united states the global derivatives industry has grown increasingly competitive exchanges intermediaries and even end users are consolidating and otc and unregulated entities are constantly evolving for example in response to growing competition many marketplaces in both europe and the united states have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth cbot and the intercontinentalexchange inc or “ice” completed their initial public offerings in 2005 and nymex went public in 2006 in september 2006 ice and the new york board of trade or “nybot” entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which nybot will become a whollyowned subsidiary of ice and ice will obtain nybot’s clearing house in december 2006 shareholders of nyse group and euronext approved the merger of equals between the companies that was announced in june 2006 additionally 

  

because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets we also compete with the nyse and other securities and options exchanges dealer markets such as nasdaq and alternative trading systems in this product line 

otc markets for foreign exchange and fixedincome derivatives products also compete with us the largest foreign exchange markets are operated primarily as electronic trading systems two of the largest of these operated by electronic brokering services and reuters serve primarily professional foreign exchange trading firms additional electronic platforms designed to serve corporate foreign exchange users have emerged two of these are operated by consortia of interdealer and interbank market participants a third is a proprietary trading system in addition certain provisions of the cfma have led to an increase in unregulated electronic and brokerage trading systems in the foreign exchange market 

the otc fixedincome derivatives market is by far the largest fixedincome derivatives marketplace the otc market consists primarily of interbank and interdealer market participants there is currently no single liquidity pool in the otc fixedincome derivatives market that is comparable to our eurodollar market the otc market for fixedincome derivatives products has traditionally been limited to more customized products and the large credit exposures created in this market and the absence of clearing facilities have limited participation to the most creditworthy institutional participants however the size of this market and technologydriven developments in electronic trading and clearing facilities as well as regulatory changes implemented by the cfma increase the likelihood that one or more substantial liquidity pools will emerge in the future in the otc fixedincome derivatives market 

alternative trade execution facilities that currently specialize in the trading of equity securities have electronic trade execution and routing systems that also can be used to trade products that compete with our products 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent potential competitors because as purveyors of market data these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities as technology firms they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks additionally technology and software firms that develop trading systems hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets 

we also face a threat of trading volume loss if a significant number of our traditional participants decide to trade futures or similar products among themselves without using any exchange or specific trading system the cfma allows nearly all of our largest customers to transact futures or similar products directly with each other while those transactions raise liquidity and credit concerns they may be attractive based on execution costs flexibility of terms negotiability of margin or collateral deposits or other considerations additionally changes under the cfma permitting the establishment of standalone clearing facilities for futures and otc derivatives transactions will facilitate the mitigation of creditrisk concentrations arising from such transactions 

we believe competition among exchanges in the derivatives and securities businesses is based on a number of factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets breadth of product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs 

our business is highly competitive we expect competition to continue to intensify particularly as a result of technological advances and the cfma and other changes introduced by the commodity futures trading commission or “cftc” which have reduced the regulatory requirements for the development and entry of products and markets that are competitive with our own additional factors 

  

that may intensify competition in the future include the growth of recentlyformed forprofit exchanges the consolidation of exchanges customers or intermediaries an increased acceptance of electronic trading and electronic order routing by our customer base and the ability of other exchanges leveraging their technology investment and electronic distribution to enter new markets and list the products of other exchanges 

in addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services including 

 

  

 we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the cost of the services provided quality and reliability of the services timely delivery of the services reputation and value of linking with existing products markets and distribution 

regulatory matters 

the commodity exchange act the scope of which was significantly expanded in 1974 subjected us to comprehensive regulation by the cftc under the 1974 amendments the cftc was granted exclusive jurisdiction over futures contracts and options on such contracts and on commodities such contracts were generally required to be traded on regulated exchanges known as contract markets the commodity exchange act placed our business in a heavily regulated environment but imposed significant barriers to unregulated competition 

in 2000 the cfma significantly altered the regulatory landscape and has had important competitive consequences this legislation greatly expanded the freedom of regulated markets like ours to innovate and respond to competition it also permits us to offer a previously prohibited set of products—single stock futures and futures on narrowbased indexes of securities the provisions that permit us to trade these security futures products require a novel sharing of jurisdiction between the cftc and the securities and exchange commission or the “sec” exchange trading of these security futures products is subject to more burdensome regulation than our other futures products for example in order to trade these products we are required to “notice register” with the sec as a special purpose national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading security futures products and the sec is authorized to review some of our rules relating to these security futures products our members trading those products are subject to registration requirements and duties and obligations to customers under the securities laws that do not pertain to their other futures business 

the cfma excluded or exempted many of the activities of our nonexchange competitors from regulation under the commodity exchange act the cfma created broad exclusions and exemptions from the commodity exchange act that permit derivatives contracts which may serve the same or similar functions as the contracts we offer to be sold in the largely unregulated otc market including through electronic trading facilities 

additionally the cfma permits secregulated and bank clearing organizations to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that such clearing organizations have traditionally cleared the cfma also permits banks and brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to offer and sell foreign exchange futures to retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act 

the cfma created a flexible regulatory framework for us in our capacity as a cftc registrant and eliminated many prescriptive requirements of the commodity exchange act and cftc in favor of more broad and flexible core principles for instance cftcregulated exchanges may now list new contracts and adopt new rules without prior cftc approval under selfcertification procedures permitting timelier product launch and modification 

for regulated markets the cfma created a threetiered regulatory structure the degree of regulation is related to the characteristics of the product and the type of customer that has direct or indirect access to the market with retail customer markets being subject to greater regulation the threetiered regulatory structure is as follows 

 

   

  

 our existing market which trades a broad range of products and permits intermediaries to represent unsophisticated customers is subject to the most thorough oversight as a designated contract market the cfma permits us to organize markets that are subject to lesser regulation depending on the types of products traded and the types of traders markets can be organized that trade only products that are unlikely to be susceptible to manipulation and permit direct trading only among institutional participants in order to achieve a less intrusive degree of oversight for example in 2005 we created cme alternative marketplace inc a whollyowned subsidiary of cme and an exempt board of trade registered with the cftc for the trading of cme economic derivatives 

the cfma also provides for regulation of derivatives clearing organizations or “dcos” like our clearing house separately from the exchanges for which they clear contracts and permits dcos to clear a range of otctraded products in addition to products traded on an exchange the cfma requires a dco that clears for a registered futures exchange to register with the cftc however our clearing house was deemed to be registered by reason of its activities prior to enactment of the cfma our clearing house is required to comply with a separate set of flexible core principles that specifically apply to clearing houses a dco may accept for clearing any new contract or may adopt any new rule or rule amendment by providing to the cftc a written certification that the new contract rule or rule amendment complies with the commodity exchange act alternatively the dco may request that the cftc grant prior approval to any contract rule or rule amendment and the cftc must grant approval within 75 days unless the cftc finds that the proposed contract rule or rule amendment would violate the commodity exchange act 

cme is a selfregulatory organization responsible for ensuring market integrity and financial security for all transactions in its products our integrated compliance and market surveillance functions allow detailed tracking of all trading and clearing activities in addition our markets are subject to oversight by the cftc our regulatory processes are reviewed and audited by the cftc demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “selfregulation” that has been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program on february 1 2007 the cftc issued recommendations as to an appropriate means for designated contract markets to comply with the core principle requiring selfregulatory organizations to mitigate potential conflicts of interest the recommendations require at least 35 of the board of directors of a designated contract market to be directors with no material relationship with the exchange including memberships on the exchange if an exchange were not in compliance with this safe harbor it would be required to demonstrate to the cftc how it otherwise met the requirements of the core principle currently 35 of our board of directors have no industry affiliation other than service on our board although we have not yet completed our assessment as to whether such directors would be considered to have no material relationship with the exchange for purposes of the cftc recommendation the safe harbor also requires that such exchanges have in place a regulatory oversight committee comprised solely of nonindustry directors in april 2004 we became the first futures exchange to appoint a boardlevel committee devoted to selfregulatory oversight the committee is called the market regulation oversight committee and is comprised solely of independent nonindustry directors the committee provides independent oversight of the policies and programs of our market regulation department to ensure effective administration of the exchange’s selfregulatory responsibilities 

from time to time it is proposed in congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated including a possible merger between the cftc and the sec while those proposals have not been adopted to date the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely to the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years which was scheduled to be completed in 2005 this process is still ongoing and could result in legislation that may have a negative impact on the way we operate our exchange including our ability to operate our selfregulatory functions or effectively compete with new entrants into our market place 

from time to time it is proposed in the president’s budget that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions while those proposals have not been adopted to date except for a percontract fee on single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the imposition of any such tax could increase the cost of using our products and consequently our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchange in addition trading rights on our exchange have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets our trading members many of whom act as floor brokers and floor traders benefit from trading rules membership privileges and fee discounts that enhance their open outcry trading opportunities and profits our predominantly electronic trading members benefit from fee discounts and other incentives targeted at increasing electronic trading volume these benefits enhance their electronic trading opportunities and profits our clearing firms benefit from all of the foregoing as well as decisions that increase electronic trading which over time will reduce their costs of doing business on our exchange as a result holders of our class a common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the role they serve in our markets their method of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us 

the board representation rights of our members in combination with the charter provision protections described in the immediately following risk factor could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value 

our certificate of incorporation grants special rights to holders of class b common stock which protect their trading rights and give them special board representation and require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant 

under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our class b shareholders have the ability to protect their rights to trade on our exchange by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of our trading floor in particular these provisions include a grant to the holders of our class b common stock of the right to approve any changes to 

 

  

  

  

 our class b shareholders are also entitled to elect six of the 20 directors on our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent 

our certificate of incorporation also includes a provision requiring us to maintain open outcry floor trading on our exchange for a particular traded product as long as the open outcry market is “liquid” our certificate of incorporation requires us to maintain a facility for conducting business disseminating price information clearing and delivery and to provide reasonable financial support for technology marketing and research for open outcry markets our certificate of incorporation provides specific tests as to whether an open outcry market will be deemed liquid as measured on a quarterly basis if a market is deemed illiquid as a result of a failure to meet any of these tests our board may determine whether such market should be closed 

  

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

we generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees and our processing services provided to third parties we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future each of these revenue sources is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets and in the markets we provide processing services our trading volume is directly affected by us domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets our operating results and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic uncertainty this is because our customers seek to hedge or manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange and commodity markets the future economic environment will be subject to periodic downturns including possible recession and lower volatility in financial markets and may not be as favorable as it has been in recent years as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful trends less favorable than those of recent periods could result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability will be adversely affected 

the success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability and speed required by our customers 

the future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance reliability and speed to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our current overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform however during 2006 28 of our volume and approximately 21 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was generated through our open outcry trading facilities most of our open outcry volume is related to trading in options on our futures contracts our electronic functionality may not be capable of accommodating all of the complex trading strategies typically used for trading options on futures contracts we continue to develop and implement new electronic functionality to accommodate trading strategies required for electronic trading of eurodollar options contracts in august 2005 we integrated our enhanced options system for trading cme eurodollar options into our cme globex electronic trading platform this enhanced functionality is designed to facilitate trading of complex combination and spread trades typically used with shortterm interest rate options on futures within a fully transparent and competitive environment in july 2006 we also launched userdefined covered spreads we intend to continue to introduce functionality that will accommodate other complex trading strategies electronically however we may not complete the development of or successfully implement the required electronic functionality for our options on futures contracts moreover our customers who trade options may not accept our electronic trading systems in either event our ability to increase trading volume of options on futures contracts on the cme globex platform would be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality performance reliability and speed we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading 

  

the enhancement of our electronic trading platform exposes us to risks inherent in operating in the evolving market for electronic transaction services if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or if our customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or our current or potential customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

if we are not able to keep up with rapid technological changes our business will be materially harmed 

to remain competitive we must continue to improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and other features of our software network distribution systems and technologies the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology changes in customer demand and uses of products and services frequent product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing technology and systems obsolete our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological advancements and changing standards in a timely costefficient and competitive manner we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our technology to customer and competitive requirements or emerging industry standards 

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business will not survive 

the derivatives securities and financial services industries are highly competitive we expect that competition will continue to intensify in the future our current and prospective competitors both domestically and around the world are numerous they include securities and securities option exchanges futures exchanges otc markets clearing organizations market data and information vendors electronic communications networks crossing systems and similar entities consortia of large customers consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities at december 31 2006 there were 57 futures exchanges located in 30 countries including nine futures exchanges in the united states the global derivatives industry has grown increasingly competitive exchanges intermediaries and even end users are consolidating and otc and unregulated entities are constantly evolving for example in response to growing competition many marketplaces in both europe and the united states have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth cbot and ice completed their initial public offerings in 2005 and nymex went public in 2006 in september 2006 ice and the nybot entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which nybot will become a whollyowned subsidiary of ice and ice will obtain nybot’s clearing house in december 2006 shareholders of nyse group and euronext approved the merger of equal between the companies that was announced in june 2006 

we believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies the number of businesses providing internetrelated financial services is rapidly growing other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may become competitive with us through acquisitions changes in federal law allow institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar products to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can in addition our competitors may 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed in addition even if new entrants do not significantly erode our market share we may be required to reduce our fees significantly to remain competitive which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure for example we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed on the cme globex electronic trading platform in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period for example our average rate per contract decreased to 0645 for the year ended december 31 2006 from 0664 for the same period in 2005 because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

generally we have experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

the cfma has reduced the barriers of entry into our markets which has led to increased competition and enabled many of our customers to trade futures contracts other than on exchanges these changes may adversely affect our trading volume revenue and profits 

our industry has been subject to several fundamental regulatory changes including changes in the statute under which we have operated since 1974 the commodity exchange act generally required all futures contracts to be executed on an exchange that had been approved by the cftc the “exchange trading requirement” was modified by cftc regulations and interpretations to permit privately negotiated swap contracts to be transacted in the otc market the cftc exemption under which the otc derivatives market operated precluded the otc market from using exchangelike electronic transaction systems and clearing facilities these barriers to competition from the otc market were repealed by the cfma one of the chief beneficiaries of the cfma has been otc dealers and competitors that operate or intend to open electronic trading facilities or to conduct their futures business directly among themselves on a bilateral basis the customers who may access these trading facilities or engage in bilateral private transactions are the same customers who account for a substantial portion of our trading volume the cfma also permits banks brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to engage in foreign exchange futures transactions for or with retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act these customers are the same customers who might otherwise use cme foreign exchange products in the future our industry may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely impact our business including our ability to compete with enterprises which offer offexchange trading and which benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lowercost business model 

  

the cfma also permits bank clearing organizations and clearing organizations regulated by the sec to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that these clearing organizations have traditionally cleared this allocation of jurisdiction may be advantageous to competing clearing organizations and result in a lower volume of trading cleared through our clearing house 

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution alternatives our success also depends on our ability to maintain our trading volume and to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers for example the majority of the clearing and transaction fees we receive from our clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers we believe that in the event one of our clearing firms discontinues operations the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm however we cannot guarantee you that the discontinuation of any clearing firm would not result in our loss of customers which could have an adverse effect on our trading volumes or revenues we also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to lowcost competitors with comparable or superior products services or trade execution facilities if we fail to maintain our trading volume to expand our product offerings or execution facilities or we lose a substantial number of our current customers or are unable to attract new customers our business will be adversely affected 

any significant decline in the trading volume of our cme eurodollar or sp 500 futures and options on futures contracts would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we are substantially dependent on trading volume from two product offerings for a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits the clearing and transaction fees revenue attributable to transactions in cme eurodollar contracts and all our contracts based on the sp 500 including cme emini products approximated 46 and 26 respectively of our total clearing and transaction fees revenue during the year ended december 31 2006 and 44 and 25 respectively during the year ended december 31 2005 any significant decline in our trading volume in any of these products would negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results 

we believe our cme eurodollar futures contract serves as a global financial benchmark but we cannot assure you that in the future other products will not become preferred alternatives to our cme eurodollar contract as a means of managing or speculating on interest rate risk we also cannot assure you that competitors will not enter the eurodollar market for example in march 2004 euronextliffe began listing and trading eurodollar futures contracts our members may also elect to trade eurodollars in privately negotiated bilateral transactions without the use of our clearing house in either of these events our trading volume revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

our license agreement with standard  poor’s provides that the sp 500 index futures products will be exclusive through december 31 2008 after which we will retain our exclusive rights through december 31 2016 so long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreement with sp in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments including securities and options based on the sp indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond the jurisdictional reach of us andor our licensors 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties our financial condition will be adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our exchange or on thirdparty exchanges for which we provide processing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including our clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons we cannot guarantee you that one of our clearing 

  

firms will not default on its obligations in the future a substantial part of our surplus funds is at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its performance bond and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default additionally the default of any one of our clearing firms could cause our customers to lose confidence in our markets and the guarantee of our clearing house which would have an adverse affect on our business 

we generate significant revenue by providing processing services to third parties if we are unable to continue to realize the benefits of these agreements our revenues will be adversely impacted 

we have entered into agreements with third parties to provide processing services for which we receive significant revenue we have an agreement with cbot to provide processing services for its futures and options on futures contracts the initial term of the cbot agreement expires in january 2009 upon expiration cbot may in its sole discretion extend the agreement for an additional oneyear term we also entered into an agreement with nymex in april 2006 to be the exclusive electronic trading service provider for nymex’s energy futures and options contracts and certain of their other products on our cme globex platform the initial term of the nymex agreement is for ten years from the date of launch with rolling threeyear extensions in 2006 2005 and 2004 we generated 901 million 687 million and 559 million respectively in processing services revenue primarily from our agreement with cbot our future revenues from providing these processing services will be dependent on cbot’s trading volume and nymex’s electronic trading volume which is subject to a number of factors beyond their control as futures exchanges their ability to maintain or expand their trading volume and operate their business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject any significant decrease in cbot’s andor nymex’s trading volume will result in a corresponding decrease in our realized benefits from our processing services agreements our net income from the processing services we provide will also depend on our ability to control our costs associated with providing such services 

the terms of our processing agreements also provide that both we and the other party may terminate the agreement in some circumstances under the terms of our agreement with nymex either party between the fifth and sixth anniversary of the first launch date may terminate the contract by providing notice and paying the other party a termination fee we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be terminated prior to the end of their term or that the agreements will be renewed after their initial term or that any renewal will be on terms as favorable to us any such event could have an adverse effect on our revenues 

our market data fees may be reduced or eliminated by the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems if we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we will experience a reduction in revenue 

we sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data totaled 808 million representing 7 of our total revenues and 717 million or 8 of our total revenues during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate charges for supplying market data to trading terminals if we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals we will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost quote fee revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar events if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled for example we have experienced technical failures that resulted in a temporary suspension of trading on the cme globex platform including our most recent incident on april 26 2005 the impact of these events has not been material however we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not be material 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volume of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not–for–profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchange even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit or stop the use of our markets 

some of our largest clearing firms which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with the futures industry association have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish or seek to use alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchange even if they are not successful in their efforts the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets if any of these events occur our revenues and profits would be adversely affected 

  

we depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption in or the cessation of an important supply or service by any third party and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all would result in lost revenue and higher costs 

our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities we could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems 

we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities 

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

although the cfma significantly reduced our regulatory burdens we remain extensively regulated by the cftc our international operations may be subject to similar regulations in specific jurisdictions we are registered in a number of countries outside the united states in some cases our registrations are subject to annual review and such reviews may subject us to additional requirements in the future we may also be required to register or become subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in order to accept business from customers in those jurisdictions 

many aspects of our operations are subject to oversight and regulation by the cftc our activities relating to single stock and narrowbased stock index futures products are also subject to oversight by the sec our operations are subject to ongoing review and oversight including 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization changes in laws regulations or governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on the way we conduct our business 

the cftc has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with its rules and regulations we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations we also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the cftc or other agencies 

demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “selfregulation” that has been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program on february 1 2007 the cftc issued recommendations as to an appropriate means for designated contract markets to comply with the core principle requiring selfregulatory organizations to mitigate potential conflicts of interest the recommendations require at least 35 of the board of directors of a designated contract market to be directors with no material relationship with the exchange including memberships on the exchange currently 35 of our board of directors have no industry affiliation other than service on our board although we have not yet completed our assessment as to whether such directors would be considered to have no material relationship with the exchange for purposes of the cftc recommendation we cannot guarantee that our board will be in compliance with the recommendations to the extent we are not in compliance we will be required to demonstrate to the cftc how we otherwise met the requirements of the core principle 

  

from time to time it is proposed in congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated including a possible merger between the cftc and the sec while those proposals have not been adopted to date the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely to the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us our business could be negatively affected 

the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years which was scheduled to be completed in 2005 this process is still ongoing and could result in legislation that may have a negative impact on the way we operate our exchange including our ability to operate our selfregulatory functions or effectively compete with new entrants into our market place 

from time to time the president’s budget includes a proposal that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions while those proposals have not been adopted to date except for a percontract fee imposed under the securities exchange act of 1934 on single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits 

our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

generally the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which can be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational legal and regulatory risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks while we enjoy governmental immunity for some of our marketrelated activities we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we could be harmed by employee misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees including employees of gfx corporation our whollyowned subsidiary that primarily engages in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of cme customers or improper use of confidential information employee misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence as well as regulatory actions for example 

  

employees of gfx corporation enter into transactions to promote liquidity in cme foreign exchange contracts on the cme globex platform and subsequently enter into offsetting transactions using futures contracts or spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market to limit market risk in the event the offsetting transaction is not entered into or is not timely or properly executed we could be exposed to substantial market risk 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we have experienced significant growth in our business continued growth may require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described in the following risk factor through acquisitions or other strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

our acquisition investment and alliance strategy involves risks if we are unable to effectively manage these risks our business will be materially harmed 

to achieve our strategic objectives in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies businesses or technologies acquisitions entail numerous risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we may not be able to integrate successfully any operations personnel services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future see “additional risks relating to the proposed merger with cbot holdings” for additional risks 

we also may seek to expand or enhance some of our operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest and potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners we cannot assure you that any joint venture or alliance that we have entered into or may enter into in the future will be successful 

the imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at or otherwise offset by a fungible position existing at another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business 

in connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the cfma contemplates that clearing houses will after an initial period establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house if in the future a similar requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 

expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our operations internationally including by directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we currently have direct customer access in more than 70 countries we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 

  

   

  

  

 in addition as a result of our expanding global operations we may become subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities these may include laws rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business to date we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets we may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we rely primarily on trade secret copyright service mark trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights we have filed several patent applications covering our technology in the united states and certain other jurisdictions notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights we also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law we have copyright registrations for certain of our software user manuals and databases the copyright protection afforded to databases however is fairly limited while the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable the actual data may not be and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function in some cases including a number of our most important products there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and electronic execution services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies 

given our position as the largest futures exchange in the united states as measured by annual trading volume we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of or an indirect casualty of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations 

it is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all the threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

additional risks relating to the proposed merger with cbot holdings 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger with cbot holdings 

the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits from combining the businesses of cme holdings and cbot holdings we expect cme group to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale market integration and more automation however to realize these anticipated benefits we must successfully combine the businesses of cme holdings and cbot holdings if we are not able to achieve these objectives the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction in the amounts and times projected for a number of reasons including that the integration may take longer than anticipated be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to cme holdings’ or cbot holdings’ existing businesses 

the failure to integrate successfully the businesses and operations of cme holdings and cbot holdings in the expected time frame may adversely affect cme group’s future results 

historically cme holdings and cbot holdings have operated as independent companies and they will continue to do so until the completion of the merger the management of cme group may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of cme holdings and cbot holdings and their subsidiaries integrating their technologies organizations procedures policies and operations as well as addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel in connection with the merger cme group expects to integrate certain operations of cme and cbot including consolidating the two trading floors transitioning cbot’s electronic trading to cme’s globex platform consolidating their market data services and consolidating regulatory functions the integration will be complex and time consuming and require substantial resources and effort the integration process and other disruptions resulting from the merger may also disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with members of cme and cbot and other market participants employees regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings in addition difficulties in integrating the businesses or regulatory functions of cme holdings and cbot holdings could harm the reputation of cme group 

cme holdings and cbot holdings will incur transaction integration and restructuring costs in connection with the merger 

cme holdings and cbot holdings expect to incur significant costs associated with transaction fees professional services and other costs related to the merger specifically cme holdings and cbot holdings expect to incur approximately 62 million for transaction costs related to the merger cme group also will incur integration and restructuring costs following the completion of the merger as cme group integrates the business of cbot holdings with that of cme holdings although cme holdings and cbot holdings expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction mergerrelated and restructuring costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

completion of the merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from or the making of filings with government entities that could delay completion of the merger or impose conditions that could have a material adverse effect on cme group or that could cause abandonment of the merger 

the merger is subject to review under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended by either the antitrust division of the us department of justice or the us federal trade commission under this statute cme holdings and cbot holdings are required to make premerger notification filings and to await the expiration of the statutory waiting period prior to completing the merger on december 1 2006 cme holdings and cbot holdings each received requests for additional information or a “second request” regarding the merger from the department of justice the second request extends the initial waiting period under the statute during which the department of justice is permitted to review a proposed transaction until 30 days after the parties have substantially complied with the second request unless that period is terminated earlier by the department of justice or if the department of justice objects to the merger it obtains an injunction from a court 

  

we cannot assure you that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or if such a challenge is made that any such challenge will not be successful any such challenge may seek to impose a preliminary or permanent injunction conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger while we do not currently expect that any such preliminary or permanent injunction conditions or changes would be imposed we cannot assure you that they will not be and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on us or limiting the revenues of cme group following the merger any of which might have a material adverse effect on cme group following the merger neither cme holdings nor cbot holdings is obligated to complete the merger if any such conditions individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to result in i a material adverse effect on the expected benefits of the merger or ii a material adverse effect on cme holdings cbot holdings or cme group following the merger 

cme holdings may incur significant indebtedness in order to finance the merger which may limit cme group’s operating flexibility 

in order to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration cme holdings expects to incur incremental borrowings of up to 20 billion depending on the elections made by cbot holdings class a stockholders with respect to the merger consideration we have not obtained any commitments for the financing as of september 30 2006 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the merger assuming that cme holdings pays the maximum amount of cash available to cbot holdings class a stockholders of 30 billion cme group would have had 20 billion in indebtedness outstanding this level of indebtedness may 

 

  

  

 in addition to the extent that the credit ratings of cme group are below ratings we would have been able to obtain as a standalone company borrowing costs may increase and to the extent that the credit ratings are below investment grade the terms of the financing obligations could include restrictions such as affirmative and negative covenants conditions to borrowing subsidiary guarantees and stock pledges a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require cme group to obtain waivers from its lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on cme group’s business financial condition or results of operations

overview 

business structure 

chicago mercantile exchange holdings inc cme holdings a delaware stock corporation is the holding company for chicago mercantile exchange inc cme its primary whollyowned subsidiary and its other subsidiaries the holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility cme holdings’ class a common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq global select market under the ticker symbol “cme” 

cme which was organized in 1898 is a designated contract market for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts we are the largest futures exchange in the united states and the second largest in the world for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts as measured by 2006 annual trading volume for the second consecutive year our annual trading volume for the year surpassed one billion contracts 

futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against and potentially profiting from price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities futures contracts are legally binding standardized agreements to buy or sell a financial instrument or commodity specifying quantity and quality at a set price on a future date certain futures contracts such as commodities and foreign exchange products may result in physical delivery of the product traded other futures contracts including those for equity index and interest rate products are cash settled and do not involve physical delivery to provide additional flexibility to the investment community we also offer trading in options on futures contracts these contracts offer the customer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying futures contract at a particular price by a particular time 

we are a global exchange with customer access available in more than 70 countries our customers consist of professional traders financial institutions individual and institutional investors major corporations manufacturers producers and governments customers include both members of the exchange and nonmembers 

we offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities and alternative investments our products provide a means for hedging speculating and allocating assets we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

our major product lines are traded through our cme globex electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors both of these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house we also offer trading in cme economic derivatives which are available on the cme auction markets platform and euro and swiss francdenominated interest rate swaps which are traded on the swapstream platform 

our clearing house clears settles and guarantees every futures and options on futures contract traded through our exchange as well as those traded by the chicago board of trade cbot ownership and control of our own clearing house enables us to capture the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products ownership also enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development technology market regulation and risk management activities 

our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our exchange because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies 

  

to ensure performance of counterparties we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms and marktomarket their positions at least twice a day we also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the clearing firm to cover its payment obligation these assets include security deposits performance bonds and any other available assets such as the proceeds from the sale of pledged class a and class b common stock and associated trading rights of the clearing firm at our exchange that are owned by or assigned to the clearing firm in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of a clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use in order cme’s surplus funds security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit 

industry trends 

derivatives exchanges that provide markets for futures and options on futures have become a global growth industry with a compound annual growth rate of 43 from 2002 through june 2006 based on notional value by comparison the overthecounter otc derivatives markets have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 33 during that same period there are a number of secular trends that we believe will continue to drive growth and innovation in our industry they include 

 

  

  

  

 changing market dynamics have also led to increasing competition in all aspects of our business from both domestic and international sources we face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges otc markets and clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities and technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers 

we expect competition to continue to intensify particularly as a result of technological advances and reductions in the regulatory requirements for the development of products and markets that are competitive with our own additional factors that may intensify competition in the future include 

 

  

  

  

   

strategy 

our current strategy specifically focuses on leveraging our benchmark products scalable infrastructure and clearing and trade matching technologies to benefit customers this strategy will enable us to continue to evolve into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that offers trading and clearing solutions across additional products and asset classes our strategy includes coordinated efforts to 

 

  

  

  

 primary sources of operating revenue 

clearing and transaction fees  a majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees which include cme globex electronic trading fees surcharges for privatelynegotiated transactions and other volumerelated charges for contracts executed through our trading venues because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a percontract basis revenues and profitability fluctuate with volume changes in addition to the secular trends noted earlier our revenues and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty this is because our customers seek to manage their exposure to or speculate on the market volatility resulting from uncertainty in addition our volume is seasonal and we typically experience higher sequential volume during the first and second quarters followed by decreases in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year however these patterns may be altered by the impact of economic and political events the launch of new products and other factors 

while volume has a significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue 

 

  

  

  

 rate structure customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products we may periodically change fees volume discounts limits on fees and member discounts perhaps significantly based on our review of operations and the business environment 

as a result of their rate structure total return asset contracts trakrs auctiontraded products and swapstream products are excluded from disclosures of trading volume and average rate per contract in this discussion and analysis clearing and transaction fees on these products are immaterial relative to other cme products trakrs are exchangetraded nontraditional futures contracts that trade electronically on the cme globex electronic platform swapstream offers euro and swiss francdenominated interest rate swap products through its interdealer electronic trading platform auctiontraded products which include cme economic derivatives were introduced in september 2005 and are traded on the cme auction markets platform 

product mix we offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts on a wideranging set of products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities and alternative investments rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and support introduction of new products to encourage trading volume 

  

trading venue our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our cme globex electronic trading platform as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions any customer guaranteed by a clearing firm is able to obtain direct access to our cme globex platform open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves 

typically customers executing trades through cme globex are charged fees for using the electronic trading platform in addition to the clearing fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the clearing fees assessed on all transactions 

membernonmember mix generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers holding all other factors constant revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases and increases if the percentage of nonmember trades increases 

processing services to further diversify the range of services we offer we have entered into clearing and transaction processing agreements with other exchanges this revenue will fluctuate as the trading volume of these exchanges fluctuates 

the most significant portion of this revenue is derived from our agreement with cbot in april 2003 we entered into an agreement to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts we began to provide these services for some products in november 2003 and as of january 2004 we began to clear all cbot products the current agreement expires in january 2009 

the remaining portion of this revenue includes fees for listing energy and metal futures products on the cme globex platform for the new york mercantile exchange nymex although trading under a prior agreement with nymex ended in november 2005 trading under a new 10year agreement began on june 11 2006 we also collect fees for processing single stock futures trades for certain cme clearing firms that execute trades at onechicago llc onechicago our joint venture in single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes that initiated trading in november 2002 

quotation data fees we receive quotation data fees from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers for business and private use our market data services are provided primarily through thirdparty distributors 

subscribers can obtain access to realtime delayed and endofday quotation trade and market summary data for our products users of our basic service receive realtime quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen or device displaying our market data alternatively customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products the fee for this service is a relatively nominal flat rate per month 

pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors increases or decreases in our quotation data fees revenue is influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of subscribers general economic factors that affect the financial services industry which constitutes our primary customer base also influence revenue from our market data fees 

other sources other sources of revenue include access fees communication fees and revenue from various services related to our operations 

 

  

   

 primary operating expenses 

with the exception of license fees paid for the trading of our equity index contracts and a component of our trading facility rent that is related to open outcry trading volume most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume 

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages bonuses stockbased compensation benefits and employer taxes changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans in addition this expense is affected by the composition of our work force which includes a growing percentage of technologyrelated employees the expense associated with our bonus and stockbased compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year 

the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plan the bonus funded under the plan would be the “target” level if we achieve the cash earnings target established by the compensation committee of our board of directors cash earnings are defined as net income excluding depreciation and amortization expense and taxeffected stockbased compensation expense less capital expenditures under the plan if our actual cash earnings equal 80 of the established target for a given year the bonus will be reduced by approximately 50 of the target bonus amount there will be no bonus if our cash earnings are less than 80 of the cash earnings target other than for nonexempt employees who may receive a bonus under our discretionary bonus program if our actual cash earnings equal 120 of the target or higher the bonus would be increased by approximately 50 from the targeted bonus amount which is the maximum amount that is allowed under the plan if our performance is between the threshold performance level of 80 of the cash earnings target and the maximum performance level of 120 of the cash earnings target the bonus will be calculated based on the level of performance achieved the compensation committee may adjust the cash earnings calculation and the target level of performance for material unplanned revenue expense or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to longterm growth opportunities beginning in 2007 the cash earnings calculation for bonus purposes will exclude investment income and target levels will be adjusted accordingly 

stockbased compensation is a noncash expense related to stock options and restricted stock grants effective january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r requires the use of the fair value method of accounting for sharebased payments which we previously adopted in 2002 under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123r also requires that we estimate expected forfeitures of stock grants instead of the previous practice of accounting for forfeitures as they occurred furthermore as of january 1 2006 the excess tax benefit related to employee option exercises and restricted stock vesting has been reflected in accordance with sfas no 123r as part of cash flows from financing activities for all periods presented rather than the previous classification as part of cash flows from operating activities stockbased compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of options granted fair value is derived using the blackscholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility the riskfree interest rate and the expected life of the options granted 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of property purchased as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software this expense has increased consistently from year to year due to significant technology investments in equipment and software depreciable useful lives have remained relatively consistent since january 1 2004 

  

other expenses we incur additional expenses for communications technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 nonoperating income and expense 

investment income securities lending interest income and expense and equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries were reclassified from revenues to nonoperating income and expense in the consolidated statements of income during 2006 equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries was previously included as part of other revenues all other items appeared separately in revenues the presentation of these items has been changed to more closely conform to the securities and exchange commission’s article 5 of regulation sx 

 

  

   

 critical accounting policies 

the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies in establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states management must make certain assessments estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical these critical policies which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements relate to revenue recognition income taxes internal use software costs stockbased compensation and goodwill and intangible assets 

revenue recognition  our revenue recognition policies comply with staff accounting bulletin no 101 on revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared on occasion the customer’s exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts when this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm an accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges the accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests occasionally market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment when these circumstances occur revenue is recognized as services are provided 

income taxes  calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years as determined in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” as required by the provisions of sfas no 109 our deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if all assets will be realized in future periods to the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized the assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance the calculation of our tax provision involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other applicable tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if payment of these amounts varies from our estimate our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made this determination may not be known for several years past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed the effective tax rate defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes will vary from year to year based on changes to tax rates and regulations in addition the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax such as municipal interest income and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses 

internal use software costs  certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” costs capitalized are for application development or implementation as required by sop 981 for software projects that will result in significant new functionality and that are generally expected to cost in excess of 05 million the amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible softwarerelated activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria of sop 981 and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project completed internal use software projects as well as workinprogress projects are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets once 

completed the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software generally three years costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from yeartoyear based on our technologyrelated business requirements 

  

stockbased compensation  we expense stock options using the fair value method under the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” we have elected the accelerated method for recognizing the expense related to stock grants due to this election and the vesting provisions of our stock grants a greater percentage of the total expense is recognized in the first and second years of the vesting period than would be recorded if we used the straightline method upon adoption of sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 we began to include an estimate of expected forfeitures of stock grants in our expense recognition calculations instead of the previous practice of accounting for forfeitures as they occur 

goodwill and intangible assets  we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the provisions of sfas no 142 require that a twostep impairment test be performed on goodwill in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicated by a change in circumstances pursuant to sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value the estimate of the fair value of the assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows in estimating the fair value management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows future revenues future earnings and other factors such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements and prescribes that a company should use a morelikelythannot recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken the interpretation also provides guidance on recognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin no 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 with any cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings we will adopt fin no 48 effective january 1 2007 we expect no material impact on our financial statements upon initial adoption 

results of operations for 2006 compared with 2005 

2006 financial highlights 

 

  

  

  

   

revenues 

 

 revenue highlights  revenues grew in 2006 primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

 clearing and transaction fees the increase was due to trading volume growth partially offset by a decrease in the average rate per contract the following table summarizes average daily trading volume in thousands and revenue all amounts exclude trakrs cme auction markets and swapstream products 

 

   

 in 2006 our volume surpassed one billion contracts traded for the second consecutive year driven by growth of 25 or more in all product lines technology enhancements including the migration of our cme globex trading platform to new hewlett packard integrity nonstop servers that incorporate intel itanium processors significantly increased tradematching speed which reduced our average response time on transactions and resulted in increased usage by automated trading systems growth in hedge funds interest rate uncertainty and occasional daily volatility in equity markets also contributed to trading volume growth 

  

interest rate products 

interest rate product volume increased in 2006 primarily due to uncertain market expectations surrounding interest rates including those created by changes in federal reserve monetary policy expansion in the use of our electronic trading platform as a result of technological enhancement and increased use of automated trading systems the volume of interest rate products traded electronically increased by 34 to 18 million contracts per day in 2006 secular trends favoring the trading of derivative products also contributed to the increase in volume 

the average daily volume of cme eurodollar options which are traded predominantly through open outcry increased by 44 to 11 million contracts in 2006 in conjunction with the increase in eurodollar options volume the average daily volume of cme eurodollar options traded electronically also increased to 77000 contracts in 2006 from 28000 contracts in 2005 in april 2006 we launched a new incentive program to increase electronic trading of cme eurodollar options the program which was initially effective through december 2006 has been extended through june 2007 the program provides a reduced fee schedule for customers meeting percentage thresholds for electronic trading of cme eurodollar options 

equity products 

the increase in equity product volume for the year was primarily due to technological enhancements increased usage of equity option products occasional significant daily fluctuations in stock market volatility as measured by the cboe volatility index and efforts to attract new customers 

average daily volume of our emini equity products increased by 25 to 16 million contracts in 2006 compared with 2005 in particular emini sp 500 volume increased 27 to 11 million contracts volume for our electronically traded emini equity options increased to 45000 contracts per day in 2006 from 18000 contracts per day in 2005 

foreign exchange products 

in december 2006 foreign exchange volume set a monthly volume record with 621000 contracts traded per day the increase in trading of foreign exchange products resulted from the previously mentioned technological enhancements which facilitated faster execution of trades additional liquidity and fee incentive programs including those specifically targeted to attract commodity trading advisors and large hedge funds in 2006 88 of our foreign exchange volume traded through the cme globex platform compared with 81 during 2005 

commodity and alternative investment products 

trading in commodity and alternative investment products increased as a result of the growing appeal of commodities as an asset class which has attracted additional trading activity in live cattle and lean hog products 

 

 the impact of the 28 increase in average daily trading volume during 2006 was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate or revenue per contract in 2006 the average rate per contract decreased 3 to 0645 from 0664 in 2005 primarily due to the following factors 

 

  

  

   

 these decreases were partially offset by broadbased pricing increases implemented in august 2005 which contributed incremental revenue of approximately 130 million when compared with 2005 additionally the rate per contract was favorably impacted by a higher percentage of trades executed through the cme globex platform for which additional fees are assessed 

a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees are billed to our clearing firms the majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers we currently have approximately 85 clearing firms no one firm represented 10 or more of clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2006 should a clearing firm discontinue operations we believe the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange therefore we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from the loss of revenue earned from any particular firm 

processing services revenue increased primarily as a result of increased trading volume at cbot and higher volume executed on the cme globex platform under our new agreement with nymex 

cbot’s average daily trading volume was 32 million contracts for 2006 an increase of 20 over the 27 million contracts traded in 2005 increased volume at cbot generated incremental revenue of 116 million in 2006 

revenue from services provided to nymex increased by 98 million in 2006 when compared with 2005 our prior agreement with nymex ended in november 2005 trading under our new 10year agreement began in june 2006 the new agreement added metals futures products and expanded the number of energy futures products including the addition of physically delivered wti futures products which we now list for nymex on the cme globex platform as a result the average daily volume of nymex electronic trading increased significantly on our platform during 2006 

quotation data fees the growth in revenue resulted primarily from a fee increase that was implemented on january 1 2006 users of our basic service paid 40 per month for each market data screen or device in 2006 the monthly charge in effect during 2005 was 35 this higher rate contributed to a 104 million increase in subscriber fees for 2006 compared with 2005 and was partially offset by a 15 million decrease in assessments which result from our periodic audits of usage data previously provided by our customers 

during 2006 approximately 55 of our quotation data fees revenue was generated from the two largest resellers of our market data despite this concentration we do not believe we are exposed to a significant risk of revenue loss in the event one of these vendors no longer subscribed to our market data we believe the majority of the vendor’s customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller 

effective january 1 2007 users of our basic service will pay 50 per month for each market data screen or device 

access fees growth in revenue resulted from the expiration in july 2006 of an incentive program to encourage our customers to switch to a higher bandwidth connection 

  

expenses 

 

 expense highlights increases in total expenses for 2006 were primarily driven by the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 in 2007 we expect operating expenses to total 5300 to 5400 million this includes swapstreamrelated expenditures mergerrelated planning costs and costs associated with agreements to provide various services to fxms 

compensation and benefits the increase in compensation and benefits expense during 2006 relative to 2005 consisted primarily of the following 

 

  

  

  

   

 technology support services we experienced growth of 20 in the average number of transactions processed electronically during 2006 when compared with 2005 as a result of the continued growth in transactions processed additional maintenance and service contracts were required to support increases in hardware and software purchases 

professional fees and outside services legal fees increased 41 million in 2006 when compared with 2005 due primarily to the structuring and establishment of fxms and litigation costs related to the ongoing antitrust lawsuit filed by eurex us in 2003 

in addition other professional fees increased 34 million in 2006 primarily due to the use of consulting services to support several clearing and trading systems projects as well as enhancements to the cme globex platform’s functionality including its ability to execute complex options trading strategies during the fourth quarter mergerrelated integration planning also contributed to an increase in professional fees we expect mergerrelated integration planning to continue throughout 2007 

depreciation and amortization during the second quarter of 2006 we began an 18month process of migrating the electronic trading of products to new hewlett packard integrity nonstop servers that incorporate intel itanium processors as a result of the migration we reassessed and shortened the estimated useful lives on our existing processors which resulted in additional depreciation expense of 19 million in 2006 when compared with 2005 in addition depreciation and amortization of 2005 and 2006 property additions exceeded the depreciation and amortization of assets that have become fully depreciated or retired since january 1 2005 resulting in an increase in 2006 depreciation and amortization expense 

property additions for 2006 and 2005 are summarized below technologyrelated assets include purchases of computers and related equipment software the cost of developing internal use software and costs associated with the expansion of our data centers 

 

 occupancy we entered into two new leases for additional space in chicago and london during 2006 the chicago lease which began in august 2006 will provide us with an opportunity to reorganize and maximize the utilization of our facilities in the downtown area the london lease which began in november 2006 will allow us to consolidate our existing london office with swapstream’s facilities the new leases resulted in additional rent expense of 11 million in 2006 

licensing and other fee agreements a large portion of the increase in this expense was attributable to an increase in licensing rates for sp emini products and to a lesser extent nasdaq emini products rate increases went into effect in june 2005 for nasdaq products and september 2005 for sp products in return for extending our exclusive rights to offer these products renegotiated licensing rates resulted in 65 million of incremental expense compared with 2005 also higher average daily trading volume for licensed products resulted in additional expense of 24 million in 2006 higher volumes were primarily attributable to sp 500 and nasdaq 100 emini products 

these increases in expense were partially offset by a 09 million decrease in fees paid to market maker program participants the reduction in market maker fees was primarily due to the expiration of the russell 1000 program in december 2005 

effective february 5 2007 our eurodollar fee sharing agreement with sgx will terminate resulting in an estimated decrease in expense of approximately 33 million in 2007 

  

marketing advertising and public relations in 2006 this expense increased primarily as a result of the preparation for and launch of a new global brand advertising campaign the promotion of new products and production of cme’s quarterly magazine which launched in the third quarter of 2005 also contributed to an increase in expense 

nonoperating income and expense 

 

 investment income rising market interest rates as well as increased funds available for investment resulted in increased investment income in 2006 when compared with 2005 increases in investment income were partially offset by an increase in taxadvantaged investments as a percentage of the total portfolio during 2006 the annualized average rate of return and average investment balance indicated in the table below include shortterm investments classified as cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits but exclude the first iefs and our nonqualified deferred compensation plan nonqualified deferred compensation plan earnings are excluded from this analysis as there is an equal and offsetting amount in compensation and benefits expense 

 

 increases due to rate and balance changes were partially offset by a decrease of 19 million resulting from the discontinuance of the first iefs in december 2005 

securities lending interest income and expense the average daily balance of funds available for lending increased during 2006 relative to 2005 this was primarily the result of a policy change effective october 1 2005 that increased the amount of securities available for lending to 70 from 50 of total eligible securities 

 

 equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries this includes 61 million of losses from our investment in fxms which was formed in july 2006 as well as our proportionate share of losses from onechicago 

  

income tax provision 

in 2006 the effective tax rate decreased from 396 to 394 when compared with 2005 the decrease is due primarily to increased investments in taxadvantaged securities the impact of which was partially offset by the effect of a valuation allowance for the net operating losses generated by our swapstream operations subsequent to the acquisition in august 2006 

results of operations for 2005 compared with 2004 

2005 financial highlights 

 

  

  

  

  

 revenues 

 

 revenue highlights  total revenues increased by 23 primarily as a result of the following factors 

 

  

  

  

 clearing and transaction fees a significant portion of the increase in clearing and transaction fees in 2005 was attributable to the 34 increase in average daily trading volume in 2005 we set annual volume records in our four major product lines and for the first time ever the total annual volume of our products surpassed one billion contracts compared with our previous record of 787 million contracts in 2004 in addition there was an increase in the percentage of trading volume executed through the cme globex platform in 2005 cme globex volume was 70 of average daily trading volume compared with 57 during 2004 all of our product lines experienced growth in cme globex volume during 2005 when compared with 2004 

  

the following table summarizes average daily trading volume in thousands and revenue all amounts exclude trakrs and auctiontraded products 

 

   

 interest rate products 

we experienced an increase in our interest rate volume in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

 the average daily volume of interest rate products traded electronically increased from 594000 contracts in 2004 to 13 million contracts in 2005 with 57 of interest rate volume executed on the cme globex platform compared with 35 in 2004 

equity products 

trading volume for our equity products increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in our cme emini products due to increased distribution to new users this was achieved despite volatility in the us equity markets that was 17 lower in 2005 when compared with 2004 as measured by the cboe volatility index during 2005 average daily volume of cme emini products increased by 21 to 13 million contracts when compared with 2004 the strongest growth in average daily volume occurred in cme emini sp 500 futures which increased by 02 million contracts cme emini russell 2000 futures and cme emini sp midcap 400 futures we also experienced growth in our emini equity option products 

foreign exchange products 

our foreign exchange volume has benefited from increased demand from automated trading systems driven primarily by technology enhancements that allow faster execution we also experienced volume growth from commodity trading advisors and large hedge funds as a result of initiatives implemented in 2005 fee incentive programs initiated during the second quarter of 2004 also resulted in increased trading on the cme globex platform in 2005 81 of our foreign exchange volume was executed through cme globex compared with 66 in 2004 

  

 partially offsetting the impact of the increase in trading volume on revenue was a decrease in the average rate or revenue per contract the average rate per contract decreased to 0664 for 2005 from 0702 in 2004 primarily due to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition to the change in the rate structure in 2005 we also extended the european and asian incentive programs and the electronic corporate membership program through december 31 2006 in 2005 we implemented two oneyear incentive programs designed to attract large hedge funds and commodity trading advisors to our foreign exchange markets we also launched a new emerging markets partner program to support the geographic expansion of european and usbased proprietary trading firms and trading arcades into developing trading centers this twoyear program provides fee waivers for new users of our electronic markets in qualified regions around the world 

processing services the increase was primarily the result of increased volume at cbot as well as the expiration of lower initial pricing for that service that was in effect during much of 2004 we cleared 675 million cbot contracts during 2005 compared with 600 million contracts during 2004 in addition we earned 38 million in incremental revenue from our agreement with nymex due to increased trading volume and related increased fees for these trades trading volume related to nymex increased to 52 million contracts in 2005 from 09 million contracts in 2004 our agreement with nymex expired and we stopped listing nymex products on the cme globex platform as of november 18 2005 we entered into a new agreement with nymex in june 2006 

quotation data fees the increase in quotation data fees resulted primarily from the rate change that was implemented on january 1 2005 users of our basic service pay 35 per month for each market data screen or device an increase from the 30 per month charge that was in effect during 2004 in addition there was an increase of 09 million related to assessments resulting from our periodic audits of the usage data provided by our customers 

access fees the increase in access fees was attributed primarily to cme globex users converting to higher bandwidth connections at a higher fee beginning in the third quarter of 2004 

communication fees communication fees decreased primarily as a result of reduced demand for communication devices and services on the trading floor accompanied by a decrease in demand by our building tenants 

  

expenses 

 

 expense highlights while there was a 23 increase in total revenues in 2005 total expenses increased by 13 driven primarily by the following factors 

 

  

  

  

  

 compensation and benefits although there are a number of factors that affected compensation and benefits the primary drivers of the increase were 

 

  

  

  

 communications during 2005 we experienced greater communications expense of 44 million this increase is related to a number of items including but not limited to expansion of our international communications hubs in europe and asia we now have seven hubs in europe and one in asia in addition our bandwidth upgrades for customers increased connections for new cme globex users and additional bandwidth now provided between our main location and our remote data centers also contributed to the increase in communications expense 

  

technology support services the number of transactions we processed electronically increased approximately 39 in 2005 as a result additional capital purchases were required to accommodate this growth and our expenses for software software maintenance and hardware maintenance increased 51 million when compared with 2004 

professional fees and outside services we incurred 25 million in additional professional fees net of amounts capitalized for internally developed software that related primarily to our technology initiatives including integration of enhanced options trading functionality onto the cme globex platform and implementation of new mass quoting functionality for certain foreign exchange and equity option products partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of 07 million in other professional fees and outside services primarily due to reduced legal fees and recruiting expenses 

depreciation and amortization this increase was the result of depreciation and amortization of 2005 asset acquisitions exceeding the depreciation and amortization of assets that have become fully depreciated or retired since december 31 2004 the main components of the 2005 asset additions were technology equipment and leasehold improvements to our remote data centers also a greater portion of our fixed assets are now depreciating over shorter lives this change became effective january 1 2004 when the estimated useful lives of new technology equipment purchases were reduced from four to three years and new personal computer purchases were reduced from three to two years 

property additions for 2005 and 2004 are summarized below technologyrelated assets include purchases of computers and related equipment software the cost of developing internal use software and costs associated with the buildout of our data centers 

 

 licensing and other fee agreements the increase resulted primarily from 35 million in additional license fees in 2005 when compared with 2004 as a result of increased licensing rates for certain of our equity products and increased trading volume the nasdaq and sp licensing agreements were renegotiated in april 2005 and september 2005 respectively rates increased for these licensing agreements as a result of the renegotiations in return for an extension of exclusivity additionally we incurred 23 million of incremental expense related to our revenue sharing agreements with sgx and market makers designated for certain products the sgx increase resulted from the growth in electronic trading of cme eurodollar contracts after our regular floor trading hours 

marketing advertising and public relations the increase in marketing advertising and public relations expense is attributable to increased productspecific marketing especially for our foreign exchange products the launch of cme magazine and rebranding of brochures and direct marketing materials during 2005 we also incurred 04 million of expense related to a donation for hurricane relief there was no similar expense in 2004 

nonoperating income and expense 

 

    

investment income the increase is primarily a result of interest rate increases in the marketplace also funds available for investment continued to increase in large part due to growth in net income 

 

 offsetting these increases was a 04 million decrease in ief interest income and other investment income the first iefs were included in our consolidated financial statements until they were discontinued in december 2005 

securities lending interest income and expense in october 2005 we increased the amount of eligible securities available for lending to 70 from 50 in addition throughout 2005 the balance of firm securities held that were eligible for securities lending increased both of these items as well as the continued increase in interest rates by the federal open market committee of the federal reserve had a significant impact on securities lending interest year over year 

 

 income tax provision 

the effective tax rate was 396 for 2005 compared with 403 for 2004 the effective tax rate declined as a result of an increase in taxadvantaged investments and the favorable resolution of certain tax audit issues 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements 

historically we have met our funding requirements from operations if operations do not provide sufficient funds to meet capital expenditure requirements cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities can be reduced to provide the needed funds assets can be acquired through capital leases or we can issue debt in addition we believe we can fund any pending or potential future acquisitions with internally available cash debt financing or the issuance of equity securities 

on october 17 2006 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with cbot holdings inc this proposed merger is subject to an affirmative vote by cme holdings’ and cbot holdings’ stockholders and cbot members normal regulatory approvals and other closing conditions pursuant to the terms of the agreement cbot holdings’ shareholders will have the right to receive 03006 shares of cme holdings class a common stock per share of cbot holdings class a common stock or to elect an amount in cash equal to the value of the exchange ratio based on a ten day average of closing prices of our class a common stock at the time of the merger however the maximum amount of cash available for all cbot holdings’ shareholders is 30 billion upon the closing of the transaction which is expected to occur in mid2007 we will need up to approximately 31 billion to purchase the shares of cbot holdings’ shareholders electing to receive cash and to pay estimated fees and expenses related to the transaction we expect to fund the transaction with cash and cash equivalents proceeds from expected maturities of our marketable securities and various short and longterm debt facilities as needed based on the amount of the cash election made by cbot holdings’ shareholders if either cme holdings or cbot holdings were to terminate the merger agreement the terminating party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of 2400 million and to reimburse the other party for expenses up to 60 million 

  

cash will also be required for operating leases and noncancelable purchase obligations as well as commitments reflected as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2006 these commitments are as follows in thousands 

 

 future operating lease commitments at december 31 2006 increased from yearend 2005 primarily as a result of two new operating leases to obtain additional office space in chicago and london 

future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to invest in increased system capacity and performance and pursue technological initiatives on our electronic trading platform such as implementation of additional functionality for cme eurodollar and foreign exchange options increased functionality for more user defined spreads and other facilitation of options and futures trading each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements throughout our central location and our remote data centers capital expenditures also are incurred for improvements to our trading floor facilities offices telecommunications capabilities and other operating equipment we expect 2007 capital expenditures to total approximately 1100 million excluding leasehold improvements for our new office space that will be funded with landlord allowances anticipated capital expenditures for 2007 include approximately 200 million of data center buildout costs related to our pending merger with and integration of cbot holdings 

we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders in 2006 our annual dividend target remained at approximately 30 of the prior year’s cash earnings the decision to pay a dividend however remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors including our earnings financial condition capital requirements level of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant on january 31 2007 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 086 per share payable on march 26 2007 to shareholders of record on march 9 2007 assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding the march 2007 dividend payment will total approximately 300 million 

sources and uses of cash 

net cash provided by operating activities was 4717 million for 2006 and 3482 million for 2005 the net cash provided by operations increased primarily as a result of our improved operating results this increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and deferred taxes the net cash provided by operating activities exceeded our net income in 2006 and 2005 primarily as a result of noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization which do not adversely affect our cash flow 

cash used in investing activities was 859 million for 2006 compared with 823 million for 2005 even though there was a reduction of 404 million in the purchases of marketable securities in 2006 additional cash was used for the purchase of swapstream and the investment in fxms which were 177 million and 139 million respectively these factors resulted in a slight increase in cash used of 35 million 

property additions include capital expenditures of purchased and internally developed software and leasehold improvements including those acquired with lease allowances property additions in 2006 include leasehold improvements of 80 million related to the expansion of our remote data centers 73 million related to the remodeling of the office space at our main location and 05 

  

million related to remodeling of our new office space in chicago property additions in 2005 included leasehold improvements of 228 million related to the expansion of our remote data centers and 58 million related to the remodeling of the office space at our main location 

technologyrelated assets include purchases of computers and related equipment software the cost of developing internal use software and costs associated with the buildout and expansion of our data centers technologyrelated additions increased 02 million to 797 million in 2006 from 795 million in 2005 these additions related primarily to expanding capacity to accommodate the growth in electronic trading on the cme globex platform clearing trades for cbot listing trades for nymex improving speed and reliability in our systems and implementing other system enhancements 

cash used in financing activities was 272 million in 2006 compared with 126 million in 2005 the increase was primarily due to the 242 million increase in dividends paid dividends totaled 875 million in 2006 compared with 633 million in 2005 the increase resulted primarily from our improved prior year’s cash earnings which is the basis used to determine the amount of the current year’s dividend partially offsetting this increase was an increase of 85 million in proceeds from options exercised

we maintain a line of credit with a consortium of banks to be used in certain situations such as disruption in the domestic payment system that would delay settlement between our exchange and our clearing firms or in the event of a clearing firm default in order to ensure that the facility would operate as intended cme periodically draws down nominal amounts of funds against the letter of credit and immediately repays the amounts borrowed on october 13 2006 the line of credit was renewed and the amount of the revolving line of credit was increased from 7500 million to 8000 million with terms substantially the same as the expiring line of credit we have the option to request an increase to the facility from 8000 million to 10 billion at the time of a draw subject to the approval of the participating banks the credit agreement continues to be collateralized by clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as security deposit funds in ief2 and any performance bond deposits of the defaulting firm the line of credit can only be drawn on to the extent it is collateralized collateral available and on deposit was 12 billion at december 31 2006 

in october 2005 we approved the use of cmeowned us treasury securities as performance bond collateral in lieu of or in combination with irrevocable letters of credit for our mutual offset agreement with sgx we can pledge us treasury securities up to a maximum of 1000 million measured as the aggregate fair value at the time of the most recent collateral adjustment at december 31 2006 we were contingently liable on irrevocable letters of credit totaling 190 million and had pledged securities with a fair value of 1007 million 

cme also guarantees a 50 million standby letter of credit for gfx the beneficiary of the letter of credit is the clearing firm that is used by gfx to execute and maintain its futures positions the letter of credit will be utilized in the event that gfx defaults in meeting performance bond requirements to its clearing firm in the unlikely event of a payment default by gfx gfx’s performance bond deposits would first be used to cover any deficit if this amount is not sufficient the letter of credit would be used and finally cme would guarantee the remaining deficit if any 

offbalance sheet arrangements

liquidity and cash management

each clearing firm is required to deposit and maintain a specified performance bond balance which is determined by parameters established by the risk management department of the clearing house and may fluctuate over time performance bond requirements can be satisfied with a variety of approved investments and cash cash performance bonds and security deposits are included in our consolidated balance sheets with the exception of the portion of securities deposited that are utilized in our securities lending program clearing firm deposits other than those retained in the form of cash are not included in our consolidated balance sheets securities lending transactions utilize a portion of the securities that clearing firms have deposited to satisfy their proprietary performance bond requirements securities lending activity fluctuates based on the amount of securities that clearing firms have deposited and the demand for securities lending activity in the particular securities available to us as a result of these factors the balances in cash performance bonds and security deposits as well as the balances in our securities lending program may fluctuate significantly over time 

cash performance bonds and security deposits and collateral from securities lending consisted of the following at december 31 

 

 we are required under the commodity exchange act to segregate cash and securities deposited by clearing firms on behalf of customers in addition our exchange rules require a segregation of all funds and securities deposited by clearing firms from exchange operating funds and marketable securities as with cash performance bonds and security deposits these balances will fluctuate due to the investment choices available to clearing firms and the change in total deposits required securities at fair value and ief funds were deposited for the following purposes at december 31

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are subject to various market risks including those caused by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk our investment policy is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the investment of available funds investments typically include money market mutual funds municipal securities and us treasury and government agency securities with fixed or variable rate terms under our investment policy we monitor interest rate risk by completing regular reviews of our marketable securities portfolio and its sensitivity to changes in the general level of interest rates commonly referred to as a portfolio’s duration we control the duration of the portfolio primarily through the purchase of individual marketable securities having a duration consistent with our overall investment policy in addition we will generally hold marketable securities to maturity which will act as a further mitigating factor to interest rate risk under our investment policy the aggregate portfolio duration cannot exceed 24 months 

a change in market interest rates would affect interest income as well as the fair value of investments all of our investments are carried at fair value interest income from shortterm cash investments marketable securities and cash performance bonds and security deposits was 538 million and 285 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively our marketable securities portfolio experienced a decrease in net unrealized losses of 21 million in 2006 and an increase in net unrealized losses of 21 million in 2005 there were no realized gains or losses from sales of marketable securities in either period 

expected maturities and interest coupon rates for marketable securities all of which were fixedrate securities were as follows at december 31 2006 dollars in thousands 

 

 the 2008 expected maturities include 267 million in principal amount of zero coupon marketable securities excluding zero coupon securities the 2008 weighted average interest rate would be 351 and the total weighted average interest rate would be 371 

  

foreign exchange risk gfx engages primarily in the purchase and sale of our foreign exchange futures contracts on the cme globex platform to provide additional liquidity in these products gfx subsequently enters into offsetting transactions using futures contracts or spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market to limit its market risk any potential impact on the earnings of gfx from a change in foreign exchange rates would not be significant net intraday position limits which are established for each trader totaled 120 million in aggregate notional value as of december 31 2006 

at december 31 2006 gfx held futures positions with a notional value of 1118 million offset by a similar amount of spot foreign exchange positions the notional value of futures positions at december 31 2005 totaled 1066 million all positions are marked to market on a daily basis using our foreign exchange settlement prices with resulting gain or loss reflected in other revenues net trading gains were 70 million and 76 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively

 item 1 business tableend general 

we are the largest futures exchange in the united states for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts often called derivatives as measured by 2005 annual trading volume for the first time ever the yearly trading volume of our products surpassed one billion contracts we posted record trading volume of 10 billion contracts in 2005 an increase of 33 over 2004 which was previously our busiest year in 2005 our customers who include our members traded futures contracts and options on futures contracts with an underlying value of 638 trillion making us the world’s largest exchange by this measure we also have the largest futures and options on futures open interest of any futures exchange in the world as of december 31 2005 our open interest record was 393 million contracts set on december 15 2005 open interest is the number of outstanding contracts at the close of the trading day at the exchange and is a leading indicator of liquidity liquidity of markets or the ability of a market to quickly and efficiently absorb the execution of large purchases or sales is a key to attracting customers and contributing to a market’s success 

futures and options on futures provide a way to protect against – and potentially profit from – price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities futures contracts are legally binding agreements to buy or sell something in the future such as livestock or foreign currency the buyer and seller of a futures contract agree on a price today for a product to be delivered and paid for in the future each contract specifies the quantity of the item and the time of delivery or payment 

our products provide a means for hedging speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with interest rate sensitive instruments equity ownership changes in the value of foreign currency and changes in the prices of commodities our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers supranational entities and governments 

as a marketplace for global risk management our exchange brings together buyers and sellers of derivatives products which trade on our cme globex electronic trading platform on our trading floors through open outcry and via privately 

  

negotiated transactions that we clear we offer market participants the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities and alternative investments our key products include cme eurodollar contracts and contracts based on major us stock indexes including the sp 500 and the nasdaq100 we also offer contracts for the principal foreign currencies and for a number of commodity products including cattle hogs and dairy we believe several of our key products serve as global financial benchmarks for example our cme eurodollar futures contract provides a benchmark for measuring the relative value of us dollardenominated shortterm fixedincome securities similarly our sp 500 and nasdaq100 index contracts are closely linked to the benchmark indexes for us equity market performance 

we own our clearing house which is the largest derivatives clearing operation in the world for futures and options on futures and we clear settle and guarantee every contract traded through our exchange as a result of our agreement to provide clearing and related services to the chicago board of trade or the cbot we now clear approximately 90 of all futures contracts and options on futures contracts in the united states our systems are scalable and give us the ability to increase our capacity with little lead time our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and half times our historical peak transactions on august 31 2005 we processed a record of approximately 24 million transactions as of december 31 2005 we acted as custodian for approximately 458 billion in performance bond collateral including approximately 32 billion in deposits for noncme products in 2005 we moved an average of 17 billion of settlement funds through our clearing system each day in addition 52 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide have adopted our span risk evaluation system which is used to determine the appropriate performance bond requirements for trading portfolios 

cme was founded in 1898 as a notforprofit corporation in november 2000 we demutualized and became a shareholderowned corporation as a consequence we adopted a forprofit approach to our business including strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing volume efficiency and liquidity in december 2002 cme holdings completed its initial public offering of its class a common stock and became the first us financial exchange to be publicly traded 

we have a history of innovation in our industry in the 1960s we introduced the first livestock futures contract that resulted in the physical delivery of live cattle in 1972 we introduced the world’s first financial futures contracts when we launched seven foreign exchange futures contracts that innovation fundamentally changed the nature and scope of futures markets transforming them from agricultural hedging mechanisms to hedging and risk management markets for financial instruments and financial risks we also developed the first cashsettled futures in 1981 with the introduction of cme eurodollar futures which is one of the world’s most actively traded futures contracts cash settlement also enabled us to introduce in 1982 the first successful stock index futures contract the sp 500 in 1987 we pioneered the concept of global electronic trading of derivatives contracts and we subsequently launched the cme globex electronic trading platform in 1992 today most of our products trade electronically as well as on our open outcry trading floors in 1997 we introduced the first of the cme emini stock index products which are smallersized electronically traded versions of our benchmark stock index futures contracts in april 2003 we entered into an agreement with the cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures contracts and options on futures contracts 

we offer an innovative and diverse product line for example in 2005 we expanded our product offerings to include options on our emini russell 2000 futures contracts cashsettled butter futures our first electronically traded cashsettled dairy futures contract ethanol futures our first electronic energy contract and cme economic derivatives which are products based on economic data that trade in cme auction markets in 2006 we also announced plans to launch futures on the sp asia 50 index the only panasian equity index emini futures on the msci eafe index the preeminent benchmark for measuring international stock market performance and futures based on ten of the case shiller indexes representing movements in housing price values 

trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by our members our members are individual traders as well as most of the world’s largest banks brokerages and investment houses prior to the introduction of our electronic trading platform our members traded only on our open outcry trading floors and through privately negotiated transactions today our members are able to conduct trading on our open outcry trading floors electronically on the cme globex platform and through privately negotiated transactions that we clear in 2005 our members were responsible for nearly 79 of our total trading volume 

prior to our demutualization direct access to our markets whether on our open outcry trading floors or through the cme globex platform was limited to members and those with an exchange permit who met specified qualifications in connection with our demutualization we opened access to our markets by allowing unlimited direct access to the cme globex platform for all market participants today any individual or institutional customer guaranteed by a clearing firm is able to obtain direct access to the cme globex platform as a result of the increased access to our markets all market participants now have the ability to view bids and offers in the market generally member customers are charged lower fees 

  

than our nonmember customers certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to encourage increased liquidity in our markets in 2005 volume on the cme globex electronic trading platform represented 70 of our trading volume compared with 57 in 2004

competitive strengths 

we have established ourselves as a premier global marketplace for financial risk management we believe our principal competitive strengths are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 highly liquid markets the liquidity in our markets is a key factor in attracting and retaining customers we have the largest open interest of any futures exchange in the world as of december 31 2005 our open interest record was 393 million contracts set on december 15 2005 during 2005 we posted record trading volume of 10 billion contracts an increase of 33 over 2004 making us the largest exchange in the united states and the second largest in the world for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts during that period 

global benchmark products we believe our key products serve as global benchmarks for valuing and managing risk our cme eurodollar futures contract serves as a global benchmark for measuring the relative value of us dollardenominated shortterm fixedincome securities similarly the sp 500 nasdaq100 and russell indexes are considered primary tools for benchmarking investment performance against us equity market exposure our sp 500 nasdaq100 and russell index contracts which are based on these benchmarks are recognized by our customers as efficient tools for managing and hedging their equity risks 

diverse portfolio of products and services we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing and offering to our customers a diverse array of products as well as a broad range of trade execution and clearing services we have a long history of developing innovative products based on interest rates equities foreign exchange and commodities designed to appeal to institutional and individual customers we offer both open outcry auction trading and electronic ordermatching services and we provide facilities to clear privately negotiated transactions our markets provide important risk management tools to our customers which include leading global and financial institutions we work closely with our customers to create markets and products that meet their needs these relationships help us to anticipate and lead industry changes 

wholly owned clearing house we own our clearing house which clears settles and guarantees every contract traded through our exchange and futures and options on futures contracts traded through the cbot our scalable systems give us the ability to further increase our capacity with little lead time our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and half times our historical peak transactions on august 31 2005 we processed a record of approximately 24 million transactions in january 2004 we fully implemented our agreement with the cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures contracts and options on futures contracts in 2005 our clearing house cleared an average of 70 million contracts daily and 18 billion contracts overall as of december 31 2005 we acted as custodian for approximately 458 billion in performance bond collateral including approximately 32 billion in deposits for noncme products and in 2005 moved an average of 17 billion of settlement funds through our clearing system each day we believe our performance guarantee is a major attraction to our markets particularly compared to the overthecounter or otc markets because it substantially reduces counterparty risk our clearing system permits more efficient use of capital for our customers by allowing netting of long and short positions in a single type of contract and providing risk offset and crossmargining arrangements with several other leading clearing houses in addition ownership of our clearing house enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development technology market 

  

regulation and other risk management activities our goal is to design our system to service historical peak volumes provide clearing services to the cbot and other exchanges and clear new products with high volume potential 

proven and scalable technology we believe our ability to use technology effectively has been a key factor in the successful development of our business as a result of significant investments in our technology asset base we possess fast reliable and fully integrated trading and clearing systems our goal is to design our highly scalable systems to accommodate additional products with relatively limited modifications and low incremental costs the core components of our system infrastructure for trading clearing and risk management are becoming widely adopted throughout the futures industry resulting in common interfaces and efficiencies for intermediaries and customers for example our cme span risk evaluation system has been adopted by 52 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide 

global reach globalization of financial markets is expanding the customer base for futures products beyond traditional boundaries our electronic trading services which are available nearly 24 hours a day and five days per week position us to take advantage of this development in addition in 2005 we expanded our telecommunications capacity with the addition of a hub in singapore similar to our other seven hubs previously established in europe these hubs reduce connectivity costs and house direct electronic connections between the foreign customer and cme globex our electronic trading platform we also introduced incentive programs for certain types of customers in europe asia and other emerging regions such as india south africa poland russia and israel these programs have fueled our global expansion by attracting new customers to our products and markets worldwide we now have direct customer access to our exchange in over 70 countries 

growth strategy 

globalization deregulation and advances in technology offer significant opportunities for expanding futures markets and exchange markets generally we intend to increase our trading volumes revenues and profitability by capitalizing on these opportunities through implementation of the following four strategies 

 

  

  

  

 expand our current core business we intend to advance our position as a leader in the futures industry by expanding customer access to our markets and services offering additional trade execution choices and enhancing our market data and information products 

 

  

   

  

 add new products we develop new products and product line extensions based on research and development in collaboration with our customers in 2005 we launched eurozone hicp futures european style options on cme euro fx futures and cme japanese yen futures options on our cme emini russell 2000 futures and futures on three of the largest and most actively traded exchange funds in the united states we also added electronic versions of yen and dollardenominated nikkei products 

provide processing services and other business services to third parties we intend to leverage our existing capacity scalable technology and business processes to provide a broad range of services to other exchanges clearing organizations and otc markets we intend to offer services including clearing and settlement processing and risk management market structuring product structuring and trade execution platforms we believe we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering some or all of these services on a costeffective basis in combination with the potential to access our broad distribution customer base and experienced liquidity providers users of our clearing services also have the potential to gain substantial capital and collateral efficiencies for their clearing firms in january 2004 we fully implemented our agreement with the cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts the arrangement provides clearing firms and customers with the potential to gain operational performance bond and capital efficiencies as well as a combined risk capital pool and other expected cost savings as a result of our agreement with the cbot our clearing house is the largest derivatives clearing operation for futures and options on futures in the world and we now clear approximately 90 of all futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded in the united states in 2005 we cleared 675 million contracts for the cbot open interest for cbot contracts was 103 million contracts as of december 31 2005 

pursue select alliances and acquisitions we plan to supplement our internal growth through the formation of joint ventures or alliances and select acquisitions of businesses or technologies we will seek alliances and acquisitions that help us to enter new markets provide services that we currently do not offer open access to our markets or advance our technology for example in 2005 we partnered with goldman sachs to launch cme economic derivatives cme economic derivatives are options and forwards geared to seven key us and european economic indicators that allow market participants to either hedge or take market risk directly associated with the release of economic indicators including us initial jobless claims these products currently trade in cme auction markets we plan to make them available on our cme globex platform in 2006 

products 

our broad range of products includes futures contracts and options on futures contracts based on interest rates equities foreign exchange commodities and alternative investments our products are traded through our open outcry auction markets through the cme globex electronic trading platform or in privately negotiated transactions that we clear for the year ended december 31 2005 we derived 6962 million or 76 of our net revenues from fees associated with trading and clearing our products these fees include per contract charges for trade execution clearing and cme globex fees fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded the method of trade and the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade generally members are charged lower fees than nonmembers certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to encourage increased liquidity in our markets our markets also generate valuable data and information regarding pricing and trading activity in our products we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

  

the following table shows the average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product lines for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

 interest rate products cme interest rate products enable banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks and in turn help to reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing our interest rate products include our global benchmark cme eurodollar futures contract eurodollars are us dollar bank deposits outside the united states eurodollar futures contracts are shortterm interest rate products and constitute one of the most successful products in our industry and one of the most actively traded interest rate futures contracts in the world open interest in cme eurodollar futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded on our exchange was 25 million contracts as of december 31 2005 representing a notional value of 25 trillion we also trade contracts based on other shortterm interest rates such as onemonth libor which stands for the london interbank offered rate and euroyen interest rate products represented 57 of our trading volume during 2005 an average of 24 million contracts per day 

the growth of our cme eurodollar futures market has been driven by the general acceptance of the us dollar as the principal reserve currency for financial institutions throughout the world as a result eurodollar deposits have significance in the international capital markets participants in the eurodollar futures market are generally major domestic and international banks and other financial institutions that face interest rate risks from their lending and borrowing activities their activities as dealers in otc interest rate swaps and structured derivatives products and their proprietary trading activities many of these participants use cme eurodollar and other interest rate contracts to hedge or arbitrage their money market swaps or convert their interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a floating rate or a floating rate to a fixed rate asset managers also use our interest rate products to lengthen the effective maturity of shortterm investment assets by buying futures contracts or shorten the effective maturity by selling futures cme contracts are an attractive alternative when physical restructuring of a portfolio is not possible or when futures transaction costs are lower than the cash market transaction costs 

we continue to develop and implement new electronic functionality to accommodate trading strategies required for electronic trading of eurodollar contracts in 2005 we integrated our enhanced options system for trading cme eurodollar options into our cme globex electronic trading platform this enhanced functionality is designed to facilitate trading of complex combination and spread trades typically used with shortterm interest rate options on futures within a fully transparent and competitive execution environment in 2005 average daily volume of cme eurodollars traded electronically increased to 13 million contracts from 593000 in 2004 on september 22 2005 we had record electronic trading in cme eurodollar options with over 148000 contracts trading on cme globex we intend to continue to introduce functionality that will accommodate other complex trading strategies electronically 

we intend to increase our revenues from our interest rate product line by optimizing pricing of existing products introducing new products to increase our trading volume and enhancing the functionality of our cme globex electronic platform to increase the electronic trading volume of our options on futures contracts we have been active in adopting new policies and practices that are closely aligned with customer demand and designed to promote enhanced market penetration 

equity products our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure for hedging or speculative purposes to a change in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities by allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks cme equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets we offer trading in futures contracts based upon the sp 500 index nasdaq100 index certain russell indexes and other small medium and largecapitalization domestic indexes and indexes on foreign equity markets based on currently available data from the futures industry association our market share in all us listed equity futures was approximately 92 based on the number of contracts traded our total trading volume for equity products rose 19 in 2005 to 351 million contracts from 294 million contracts in 2004 trading in these products represented 34 of our total trading volume during 2005 an average of nearly 14 million contracts per day 

  

we have a license agreement with standard  poor’s corporation to use certain sp stock indexes and the related intellectual property the license is exclusive through december 31 2016 and nonexclusive through december 31 2017 with some exceptions we also have a license agreement with the nasdaq stock market inc or nasdaq that allows us to offer futures and options on futures contracts based on the nasdaq100 and the nasdaq composite indexes exclusively until october 2012 and based on the nasdaq biotechnology index provided certain performance criteria are met for a more detailed discussion of these license agreements see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—licensing agreements” in 2005 89 of our equity products trading volume was based on the sp 500 index and the nasdaq100 index 

in addition to contracts based on the sp 500 and nasdaq100 indexes we also offer equity futures and options on futures contracts based on other equity indexes including the russell 1000 and russell 2000 we also offer eight trakrs contracts trakrs are a series of nontraditional futures contracts developed with merrill lynch  co inc and licensed exclusively to us for north america and are the first broadbased index products traded on a us futures exchange that can be sold by securities brokers trakrs are designed to enable customers to track an index of stocks bonds currencies or other financial instruments 

we believe the variety of our equity futures products appeals to a broad group of equity investors these investors include public and private pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets 

we also offer emini contracts which trade exclusively on our electronic cme globex platform and are onefifth the size of their standard counterparts these products are designed to address the growing demand for equity derivatives and electronically traded products from individual traders and small institutions trading volumes in these products have grown rapidly achieving new volume and open interest records during 2005 and 2004 this growth is attributable to the benefits of equity futures and electronic market access in 2005 we offered eight emini futures and options on futures contracts including our most active emini sp 500 and emini nasdaq100 futures contracts in 2006 we launched our emini sp asia 50 futures contract and plan to launch emini msci eafe futures contracts in the first quarter of 2006 

we believe our leading market position in equity index products is a result of the liquidity of our markets the status of the sp 500 and the nasdaq100 indexes as two of the principal us financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns and the appeal to investors and traders of our emini products and our cme globex platform we believe future growth in our equity products will come from the introduction of electronically traded options on our existing equity index products including our eminis expanding customer access to our electronic markets enhancing the functionality of our cme globex electronic platform to increase the electronic trading volume of our options on futures contracts as well as further educating the marketplace on the benefits of these products 

foreign exchange products we became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in 1972 providing large and small companies with a tool to hedge foreign currency risk helps facilitate crossborder trade and commerce and reduces risk to profitability institutions such as banks hedge funds commodity trading advisors corporations and individuals use these products to manage their risks associated with or speculate on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our foreign exchange products include futures based on the euro japanese yen british pound swiss franc canadian dollar mexican peso australian dollar brazilian real new zealand dollar and south african rand and represented nearly 8 of our trading volume in 2005 an average of 334000 contracts per day 

our total foreign exchange trading volume increased 65 during 2005 from 2004 we have increased the volume of this product line by expanding the distribution of our foreign exchange products matched through the cme globex platform and by establishing incentive programs to increase volume and liquidity in 2005 electronically traded foreign exchange futures volume increased 100 over 2004 from 340 million contracts to 681 million contracts open outcry trading decreased 20 from 99 million contracts in 2004 to 79 million contracts in 2005 

we expect the growth in our foreign exchange product line to continue to come from increased electronic trading on our cme globex platform which provides a transparent central limit order book speed anonymity and central party clearing benefits we also expect increased trading from customers outside of the united states including increased trading through our telecommunications hubs 

  

commodity products cme commodity products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management for the agricultural community these products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities including agricultural producers of commodities and food processors commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business we have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products including futures contracts based on cattle hogs pork bellies lumber and dairy products commodity products accounted for 1 of our trading volume during 2005 an average of more than 49600 contracts per day and an increase of 23 from 2004 on january 11 2006 we had our highest volume day ever with 140000 contracts traded our commodity products are traded through our open outcry and electronic trading execution facilities and through privately negotiated transactions 

we continue to execute our strategy of growing our customer base and providing sidebyside access to our commodity markets we believe the changing perception of commodities as an asset class provides an opportunity for growth in our markets 

market data and information products our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products the market data we supply is central to trading activity in our products and to trading activity in related cash and derivatives markets we sell our market data which includes information about bids offers trades and trade size to banks brokerdealers pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions we distribute our market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets through our electronic facilities we also distribute market data via dedicated networks to approximately 262 worldwide quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges other third party data providers and news services and then resell their consolidated data as of december 31 2005 we displayed our data on approximately 179000 devices revenues from market data products totaled 717 million or 8 of our net revenues in 2005 

we continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by packaging the basic data we have traditionally offered with advanced analytical data and information we have created marketing programs to increase the use of our market data 

execution 

our trade execution facilities consist of our open outcry trading floors and the cme globex electronic trading platform both of these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency and are stateoftheart trading environments supported by substantial infrastructure and technology for order routing trade reporting market data dissemination and market surveillance and regulation in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house the following chart shows the range of trade execution choices we provide our customers in some of our key products 

 

 open outcry trading open outcry trading represented 29 of our total trading volume in 2005 the trading floors are the centralized meeting place for floor traders and floor brokers representing customer orders to trade contracts the trading floors covering approximately 70000 square feet have tiered booths surrounding the pits from which clearing firm personnel can communicate with customers regarding current market activity and prices and receive orders either electronically or by telephone in addition our trading floors display current market information and news on electronic wallboards hung above the pits during 2005 approximately 21 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from open outcry trading 

  

cme globex electronic trading platform the cme globex electronic trading platform maintains an electronic centralized order book and trade execution algorithm for futures contracts and options on futures contracts and allows users to enter orders directly into the order book initially our electronic trading platform was used to offer our products to customers after the close of our regular daytime trading sessions today however we trade some of our most successful products on the cme globex platform nearly 24 hours a day five days a week in 2005 70 of our trading volume was executed using cme globex compared with 57 in 2004 electronic trading volume has increased from 35 million contracts in 2000 to 730 million contracts in 2005 during 2005 approximately 73 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from electronic trading on september 1 2005 cme globex volume set a new singleday record of 69 million contracts traded 

privately negotiated transactions in addition to offering traditional open outcry and electronic trading through the cme globex platform we permit qualified customers to trade our products by entering into privately negotiated transactions which are reported and included in the market data we distribute we also clear settle and guarantee these transactions through our clearing house some market participants value privately negotiated transactions as a way to ensure that large transactions can be completed at a single price or in a single transaction while preserving their ability to effectively complete a hedging risk management or other trading strategy during 2005 approximately 6 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from this type of trading 

clearing 

we operate our own clearing house that clears settles and guarantees the performance of all transactions matched through our execution facilities and futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded through the cbot in 2005 our clearing house cleared an average of 70 million contracts daily and 18 billion contracts overall many derivatives exchanges do not provide clearing services for trades matched through their execution facilities relying instead on outside clearing houses to provide these services ownership and control of our own clearing house enables us to capture the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products this is particularly important for trade execution alternatives such as privately negotiated block trades where we can derive a higher clearing fee for each contract traded compared to other trades by owning our clearing house we also control the cost structure and the technology development cycle for our clearing services it also helps us manage our new product initiatives without being dependent on an outside entity we believe having an integrated clearing function provides significant competitive advantages additionally owning our own clearing house allows us to generate additional revenue by providing clearing services to other exchanges such as the cbot 

on august 31 2005 we processed a record of approximately 24 million transactions we maintain the largest futures and options on futures open interest of any exchange in the world as of december 31 2005 our open interest stood at 301 million contracts and our open interest record was 393 million contracts set on december 15 2005 as of december 31 2005 we acted as custodian for approximately 458 billion in performance bond collateral deposited by our clearing firms and during 2005 we moved an average of approximately 17 billion a day in settlement funds through our clearing system in addition our clearing house guarantees the performance of our contracts with a financial safeguards package of approximately 41 billion 

in january 2004 we fully implemented our arrangement with the cbot for us to provide clearing and transaction processing services in providing these services to the cbot our clearing house clears settles and guarantees all cbot transactions using the full resources of our clearing processes and financial safeguards package open interest in cbot products cleared by our clearing house on december 31 2005 was 103 million contracts 

the clearing function provides three primary benefits to our markets efficient highvolume transaction processing cost and capital efficiencies and a reliable credit guarantee the services we provide can be broadly categorized as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

   

transaction processing and position management we developed a stateoftheart clearing system clearing 21 in conjunction with nymex to provide high quality clearing services this system processes reported trades and positions on a realtime basis providing users with instantaneous information on trades positions and risk exposure clearing 21 is able to process trades in futures and options products securities and cash instruments clearing 21 can also support complex new product types including combinations options on combinations options on options swaps repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other instruments through clearing 21 user interfaces our clearing firms can electronically manage their positions exercise options enter transactions related to foreign exchange deliveries manage collateral posted to meet performance bond requirements and access all of our other online applications together with our order routing and trade matching services we offer straightthrough electronic processing of transactions in which an order is electronically routed matched cleared and made available to the clearing firm’s backoffice systems for further processing 

crossmargining and mutual offset services we have led the derivatives industry in establishing crossmargining agreements with other leading clearing houses crossmargining arrangements reduce capital costs for clearing firms and customers these agreements permit an individual clearing house to recognize a clearing firm’s open positions at other participating clearing houses and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at other participating clearing houses this arrangement reduces the need for collateral deposits by the clearing firm for example our crossmargining program with the options clearing corporation reduced performance bond requirements for our members by approximately 13 billion a day in the fourth quarter of 2005 we have implemented crossmargining arrangements with nymex the fixed income clearing corporation and lchclearnet group for positions at the london international financial futures and options exchange in addition our mutual offset agreement with the singapore derivatives exchange which has been in place since 1984 allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products and then transfer them back to the originating exchange this mutual offset arrangement enables firms to seamlessly execute trades at either exchange virtually 24 hours per day 

market protection and risk management our clearing house guarantee of performance is a significant attraction and an important part of the functioning of our exchange because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies 

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products our clearing house uses our proprietary cme span software which determines the appropriate performance bond requirements by simulating the gains and losses of complex portfolios we typically hold performance bond collateral to cover at least 95 of price changes for a given product within a given historical period performance bond requirements for a clearing firm’s or customer’s overall portfolio are calculated using cme span 

at each settlement cycle our clearing house values at the market price prevailing at that time or markstomarket all open positions and requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value our clearing house markstomarket all open positions at least twice a day and more often if market volatility warrants markingtomarket provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract 

having a marktomarket cycle of a minimum of two times a day helps protect the financial integrity of our clearing house our clearing firms and market participants this allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions 

in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the clearing firm to cover its payment obligation these assets include security deposits performance bonds and any other available assets such as the proceeds from the sale of class a and class b common stock and trading rights of the clearing firm at our exchange owned by or assigned to the clearing firm in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent of a clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our surplus funds security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit we maintain a committed 750 million 364day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks we have the option to increase the facility from 750 million to 1 billion however the banks do not 

  

have to comply with our request this line of credit may also be utilized if there is a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay settlement payments between our clearing house and clearing firms the credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as security deposit funds in our second interest earning facility program called ief2 to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line 

the following shows the available assets of our clearing house at december 31 2005 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm 

cme clearing house available assets 

in millions 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 settlement collateral and delivery services we manage final settlement in all of our contracts including cash settlement physical delivery of selected commodities and option exercises and assignments because some initial and maintenance performance bonds from clearing firms as well as marktomarket obligations on some of our contracts are denominated in various foreign currencies we offer multicurrency performance bond and settlement services we also offer the moneychanger function to our clearing firms this service provides members with access to overnight funds in various foreign currencies at competitive bidask spreads free of charge to satisfy the terms of a foreign currency denominated futures contract 

  

although more than 95 of all futures contracts are liquidated before the expiration of the contract the underlying financial instruments or commodities for the remainder of the contracts must be delivered we act as the delivery agent for all such contracts ensuring timely delivery by the seller of the exact quality and quantity specified in a contract and full and timely payment by the buyer 

in order to administer its system of financial safeguards efficiently our clearing house has developed banking relationships with a network of major us banks and banking industry infrastructure providers such as the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications among the key services provided to our clearing house by these banks and service providers are a variety of custody credit and payment services that support the substantial financial commitments and processes backing the guarantee of our clearing house to market participants 

investment services in order to achieve collateral efficiencies for our clearing firms we have established a number of collateral programs under the designation interest earning facility or ief under this program our clearing firms may select from four different ief programs to meet their individual needs the programs are designed to enable our clearing firms to make optimal use of the demand deposit cash accounts and security accounts they have established to satisfy our performance bond requirements as of december 31 2005 there was more than 196 billion in balances in these programs compared with 191 billion at december 31 2004 we earn fee income in return for providing these valueadded services to our clearing firms in december 2005 we discontinued our ief1 program which was the only ief program with a guaranteed investment principal and accrued interest 

our clearing house launched a securities lending program in 2001 using a portion of certain securities deposited to meet the proprietary performance bond requirements of our clearing firms under this securities lending program we lend a security to a third party and receive collateral in the form of cash the majority of the cash is then invested on an overnight basis to generate interest income the related interest expense represents payment to the borrower of the security for the cash collateral retained during the duration of the lending transaction securities on loan are markedtomarket daily and compared to collateral received 

technology 

our operation of both open outcry and electronic trading facilities and a clearing house has influenced the design and implementation of the technologies that support our operations 

trading technology we have a proven track record of operating successful open outcry and electronic markets by developing and integrating multiple evolving technologies that support a growing and substantial trading volume the integrated suite of technologies we employ to accomplish this has been designed to support a significant expansion of our current business and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our technology base into new markets products and services 

as electronic trading activity expands we continue to provide greater match engine functionality unique to various markets market models and product types we have adopted a modular approach to technology development and engineered an integrated set of solutions that support multiple specialized markets we continually monitor and upgrade our capacity requirements our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our historical peak transactions in our highest volume products significant investments in production planning quality assurance and certification processes have enhanced our ability to expedite the delivery of the system enhancements that we develop for our customers 

speed reliability scalability capacity and functionality are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms a substantial portion of our operating budget is dedicated to system design development and operations in order to achieve high levels of overall system performance for example we plan to implement additional functionality for our cme eurodollar and foreign exchange options for user defined spreads and the facilitation of covered options and futures trading we also have two remote data facilities to provide additional system capacity and redundancy for our trading and clearing technology our data centers support our customer interfaces trading and execution systems as well as clearing and settlement operations 

  

the technology systems supporting our trading operations can be divided into five major categories 

 

 the cme globex electronic trading platform includes the distribution order routing order management trade matching and market data technology the modularity and functionality of cme globex enable us to selectively add products with unique trading characteristics onto the trading platform with minimal additional investment 

the distribution technologies we offer differentiate our platform and bring liquidity and trading volume to our execution facilities as of december 31 2005 nearly 2500 customers connected directly with us and thousands more connected with us through 30 independent software vendors and data centers as well as all clearing firms that have interfaces with our systems many of these customers connect through a dedicated private network that is readily available has wide distribution and provides fast connections in the americas europe and asia in 2005 we partnered with mci att and yipes enterprise services inc to implement our next generation network providing direct ethernet connectivity reducing latency and increasing bandwidth we have also established telecommunications hubs in amsterdam dublin frankfurt gibraltar london milan paris and singapore to respond to customer requests and reduce the cost of trading for our foreign customers we now have direct customer access to our exchange in over 70 countries 

in order routing and management we offer a range of mechanisms and were among the first us derivatives exchanges to fully implement the fix 42 protocol—the standard order routing protocol used within the securities industry in addition our order routing and order management systems are capable of supporting multiple electronic trading match engines this functionality gives us great latitude in the types of markets that we choose to serve 

several key technology platforms and standards are used to support these activities including faulttolerant nonstop tandem systems ibm mainframes sun microsystems and hp servers hp and dell pcs oracle and db2 databases linux unix novell tibco middleware and multivendor network solutions 

our match engine is based upon the computerized trading and match software known as the nsc system we have a longterm license from euronextparis under which we have the ability to modify and upgrade the performance of the basic nsc system to optimize its performance to suit our needs we have a fully trained development team that maintains upgrades and customizes our version of the nsc system for example despite a large increase in transaction volume we reduced our average matching engine response time from approximately 011 seconds at the beginning of 2005 to approximately 005 seconds at yearend allowing trades to be executed more quickly the customized enhancements that we have developed address the unique trading demands of each marketplace that we serve we continue to focus on performance features of the match engine and presently have multiple enhancements under development 

clearing technology clearing 21 our clearing and settlement software and cme span our margining and risk management software form the core of our clearing technology 

clearing 21 is a system for highvolume highcapacity clearing and settlement of exchangebased transactions that we developed jointly with nymex the system offers clearing firms improved efficiency and reduced costs clearing 21’s modular design gives us the ability to rapidly introduce new products the software can be customized to meet the unique needs of specialized markets 

cme span is our sophisticated margining and risk management software cme span has now been adopted by 52 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide this software simulates the effects of changing market conditions on a complex portfolio and uses standard options pricing models to determine a portfolio’s overall risk cme span then generates a performance bond requirement that typically covers 95 of price changes within a given historical period 

  

strategic relationships 

chicago board of trade in april 2003 we entered into an agreement with the cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts we began providing clearing services for cbot’s commodity equity index and a subset of cbot’s interest rate products on november 24 2003 and as of january 2 2004 we began clearing all of cbot’s remaining products in providing services to the cbot our clearing house clears settles and guarantees all cbot transactions using the full resources of our clearing processes and financial safeguards package we cleared 675 million contracts for the cbot in 2005 open interest for cbot contracts was 103 million contracts at december 31 2005 the initial term of the agreement is until january 2009 with subsequent three year renewals upon the mutual consent of the parties 

goldman sachs in 2005 we partnered with goldman sachs to provide a clearing solution for its auction markets through the launch of cme economic derivatives cme economic derivatives provide a way of hedging and initiating portfolio risk on macroeconomic events and are based on seven key us and european economic indicators including the us initial jobless claims these products are traded in cme auction markets in 2006 we plan to make these products available on our cme globex platform 

new york mercantile exchange from 2002 through november 2005 we jointly operated a cooperative arrangement with nymex to introduce smallsized versions of key nymex energy futures contracts called eminy energy futures for trading on our cme globex electronic trading platform and clearing at the nymex clearing house as a result of this arrangement we are generally prohibited until june 2006 other than in cooperation with nymex from providing for or facilitating electronic trading in futures or options on futures contracts on any underlying commodity or index of such commodities that was also the underlying commodity for a product listed for trading as of june 2002 by nymex 

onechicago onechicago is our joint venture with the chicago board options exchange or cboe and the cbot for the trading of single stock futures and futures based on narrowbased stock indexes we currently own approximately a 40 interest in the joint venture in 2005 we began a process to identify a possible strategic investor or investors to secure additional capital for onechicago and increase the joint venture’s chance of success 

reuters in the first quarter of 2005 we launched our initiative with reuters to offer access to our electronic foreign exchange markets to reuters’ global customer base over the reuters dealing 3000 trading system this arrangement gives dealers in the interbank market direct access to our foreign exchange products in cash equivalent format and enhances their ability to seamlessly trade foreign exchange spot forwards and futures 

singapore derivatives exchange ltd in 1984 we entered into a mutual offset agreement with the singapore derivatives exchange and in november 2003 we entered into an extension of the agreement which expires in february 2007 this relationship allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products then transfer them back to the originating exchange in connection with this agreement we are generally prohibited from listing euroyen electronically as well as outside of our regular trading hours 

marketing programs and advertising 

our marketing programs primarily target institutional customers and to a lesser extent individual traders our marketing programs for institutional customers aim to inform traders portfolio managers corporate treasurers and other market professionals about novel uses of our products such as new hedging and risk management strategies we also strive to educate these users about changes in product design performance bond requirements and new clearing services we participate in major domestic and international trade shows and seminars regarding futures contracts and options on futures contracts and other derivatives products in addition we sponsor educational workshops and marketing events designed to educate market users about our products through these relationships and programs we attempt to understand the needs of our customer base and use information provided by them to drive our product development efforts 

our advertising strategies seek to increase awareness and strengthen perceptions of us among our institutional and retail customers as well as support an increase in our trading volume our primary method of advertising has been through print media utilizing trade magazines and newsletters as well as daily business publications however we also use online television sponsorship and other targeted advertisements to reach our target audiences 

  

competition 

prior to the passage of the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 or the cfma futures trading was generally required to take place on or subject to the rules of a federally designated contract market the costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation complying with applicable regulatory requirements establishing efficient execution facilities and liquidity pools and attracting customers created significant barriers to entry for competing exchanges the cfma eroded the historical dominance by the exchanges of futures trading in the united states by among other things eliminating uncertainty with respect to the enforceability of private transactions in most futures contracts and similar products authorizing the use of electronic trading systems to conduct both private and public futures transactions and lowering or eliminating entry barriers for new exchanges for a more detailed description of the regulation of our industry and the regulatory changes brought on by the cfma see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

the cfma and other changing market dynamics have led to increasing competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different domestic and international sources of varied size business objectives and resources we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges otc markets and clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and other competitors 

at yearend 2005 there were 57 futures exchanges located in 30 countries including nine futures exchanges in the united states in february 2004 eurex commenced operation of its us derivatives exchange us futures exchange llc or eurex us eurex us’s initial competitive efforts were directed at the cbot however eurex us has expanded its product offerings in direct competition with us to include futures based on the russell 1000 and russell 2000 indexes and foreign exchange rates in addition in march 2004 euronextliffe began listing and trading eurodollar futures contracts because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets we also compete with securities and options exchanges including the new york stock exchange and the cboe dealer markets such as nasdaq and alternative trading systems 

otc markets for foreign exchange and fixedincome derivatives products also compete with us the largest foreign exchange markets are operated primarily as electronic trading systems two of the largest of these operated by electronic brokering services and reuters serve primarily professional foreign exchange trading firms additional electronic platforms designed to serve corporate foreign exchange users are beginning to emerge two of these are operated by consortia of interdealer and interbank market participants a third is a proprietary trading system in addition certain provisions of the cfma have led to an increase in unregulated electronic and brokerage trading systems in the foreign exchange market 

the otc fixedincome derivatives market is by far the largest fixedincome derivatives marketplace the otc market consists primarily of interbank and interdealer market participants there is currently no single liquidity pool in the otc fixedincome derivatives market that is comparable to our eurodollar market the otc market for fixedincome derivatives products has traditionally been limited to more customized products and the large credit exposures created in this market and the absence of clearing facilities have limited participation to the most creditworthy institutional participants however the size of this market and technologydriven developments in electronic trading and clearing facilities as well as regulatory changes implemented by the cfma increase the likelihood that one or more substantial liquidity pools will emerge in the future in the otc fixedincome derivatives market 

alternative trade execution facilities that currently specialize in the trading of equity securities have electronic trade execution and routing systems that also can be used to trade products that compete with our products 

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent potential competitors because as purveyors of market data these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities as technology firms they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks additionally technology and software firms that develop trading systems hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets 

we also face a threat of trading volume loss if a significant number of our traditional participants decide to trade futures or similar products among themselves without using any exchange or specific trading system the cfma allows nearly all of our largest customers to transact futures or similar products directly with each other while those transactions raise liquidity and credit concerns they may be attractive based on execution costs flexibility of terms negotiability of margin or collateral deposits or other considerations additionally changes under the cfma permitting the establishment of 

  

standalone clearing facilities for futures and otc derivatives transactions will facilitate the mitigation of creditrisk concentrations arising from such transactions 

we believe competition among exchanges in the derivatives and securities businesses is based on a number of factors including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets breadth of product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs 

our business is highly competitive we expect competition to continue to intensify particularly as a result of technological advances and the cfma and other changes introduced by the commodity futures trading commission or cftc that have reduced the regulatory requirements for the development and entry of products and markets that are competitive with our own additional factors that may intensify competition in the future include an increase in the number of forprofit exchanges the consolidation of our customer base or intermediary base an increased acceptance of electronic trading and electronic order routing by our customer base and the ability of other exchanges leveraging their technology investment and electronic distribution to enter new markets and list the products of other exchanges 

in addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services including 

 

  

 we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the cost of the services provided quality and reliability of the services timely delivery of the services reputation and value of linking with existing products markets and distribution 

regulatory matters 

the commodity exchange act the scope of which was significantly expanded in 1974 subjected us to comprehensive regulation by the cftc under the 1974 amendments the cftc was granted exclusive jurisdiction over futures contracts and options on such contracts and on commodities such contracts were generally required to be traded on regulated exchanges known as contract markets the commodity exchange act placed our business in a heavily regulated environment but imposed significant barriers to unregulated competition 

between 1974 and december 2000 the barriers against unregulated competitors were eroded the commodity exchange act’s exchange trading requirement was modified by cftc regulations and interpretations to permit privately negotiated swap contracts meeting specified requirements to be transacted in the otc market as of june 2005 according to data from the bank for international settlements the total estimated notional amount of outstanding otc derivatives contracts was approximately 270 trillion compared to approximately 59 trillion for exchangetraded futures and options on futures contracts the cftc exemption and interpretations under which the otc derivatives market operated precluded the otc market from using exchangelike electronic transaction systems and clearing facilities 

  

the cfma significantly altered the regulatory landscape and may have important competitive consequences this legislation greatly expanded the freedom of regulated markets like ours to innovate and respond to competition it also permits us to offer a previously prohibited set of products—single stock futures and futures on narrowbased indexes of securities the provisions that permit us to trade these security futures products require a novel sharing of jurisdiction between the cftc and the securities and exchange commission or sec exchange trading of these security futures products is subject to more burdensome regulation than our other futures products for example in order to trade these products we are required to “notice register” with the sec as a special purpose national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading security futures products and the sec is authorized to review some of our rules relating to these security futures products our members trading those products are subject to registration requirements and duties and obligations to customers under the securities laws that do not pertain to their other futures business 

the cfma excluded or exempted many of the activities of our nonexchange competitors from regulation under the commodity exchange act the cfma created broad exclusions and exemptions from the commodity exchange act that permit derivatives contracts which may serve the same or similar functions as the contracts we offer to be sold in the largely unregulated otc market including through electronic trading facilities 

additionally the cfma permits secregulated and bank clearing organizations to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that such clearing organizations have traditionally cleared the cfma also permits banks and brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to offer and sell foreign exchange futures to retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act 

the cfma created a flexible regulatory framework for us in our capacity as a cftc registrant and eliminated many prescriptive requirements of the commodity exchange act and cftc in favor of more broad and flexible core principles for instance cftcregulated exchanges may now list new contracts and adopt new rules without prior cftc approval under selfcertification procedures permitting timelier product launch and modification 

for regulated markets the cfma created a threetiered regulatory structure the degree of regulation is related to the characteristics of the product and the type of customer that has direct or indirect access to the market with retail customer markets being subject to greater regulation the threetiered regulatory structure is as follows 

 

  

  

 our existing market which trades a broad range of products and permits intermediaries to represent unsophisticated customers is subject to the most thorough oversight as a designated contract market the cfma permits us to organize markets that are subject to lesser regulation depending on the types of products traded and the types of traders markets can be organized that trade only products that are unlikely to be susceptible to manipulation and permit direct trading only among institutional participants in order to achieve a less intrusive degree of oversight for example in september 2005 we created cme alternative marketplace inc a wholly owned subsidiary of cme and an exempt board of trade registered with the cftc for the trading of cme economic derivatives 

the cfma also provides for regulation of derivatives clearing organizations or dcos like our clearing house separately from the exchanges for which they clear contracts and permits dcos to clear a range of otctraded products in addition to products traded on an exchange the cfma requires a dco that clears for a registered futures exchange to register with the cftc however our clearing house was deemed to be registered by reason of its activities prior to enactment of the cfma our clearing house is required to comply with a separate set of flexible core principles that specifically apply to clearing houses a dco may accept for clearing any new contract or may adopt any new rule or rule amendment by providing to the cftc a written certification that the new contract rule or rule amendment complies with the commodity exchange act alternatively the dco may request that the cftc grant prior approval to any contract rule or rule amendment and the cftc must grant approval within 75 days unless the cftc finds that the proposed contract rule or rule amendment would violate the commodity exchange act 

  

demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “selfregulation” that has been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program the cftc is conducting an ongoing review of selfregulatory organizations and the appropriate role if any of self regulation in the futures markets 

from time to time it is proposed in congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated including a possible merger between the cftc and the sec while those proposals have not been adopted to date the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely to the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years which was scheduled to be completed in 2005 this process is still ongoing and could result in legislation that may have a negative impact on the way we operate our exchange including our ability to operate our selfregulatory functions or effectively compete with new entrants into our market place 

from time to time it is proposed in the president’s budget including the 2007 proposed budget that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions while those proposals have not been adopted to date except for a percontract fee on single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the imposition of any such tax could increase the cost of using our products and consequently our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

our members 

cme members can execute trades for their own accounts for clearing firm accounts for the accounts of other members or for the accounts of customers of clearing firms members who trade for their own account including those who lease trading rights qualify for lower transaction fees in recognition of the market liquidity that their trading activity provides these members also benefit from market information advantages that may accrue from their proximity to activity on the trading floors generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers in 2005 our members were responsible for nearly 79 of our total trading volume there are four divisions of membership at our exchange the chicago mercantile exchange or cme division the international monetary market or imm division the index and option market or iom division and the growth and emerging markets or gem division each membership division has different trading rights membership applicants planning to access the trading floor are subject to a review and approval process prior to becoming members and obtaining trading rights we have individual trading members and clearing firms as of december 31 2005 there were approximately 80 clearing firms

 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 

shareholders who own trading rights or are officers or directors of others who own trading rights on our exchange account for 12 of the 20 directors on our board these shareholders may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their rights to elect directors may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

as of april 27 2005 the date of our most recent annual meeting of shareholders 12 of the 20 directors on our board owned or were officers or directors of others who owned trading rights on our exchange we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members this dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchange in addition trading rights on our exchange have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets our trading members many of whom act as floor brokers and floor traders benefit from trading rules membership privileges and fee discounts that enhance their open outcry trading opportunities and profits our predominantly electronic trading members benefit from fee discounts and transaction fee caps that enhance their electronic trading opportunities and profits our clearing firms benefit from all of the foregoing as well as decisions that increase electronic trading which over time will reduce their costs of doing business on our exchange as a result holders of our class a common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the role they serve in our markets their method of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us 

the board representation rights of our members in combination with the charter provision protections described in the immediately following risk factor could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value 

our certificate of incorporation grants special rights to holders of class b common stock which protect their trading rights and give them special board representation and require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant 

under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our class b shareholders have the ability to protect their rights to trade on our exchange by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of our trading floor in particular these provisions include a grant to the holders of our class b common stock of the right to approve any changes to 

 

  

  

  

 our class b shareholders are also entitled to elect six of the 20 directors on our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent 

our certificate of incorporation also includes a provision requiring us to maintain open outcry floor trading on our exchange for a particular traded product as long as the open outcry market is “liquid” our certificate of incorporation requires us to maintain a facility for conducting business disseminating price information clearing and delivery and to provide reasonable financial support for technology marketing and research for open outcry markets our certificate of incorporation provides specific tests as to whether an open outcry market will be deemed liquid as measured on a quarterly basis if a market is deemed illiquid as a result of a failure to meet any of these tests our board may determine whether such market should be closed 

  

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

we generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees and our processing services provided to third parties we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future each of these revenue sources is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets and in the markets we provide processing services our trading volume is directly affected by us domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets our operating results and trading volume tend to increase during periods of global and domestic economic and geopolitical uncertainty this is because our customers seek to hedge or manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange and commodity markets the future economic environment will be subject to periodic downturns including possible recession and lower volatility in financial markets and may not be as favorable as it has been in recent years as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful trends less favorable than those of recent periods could result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our cost structure is largely fixed if our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs our profitability will be adversely affected 

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability will be adversely affected 

the success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic trading systems that have the functionality performance reliability speed and liquidity required by our customers 

the future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance reliability speed and liquidity to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our current overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our cme globex electronic platform however during 2005 29 of our volume and approximately 21 of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was generated through our open outcry trading facilities most of our open outcry volume is related to trading in options on our futures contracts our electronic functionality may not be capable of accommodating all of the complex trading strategies typically used for trading options on futures contracts in august 2005 we integrated our enhanced options system for trading cme eurodollar options into our cme globex electronic trading platform this enhanced functionality is designed to facilitate trading of complex combination and spread trades typically used with shortterm interest rate options on futures within a fully transparent and competitive environment we also plan to increase its functionality to include trading of other option contracts however we may not complete the development of or successfully implement the required electronic functionality for cme’s options on futures contracts moreover our customers who trade options may not accept our electronic trading systems in either event our ability to increase trading volume of options on futures contracts on the cme globex platform would be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality performance 

  

reliability speed and liquidity we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading 

the enhancement of our electronic trading platform exposes us to risks inherent in operating in the evolving market for electronic transaction services if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or if our customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

we must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or our current or potential customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

if we are not able to keep up with rapid technological changes our business will be materially harmed 

to remain competitive we must continue to improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and other features of our software network distribution systems and technologies the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology changes in customer demand and uses of products and services frequent product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing technology and systems obsolete our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological advancements and changing standards in a timely costefficient and competitive manner we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our technology to customer and competitive requirements or emerging industry standards 

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business will not survive 

the derivatives securities and financial services industries are highly competitive we expect that competition will continue to intensify in the future our current and prospective competitors both domestically and around the world are numerous they include securities and securities option exchanges futures exchanges otc markets clearing organizations market data and information vendors electronic communications networks crossing systems and similar entities consortia of large customers consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities at december 31 2005 there were 57 futures exchanges located in 30 countries including nine futures exchanges in the united states in february 2004 eurex commenced operation of its us derivatives exchange eurex us eurex us’s initial competitive efforts were directed at the cbot however eurex us has expanded its product offerings in direct competition with us to include futures based on the russell 1000 and russell 2000 indexes and foreign exchange rates additionally in march 2004 euronextliffe began listing and trading eurodollar futures contracts 

we believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies the number of businesses providing internetrelated financial services is rapidly growing other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may become competitive with us through acquisitions changes in federal law allow institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar products to provide lower transaction costs and better 

  

execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can in addition our competitors may 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed in addition even if new entrants do not significantly erode our market share we may be required to reduce our fees significantly to remain competitive which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract 

our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded the trading venue and the mix of customers whether the customer receives member or nonmember fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs and the impact of our tiered pricing structure for example we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed on the cme globex electronic trading platform in addition our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period for example our average rate per contract decreased to 0664 for the year ended december 31 2005 from 0702 for the same period in 2004 because of this fluctuation you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance 

generally we have experienced relatively higher volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

the cfma has reduced the barriers of entry into our markets which has led to increased competition and enabled many of our customers to trade futures contracts other than on exchanges these changes may adversely affect our trading volume revenue and profits 

our industry has been subject to several fundamental regulatory changes including changes in the statute under which we have operated since 1974 the commodity exchange act generally required all futures contracts to be executed on an exchange that had been approved by the cftc the “exchange trading requirement” was modified by cftc regulations and interpretations to permit privately negotiated swap contracts to be transacted in the otc market the cftc exemption under which the otc derivatives market operated precluded the otc market from using exchangelike electronic transaction systems and clearing facilities these barriers to competition from the otc market were repealed by the cfma one of the 

  

chief beneficiaries of the cfma has been otc dealers and competitors that operate or intend to open electronic trading facilities or to conduct their futures business directly among themselves on a bilateral basis the customers who may access these trading facilities or engage in bilateral private transactions are the same customers who account for a substantial portion of our trading volume the cfma also permits banks brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to engage in foreign exchange futures transactions for or with retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act these customers are the same customers who might otherwise use cme foreign exchange products in the future our industry may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely impact our business including our ability to compete with enterprises which offer offexchange trading and which benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lowercost business model 

the cfma also permits bank clearing organizations and clearing organizations regulated by the sec to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that these clearing organizations have traditionally cleared this allocation of jurisdiction may be advantageous to competing clearing organizations and result in a lower volume of trading cleared through our clearing house 

our members may seek alternative trading venues and products which may negatively impact the liquidity of our markets and our trading volume 

the trading activities of our members accounted for 79 and 78 of our trading volume during 2005 and 2004 respectively subject to the oversight of our board of directors our management is charged with making decisions that are designed to enhance shareholder value which may lead to decisions or outcomes with which our members disagree these changes may make us less attractive to our members and encourage them to conduct their business at or seek membership in another exchange or to trade in equivalent products among themselves on a private bilateral basis a material decrease in member trading activity that is not offset by an increase in nonmember trading would negatively impact liquidity and trading volume in our products and reduce our revenues a loss or material reduction in the number of our clearing firms and the capital they provide to guarantee their trades and the trades of their customers would also diminish the strength and attractiveness of our clearing house and our markets 

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange 

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution alternatives our success also depends on our ability to maintain our trading volume and to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers for example the majority of the clearing and transaction fees we receive from our clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers we believe that in the event one of our clearing firms discontinues operations the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm however we cannot guarantee you that the discontinuation of any clearing firm would not result in our loss of customers which could have an adverse effect on our trading volumes or revenues we also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to lowcost competitors with comparable or superior products services or trade execution facilities if we fail to maintain our trading volume to expand our product offerings or execution facilities or we lose a substantial number of our current customers or are unable to attract new customers our business will be adversely affected 

any significant decline in the trading volume of our cme eurodollar sp 500 or nasdaq100 futures and options on futures contracts would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we are substantially dependent on trading volume from three product offerings for a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits the clearing and transaction fees revenue attributable to transactions in cme eurodollar contracts and all our contracts based on the sp 500 and nasdaq100 including cme emini products approximated 44 25 and 7 respectively of our total clearing and transaction fees revenue during the year ended december 31 2005 and 43 26 and 10 respectively during the year ended december 31 2004 any significant decline in our trading volume in any of these products would negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results 

we believe our cme eurodollar futures contract serves as a global financial benchmark but we cannot assure you that in the future other products will not become preferred alternatives to our cme eurodollar contract as a means of managing or speculating on interest rate risk we also cannot assure you that competitors will not enter the eurodollar market for example in march 2004 euronextliffe began listing and trading eurodollar futures contracts our members may 

  

also elect to trade eurodollars in privately negotiated bilateral transactions without the use of our clearing house in either of these events our trading volume revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

our rights to the standard  poor’s and nasdaq products were obtained through licensing arrangements our license agreement with standard  poor’s provides that the sp 500 index futures products will be exclusive through december 31 2008 after which we will retain our exclusive rights through december 31 2016 so long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume our license with nasdaq is exclusive with respect to futures and options on futures contracts based on the nasdaq100 index through october 9 2007 with an automatic renewal until october 9 2012 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of these licensing agreements in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use alternative instruments including securities and options based on the sp and nasdaq indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond the jurisdictional reach of us andor our licensors we also cannot assure you that nasdaq will not directly or indirectly through other exchanges offer security futures contracts that compete with our broadbased index futures contracts based upon nasdaq indexes 

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties our financial condition will be adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our exchange or on thirdparty exchanges for which we provide processing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including our clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons we cannot guarantee you that one of our clearing firms will not default on its obligations in the future a substantial part of our working capital is at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default additionally the default of any one of our clearing firms could cause our customers to lose confidence in our markets and the guarantee of our clearing house which would have an adverse affect on our business 

we may not continue to realize the benefits of our agreement to provide processing services for cbot products 

we entered into an agreement with the cbot in april 2003 which was subsequently amended in march 2004 to provide processing services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts under the terms of the agreement clearing services for commodity equities and some interest rate products began in november 2003 and for all other cbot futures and options on futures contracts on january 2 2004 in the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we cleared 675 million and 600 million contracts for the cbot respectively which generated 642 million and 551 million respectively in processing services revenue we cannot assure you that we will continue to realize the benefits received from our processing agreement our future revenues from providing these processing services will be dependent on the cbot’s ability to maintain andor expand its trading volume which is subject to a number of factors beyond its control as a futures exchange the cbot’s ability to maintain or expand its volume and operate its business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject any significant decrease in the cbot’s trading volume will result in a corresponding decrease in our realized benefits our net income from the processing services we provide to the cbot will also depend on our ability to control our costs associated with providing such services 

the initial term of the agreement is until january 2009 with subsequent three year renewals upon the mutual consent of the parties the terms of the agreement also provide that both we and the cbot may terminate the agreement in some circumstances we cannot assure you that the agreement will not be terminated prior to the end of its term or that the agreement will be renewed after its initial term or that any renewal will be on terms as favorable to us any such event could have an adverse effect on our revenues 

  

our market data fees may be reduced or eliminated by the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems if we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we will experience a reduction in revenue 

we sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data totaled 717 million representing 8 of our net revenues and 609 million or 8 of our net revenues during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate charges for supplying market data to trading terminals if we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals we will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost quote fee revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees 

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

we are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar events if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled for example in april 2005 may 2003 and september 2002 we experienced technical failures that resulted in a temporary suspension of trading on the cme globex platform the impact of these events has not been material however we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not be material 

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex trading volume may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform 

  

system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volume of transactions grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increased volume of transactions and to provide processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not–for–profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchange even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit or stop the use of our markets 

some of our largest clearing firms which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with the futures industry association have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish or seek to use alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchange even if they are not successful in their efforts the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets if any of these events occur our revenues and profits would be adversely affected 

we depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption in or the cessation of an important supply or service by any third party and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all would result in lost revenue and higher costs 

our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities we could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems 

we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities 

  

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

although the cfma significantly reduced our regulatory burdens we remain extensively regulated by the cftc our international operations may be subject to similar regulations in specific jurisdictions we are registered in a number of countries outside the united states in some cases our registrations are subject to annual review and such reviews may subject us to additional requirements in the future we may also be required to register or become subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in order to accept business from customers in those jurisdictions 

many aspects of our operations are subject to oversight and regulation by the cftc our activities relating to single stock and narrowbased stock index futures products are also subject to oversight by the sec our operations are subject to ongoing review and oversight including 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization changes in laws regulations or governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on the way we conduct our business 

the cftc has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with its rules and regulations we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations we also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the cftc or other agencies 

demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “selfregulation” that has been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program the cftc is conducting an ongoing review of selfregulatory organizations and the appropriate role if any of self regulation in the futures markets we cannot assure you that the cftc will not make modifications to its regulations as a result of its review any such modification or restructuring of our regulatory functions could entail material costs and may have an adverse effect on the way we conduct our business 

from time to time it is proposed in congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated including a possible merger between the cftc and the sec while those proposals have not been adopted to date the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely to the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us our business could be negatively affected 

the cftc is subject to reauthorization every five years which was scheduled to be completed in 2005 this process is still ongoing and could result in legislation that may have a negative impact on the way we operate our exchange including our ability to operate our selfregulatory functions or effectively compete with new entrants into our market place 

from time to time the president’s budget including the 2007 proposed budget includes a proposal that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions while those proposals have not been adopted to date except for a percontract fee imposed under the securities exchange act of 1934 on single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits 

  

our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

generally the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which can be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational legal and regulatory risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability 

many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks while we enjoy governmental immunity for some of our marketrelated activities we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we could be harmed by employee misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees including employees of gfx corporation our wholly owned subsidiary that primarily engages in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of cme customers or improper use of confidential information employee misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence or otherwise as well as regulatory actions for example employees of gfx corporation enter into transactions to promote liquidity in cme foreign exchange contracts on the cme globex platform and subsequently enter into offsetting transactions using futures contracts or spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market to limit market risk in the event the offsetting transaction is not entered into or is not timely or properly executed we could be exposed to substantial market risk 

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

we have experienced significant growth in our business continued growth may require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described in the following risk factor through acquisitions or other strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

  

our acquisition investment and alliance strategy involves risks if we are unable to effectively manage these risks our business will be materially harmed 

to achieve our strategic objectives in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies businesses or technologies acquisitions entail numerous risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we may not be able to integrate successfully any operations personnel services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future 

we also may seek to expand or enhance some of our operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest and potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners for example in 2001 we entered into an operating agreement governing onechicago our joint venture with the cboe and the cbot to trade single stock futures and futures based on narrowbased stock indexes we currently own approximately a 40 interest in the joint venture in 2005 we began a process to identify a possible strategic investor or investors in order to secure additional capital for onechicago and increase its chances of success this process is ongoing and we cannot assure you that the owners of onechicago including us will be able to complete a transaction with a strategic investor if we complete such a transaction our ownership interest in onechicago will likely be reduced our ability to control strategic decisions by onechicago or its board of directors is limited and it will be further reduced if we complete a transaction with a strategic investor we cannot assure you that any joint venture or alliance that we have entered into including onechicago or may enter into in the future will be successful 

the imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at or otherwise offset by a fungible position existing at another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business 

in connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the cfma contemplates that clearing houses will after an initial period establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house if in the future a similar requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 

expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

we plan to continue to expand our operations internationally including by directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we currently have direct customer access in more than 70 countries we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

 

  

  

   

  

 in addition as a result of our expanding global operations we may become subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities these may include laws rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business to date we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets we may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

we rely primarily on trade secret copyright service mark trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights we have filed several patent applications covering our technology in the united states and certain other jurisdictions notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights we also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law we have copyright registrations for certain of our software user manuals and databases the copyright protection afforded to databases however is fairly limited while the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable the actual data may not be and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function in some cases including a number of our most important products there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and electronic execution services 

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results

on october 14 2003 the us futures exchange llc or eurex us and us exchange holdings inc filed suit against the cbot and cme in the united states district court for the district of columbia the suit alleges that the cbot and cme violated the antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with the business relationship and contract between eurex us and the clearing corporation eurex us and us exchange holdings inc are seeking a preliminary injunction and treble damages on december 12 2003 the cbot and cme filed separate motions to dismiss or in the event the motion to dismiss is denied to move the venue to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois on september 2 2004 the judge granted the cbot’s and cme’s motion to transfer venue to the northern district of illinois in light of that decision the judge did not rule on the motions to dismiss on march 25 2005 eurex us filed a second amended complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois on june 6 2005 cme and the cbot filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on august 25 2005 the judge denied the joint cmecbot motion to dismiss the parties are currently engaged in discovery based on its investigation to date and advice from legal counsel we believe this suit is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against these charges 

in november 2002 a former employee filed a complaint against cme in the circuit court of cook county illinois seeking in excess of 3 million in damages which was subsequently amended to allege common law claims of retaliatory discharge in june 2003 the former employee filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois alleging that his employment was terminated because of his race in violation of title vii and that his employment termination violated section 1981 which prohibits discrimination in making and enforcing contracts the state court claims were subsequently dismissed and cme prevailed on its motion for summary judgment in federal court with the former employee’s appeal pending as of november 9 2005 the parties agreed to mutually dismiss all claims with neither party admitting liability nor paying any sum of money to the other party

we are the largest futures exchange in the united states for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts often called derivatives as measured by 2004 annual trading volume in 2004 our customers which include our members traded futures contracts and options on futures contracts with an underlying value of 463 trillion making us the world’s largest exchange by this measure we also have the largest futures and options on futures open interest of any exchange in the world as of december 31 2004 our open interest record was 285 million contracts set on december 9 2004 open interest is the number of outstanding contracts at the close of the trading day at the exchange and is a leading indicator of liquidity liquidity of markets or the ability of a market to quickly and efficiently absorb the execution of large purchases or sales is a key to attracting customers and contributing to a market’s success 

  

futures and options on futures provide a way to protect against – and potentially profit from – price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities futures contracts are legally binding agreements to buy or sell something in the future such as livestock or foreign currency the buyer and seller of a futures contract agree on a price today for a product to be delivered and paid for in the future each contract specifies the quantity of the item and the time of delivery or payment 

  

our products provide a means for hedging speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with interest rate sensitive instruments equity ownership changes in the value of foreign currency and changes in the prices of commodity products our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers supranational entities and governments 

  

as a marketplace for global risk management our exchange brings together buyers and sellers of derivatives products which trade on our cme ® globex ® electronic trading platform on our trading floors through open outcry and via privately negotiated transactions that we clear we offer market participants the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on interest rates equity indexes foreign exchange and commodities our key products include cme eurodollar contracts and contracts based on major us stock indexes including the sp 500 ® and the nasdaq100 ®  we also offer contracts for the principal foreign currencies and for a number of commodity products including cattle hogs and dairy we believe several of our key products serve as global financial benchmarks for example our cme eurodollar contract provides a benchmark for measuring the relative value of us dollardenominated shortterm fixedincome securities similarly our sp 500 index and nasdaq100 index contracts are closely linked to the benchmark indexes for us equity performance 

  

we own our clearing house which is the largest derivatives clearing operation in the world for futures and options on futures and we guarantee clear and settle every contract traded through our exchange as a result of our agreement to provide clearing and related services to the chicago board of trade or the cbot we now clear approximately 90 of all futures contracts and options on futures contracts in the united states during 2004 we processed an average of approximately 701000 and 365000 trade transactions per day for cme including our nontraditional trakrs contracts and cbot products respectively we currently have the capacity to clear more than 40 million trade transactions per day our systems are scalable and give us the ability to increase our capacity with little lead time as of 

  

december 31 2004 we acted as custodian for approximately 441 billion in performance bond collateral including 31 billion in deposits for noncme products in 2004 we moved an average of 15 billion of settlement funds through our clearing system each day in addition 50 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide have adopted our cme span ® risk evaluation system which is used to determine the appropriate performance bond requirements for trading portfolios 

  

cme was founded in 1898 as a notforprofit corporation in november 2000 we became the first us financial exchange to demutualize and become a shareholderowned corporation as a consequence we have adopted a forprofit approach to our business including strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing volume efficiency and liquidity we posted record trading volume of approximately 787 million contracts in 2004 an increase of approximately 27 over 2003 which was previously our busiest year 

  

we have a history of innovation in our industry in the 1960s we introduced the first livestock futures contract that resulted in the physical delivery of live cattle in 1972 we introduced the world’s first financial futures contracts when we launched seven foreign exchange futures contracts that innovation fundamentally changed the nature and scope of futures markets transforming them from agricultural hedging mechanisms to hedging and risk management markets for financial instruments and financial risks we also developed the first cashsettled futures in 1981 with the introduction of cme eurodollar futures which is one of the world’s most actively traded futures contracts cash settlement also enabled us to introduce in 1982 the first successful stock index futures contract the sp 500 futures in 1987 we pioneered the concept of global electronic trading of derivatives contracts and we subsequently launched the cme globex electronic trading platform in 1992 today most of our products trade electronically as well as on our open outcry trading floors in 1997 we introduced the first of the cme emini ™ stock index products which are smallersized electronically traded versions of our benchmark stock index futures contracts in april 2003 we entered into an agreement with the cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures contracts and options on futures contracts 

  

we devote substantial resources to introducing new products based on new markets or securities and increasing the distribution of our existing products in 2004 we launched japanese yen denominated nikkei 225 ™ stock index futures contracts futures and options on futures contracts based on three of the most commonly used varieties of fertilizer weather futures and options on futures for tokyo and osaka japan electronically traded futures contracts on the us consumer price index or cpi and equity index options on emini nasdaq100 futures contracts options on emini russell 2000 ® futures contracts the fourth most active stock index contract in the united states were launched in the first quarter of 2005 in addition in 2004 we announced our agreement with reuters transaction services limited or reuters to offer access to our electronic foreign exchange markets to reuters’ global customer base over the reuters dealing 3000 trading system this arrangement will give dealers in the interbank market direct access to our foreign exchange products in cash equivalent format and will enhance their ability to seamlessly trade foreign exchange spot forwards and futures to further expand access and increase efficiency of our cme globex platform throughout europe we added six telecommunications hubs in addition to the one we had in london in the key european financial centers of amsterdam dublin frankfurt gibraltar milan and paris to reduce connectivity costs for our pacific rim customers we also plan to establish our first asian hub in singapore in 2005 

  

trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by our members our members are individual traders as well as most of the world’s largest banks brokerages and investment houses prior to the introduction of our electronic trading platform our members traded only on our open outcry trading floors and through privately negotiated transactions today our members are able to conduct trading on our open outcry trading floors electronically on the cme globex platform and through privately negotiated transactions that we clear members who broker trades executed on our open outcry trading floors generally do not play a role in facilitating the execution of transactions on behalf of customers on the cme globex platform in 2004 volume on the cme globex electronic trading platform represented approximately 57 of our trading volume compared to approximately 42 in 2003 

  

prior to our demutualization direct access to our markets whether on our open outcry trading floors or through the cme globex platform was limited to members and those with an exchange permit who met specified qualifications in connection with our demutualization we opened access to our markets by allowing unlimited direct access to the cme globex platform for all market participants today any individual or institutional customer guaranteed by a clearing firm is able to obtain direct access to the cme globex platform as a result of the increased access to our markets all market participants now have the ability to view bids and offers in the market generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to encourage increased liquidity in our markets in 2004 our members were responsible for nearly 78 of our total trading volume 

  

as a result of our conversion into a forprofit corporation in the fall of 2000 individuals and entities who at the time were members and owned trading rights on our exchange became the owners of all our outstanding equity these individuals and entities continued to own substantially all of our outstanding equity following our reorganization into a holding company structure in december 2001 and our initial public offering in december 2002 we believe that owners of trading rights on our exchange continue to own a substantial amount of our class a common stock 

  

our principal executive offices are located at 20 south wacker drive chicago illinois 60606 and our telephone number is 3129301000 

  

competitive strengths 

  

we have established ourselves as a premier global marketplace for financial risk management we believe our principal competitive strengths are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

highly liquid markets the liquidity in our markets is a key factor in attracting and retaining customers we have the largest open interest of any exchange in the world of futures and options on futures contracts as of december 31 2004 our open interest record was 285 million contracts set on december 9 2004 during 2004 we posted record trading volume of approximately 787 million contracts an increase of approximately 27 over 2003 making us the most active exchange in the united states and the second most active in the world for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts during that period by notional or underlying value we are the largest futures exchange in the world with 463 trillion traded in 2004 

  

global benchmark products we believe our key products serve as global benchmarks for valuing and managing risk our cme eurodollar contract serves as a global benchmark for measuring the relative value of us dollardenominated shortterm fixedincome securities similarly the sp 500 nasdaq100 and russell indexes are considered primary tools for benchmarking investment performance against us equity market exposure our sp 500 nasdaq100 and russell index contracts which are based on these benchmarks are recognized by our customers as efficient tools for managing and hedging their equity market risks 

  

diverse portfolio of products and services we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing and offering to our customers a diverse array of products as well as a broad range of trade execution and clearing services we have a long history of developing innovative interest rate equity index foreign exchange and commodity products designed to appeal to institutional and individual customers we offer both open outcry auction trading and electronic ordermatching services and we provide facilities to clear privately negotiated transactions our markets provide important risk management tools to our customers which include leading global and financial institutions we work closely with our customers to create markets and products that meet their needs these relationships help us to anticipate and lead industry changes 

  

wholly owned clearing house we own our clearing house which guarantees clears and settles every contract traded through our exchange and futures and options on futures contracts traded through the cbot during 2004 we processed an average of approximately 701000 and 365000 trade transactions per day for cme including our nontraditional trakrs contracts and cbot products respectively we currently have the capacity to clear more than 40 million trade transactions per day and our scalable systems give us the ability to further increase our capacity with little lead time on september 24 2004 the clearing house surpassed one billion contracts cleared in 2004 in january 2004 we fully implemented our agreement with the cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures contracts and options on futures contracts as of december 31 2004 we acted as custodian for approximately 441 billion in performance bond collateral including 31 billion in deposits for noncme products and in 2004 moved an average of 15 billion of settlement funds through our clearing system each day we believe our performance guarantee is a major attraction to our markets particularly compared to the overthecounter or otc markets because it substantially reduces counterparty risk our clearing system permits more efficient use of capital for our customers by allowing netting of long and short positions in a single type of contract and providing risk offset and crossmargining arrangements with several other leading clearing houses in addition ownership of our clearing house enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development technology market regulation and other risk management activities our goal is to design our system to service historical peak volumes provide clearing services to the cbot and other exchanges and introduce new products with high volume potential 

  

proven and scalable technology we believe our ability to use technology effectively has been a key factor in the successful development of our business as a result of significant investments in our technology asset base we possess fast reliable and fully integrated trading and clearing systems our goal is to design our highly scalable systems to accommodate additional products with relatively limited modifications and low incremental costs the core components of our system infrastructure for trading clearing and risk management are becoming widely adopted throughout the futures industry resulting in common interfaces and efficiencies for intermediaries and customers for example our cme span risk evaluation system has been adopted by 50 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide 

  

global reach globalization of financial markets is expanding the customer base for futures products beyond traditional boundaries our electronic trading services which are available nearly 24 hours a day and five days per week position us to take advantage of this development we have established strategic relationships with other exchanges and clearing houses around the world to enable our customers to gain further capital and execution efficiencies these relationships are intended to extend the market reach of our global derivatives business in addition we expanded our telecommunications capacity in europe to include six new telecommunications hubs similar to our hub in london that was established in 2002 these hubs reduce connectivity costs and house direct electronic connections between the foreign customer and cme globex our electronic trading platform in 2005 we plan to establish our first asian telecommunications hub in singapore we also introduced new incentive programs for certain types of customers in europe and asia that have fueled our global expansion by attracting new customers to our products and markets worldwide 

  

growth strategy 

  

globalization deregulation and advances in technology offer significant opportunities for expanding futures markets and exchange markets generally we intend to increase our trading volumes revenues and profitability by capitalizing on these opportunities through implementation of the following four strategies 

  

   

   

   

   

expand our current core business we intend to advance our position as a leader in the futures industry by expanding customer access to our markets and services offering additional trade execution choices and enhancing our market data and information products 

  

   

   

   

add new products we develop new products and product line extensions based on research and development in collaboration with our customers and financial services firms we have created modified versions of some of our existing products in order to attract new types of customers for example we have introduced the following emini versions of our larger open outcrytraded futures contracts emini sp 500 emini nasdaq100 emini russell 1000 ®  emini russell 2000 emini sp midcap 400 ™ and emini nasdaq composite ®  by creating smallersized products and offering electronic trading services for them we have successfully expanded our customer base and overall volume we also seek to introduce new contracts that complement our existing product line we offer futures contracts based on the russell 1000 and russell 2000 indexes these contracts offer exposure to the russell 3000 ® universe of stocks representing 98 of the investable us equity market based on total market capitalization 

  

in 2004 we launched futures contracts on the japanese yen denominated nikkei 225 stock index futures and options on futures based on three of the most commonly used varieties of fertilizer weather futures and options on futures for tokyo and osaka japan electronically traded futures contracts on the cpi and equity options on our emini nasdaq100 futures contracts options on our emini russell 2000 futures contracts were launched in the first quarter of 2005 in addition in 2005 we will launch new euro fx and japanese yen options on futures contracts with europeanstyle expiration on the cme globex platform 

  

provide transaction processing services and other business services to third parties we intend to leverage our existing capacity scalable technology and business processes to provide a broad range of services to other exchanges clearing organizations and otc markets we intend to offer services including clearing and settlement processing and risk management market structuring product structuring and trade execution platforms we believe we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering some or all of these services on a costeffective basis in combination with the potential to access our broad distribution customer base and experienced liquidity providers users of our clearing services also have the potential to gain substantial capital and collateral efficiencies for their clearing firms in january 2004 we fully implemented our agreement with the cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts the arrangement provides clearing firms and customers with the potential to gain operational performance bond and capital efficiencies as well as a combined risk capital pool and other expected cost savings as a result of our agreement with the cbot our clearing house is the largest derivatives clearing operation for futures and options on futures in the world and we now clear approximately 90 of all futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded in the united states in 2004 we cleared 600 million contracts for the cbot open interest for cbot contracts was 99 million contracts as of december 31 2004 

  

pursue select alliances and acquisitions we plan to supplement our internal growth through the formation of joint ventures or alliances and select acquisitions of businesses or technologies we will seek alliances and acquisitions that help us to enter new markets provide services that we currently do not offer open access to our markets or advance our technology for example we acquired the technologyrelated assets and intellectual property of liquidity direct in january 2004 to acquire new options and spread trading technology to enhance the growth of cme eurodollar options and ultimately other options markets on the cme globex platform in may 2004 we entered into an agreement with reuters to offer our electronic foreign exchange markets to reuters’ 

  

global customer base in cash equivalent format and to provide reuters dealing 3000 interbank dealer customers with direct access to our foreign exchange products this initiative scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2005 will open our markets to a new group of potential users 

  

products 

  

our broad range of products includes futures contracts and options on futures contracts based on interest rates equity indexes foreign exchange and commodities our products are traded through our open outcry auction markets through the cme globex electronic trading platform or in privately negotiated transactions that we clear for the year ended december 31 2004 we derived 5530 million or 75 of our net revenues from fees associated with trading and clearing our products these fees include per contract charges for trade execution clearing and cme globex fees fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded the method of trade and the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade generally members are charged lower fees than nonmembers certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to encourage increased liquidity in our markets our markets also generate valuable data and information regarding pricing and trading activity in our products revenues from market data products totaled 609 million or 8 of our net revenues in 2004 

  

we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers 

  

the following table shows the total notional value and average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product lines for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

interest rate products our interest rate products include our global benchmark cme eurodollar futures contract eurodollars are us dollar bank deposits outside the united states eurodollar futures contracts are shortterm interest rate products and constitute one of the most successful products in our industry and one of the most actively traded futures contracts in the world open interest in cme eurodollar futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded on our exchange was 183 million contracts as of december 31 2004 representing a notional value of 183 trillion we also trade contracts based on other shortterm interest rates such as onemonth libor which stands for the london interbank offered rate and euroyen interest rate products represented approximately 55 of our trading volume during 2004 an average of approximately 17 million contracts per day 

  

the growth of our cme eurodollar futures market has been driven by the general acceptance of the us dollar as the principal reserve currency for financial institutions throughout the world as a result eurodollar deposits have significance in the international capital markets participants in the eurodollar futures market are generally major domestic and international banks and other financial institutions that face interest rate risks from their lending and borrowing activities their activities as dealers in otc interest rate swaps and structured derivatives products and their proprietary trading activities many of these participants use cme eurodollar and other interest rate contracts to hedge or arbitrage their money market swaps or convert their interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a floating rate or a floating rate to a fixed rate asset managers also use our interest rate products to lengthen the effective maturity of shortterm investment assets by buying futures contracts or shorten the effective maturity by selling futures cme contracts are an attractive alternative when physical restructuring of a portfolio is not possible or when futures transaction costs are lower than the cash market transaction costs 

  

in 1999 we initiated simultaneous sidebyside electronic trading in our cme eurodollar contract trading in cme eurodollar contracts often involves complex trading strategies that we believe cannot be fully accommodated by existing electronic trading platforms we continue to develop and implement new electronic functionality to accommodate trading strategies required for electronic trading of eurodollar contracts in august 2004 we launched our enhanced options system for electronic trading of options on cme eurodollars for a limited group of market participants this system is designed to facilitate trading of complex 

  

combination and spread trades typically used with shortterm interest rate options on futures within a fully transparent and competitive execution environment to make the enhanced functionality available to the entire marketplace we plan to link the system with the cme globex platform in the second half of 2005 in addition in october 2004 we introduced new implied spread trading functionality for cme eurodollars on cme globex this functionality added the capability to more efficiently establish and liquidate certain spread positions within the first three years of the tenyear yield curve in 2004 electronic average daily volume of cme eurodollars increased to approximately 593000 contracts from approximately 45000 in 2003 we intend to introduce more functionality that will accommodate other complex trading strategies electronically 

  

we intend to increase our revenues from our interest rate product sector by optimizing pricing of existing products introducing new products to increase our trading volume and enhancing the functionality of our cme globex electronic platform through the integration of our enhanced options system to increase the electronic trading volume of our options on futures contracts we have been active in adopting new policies and practices that are closely aligned with customer demand and designed to promote enhanced market penetration 

  

equity index products we began offering stock index futures in 1982 stock index futures products permit investors to obtain exposure for hedging or speculative purposes to a change in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities we offer trading in futures contracts based upon the sp 500 index nasdaq100 index certain russell indexes and other small medium and largecapitalization domestic indexes and indexes on foreign equity markets as of december 31 2004 our market share in all us listed stock index futures was approximately 92 based on the number of contracts traded 

  

our total trading volume for stock index products rose 10 in 2004 to 294 million contracts from 266 million contracts in 2003 trading in stock index futures products represented approximately 37 of our total trading volume during 2004 an average of nearly 12 million contracts per day in 2004 approximately 92 of our stock index futures trading volume was based on the sp 500 index and the nasdaq100 index 

  

standard  poor’s corporation designed and maintains the sp 500 index to be a proxy for a diversified equity portfolio representing a broad crosssection of the us equity markets the index is based on the stock prices of 500 largecapitalization companies we have an exclusive license with standard  poor’s until 2008 the nasdaq100 index is based on the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks listed on the nasdaq national market we have a license with nasdaq that allows us to offer the nasdaq100 index and nasdaq composite contracts exclusively until october 2011 for a more detailed discussion of these license agreements see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—licensing agreements” our standard size sp and nasdaq contracts are traded through our open outcry facilities during regular trading hours and on the cme globex platform after the close of open outcry trading 

  

in addition to contracts based on the sp 500 and nasdaq100 indexes we also offer the following equity futures and options on futures contracts emini nasdaq composite sp midcap 400 russell 2000 nikkei 225 and the goldman sachs commodity index ®  we also offer seven trakrs contracts trakrs are a series of nontraditional futures contracts developed with merrill lynch  co inc and licensed exclusively to us for north america and are the first broadbased index products traded on a us futures exchange that can be sold by securities brokers trakrs are designed to enable customers to track an index of stocks bonds currencies or other financial instruments 

  

we believe the variety of our stock index futures products appeals to a broad group of equity investors these investors include public and private pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets 

  

in 1997 we launched our emini sp 500 futures contracts we followed this new product offering with the introduction of emini nasdaq100 futures contracts in 1999 emini contracts are traded exclusively on our electronic cme globex platform and are onefifth the size of their standard counterparts these products are designed to address the growing demand for stock index derivatives and electronically traded products from individual traders and small institutions trading volumes in these products have grown rapidly  achieving new volume and open interest records during 2004 and 2003 this growth is attributable to the benefits of stock index futures electronic market access and prior to 2003 significant volatility in the us equity markets we also trade the emini russell 2000 emini russell 1000 emini sp midcap 400 and emini nasdaq composite 

  

we believe our leading market position in equity index products is a result of the liquidity of our markets the status of the sp 500 index and the nasdaq100 index as two of the principal us financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns and the appeal to investors and traders of our emini products and our cme globex platform we believe future growth in our stock index products will come from the introduction of electronically traded options on our existing equity index products including our eminis expanding customer access to our electronic markets enhancing the functionality of our cme globex electronic platform to increase the electronic trading volume of our options on futures contracts as well as further educating the marketplace on the benefits of these products 

  

foreign exchange products we became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in 1972 institutions such as banks hedge funds commodity trading advisors corporations and individuals use these products to manage their risks associated with or speculate on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates foreign exchange products represented nearly 7 of our trading volume in 2004 an average of approximately 202000 contracts per day we offer futures and options on futures contracts on 36 currencies including the euro japanese yen british pound swiss franc canadian dollar mexican peso australian dollar brazilian real new zealand dollar and south african rand 

  

our total foreign exchange trading volume increased 51 during 2004 from 2003 we have begun improving the performance of this product sector by expanding the distribution of our foreign exchange products through the cme globex platform and by establishing incentive programs to increase volume we introduced sidebyside electronic and open outcry trading of foreign exchange futures in april 2001 we believe this change has helped facilitate the increase in volume in these products in 2004 electronically traded foreign exchange futures volume increased approximately 127 over 2003 from 149 million contracts to 340 million contracts open outcry trading decreased approximately 14 from 115 million contracts in 2003 to 99 million contracts in 2004 

  

we expect the growth in our foreign exchange product line to come from further transitioning to electronic trading and through our new distribution agreement with reuters this will allow us to compete more effectively in an environment where electronic execution is growing rapidly and accounts for a significant portion of global foreign exchange volume the foreign exchange interbank spot market is heavily reliant on electronic trading with the majority of trades brokered online we continue to increase both functionality and distribution 

  

commodity products commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business we have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products including futures contracts based on cattle hogs pork bellies lumber weather and dairy products commodity products accounted for 1 of our trading volume during 2004 an average of more than 40000 contracts per day and an increase of approximately 13 from 2003 on january 11 2005 we had our highest volume day ever with nearly 100000 contracts traded these products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities including agricultural producers of commodities and food processors our commodity products are traded through our open outcry and electronic trading execution facilities and through privately negotiated transactions 

  

we believe continuing consolidation and restructuring in the agricultural sector coupled with the reduction or elimination of government subsidies and the resulting increase in demand for risk management in this sector provide an opportunity for growth in our commodity markets as more producers and processors adopt formal hedging and risk management programs we intend to leverage our experience in trading futures on physical commodities to jointly develop new commodity products with operators of electronic cash and derivatives trading platforms 

  

market data and information products our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products the market data we supply is central to trading activity in our products and to trading activity in related cash and derivatives markets we sell our market data which includes information about bids offers trades and trade size to banks brokerdealers pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions we distribute our market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets through our electronic facilities we also distribute market data via dedicated networks to approximately 210 worldwide quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges other third party data providers and news services and then resell their consolidated data as of december 31 2004 approximately 63000 subscribers displayed our data on approximately 179000 screens revenues from market data products totaled 609 million or 8 of our net revenues in 2004 

  

we continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by packaging the basic data we have traditionally offered with advanced analytical data and information we have created marketing programs to increase the use of our market data 

  

execution 

  

our trade execution facilities consist of our open outcry trading floors and the cme globex electronic trading platform both of these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency and are stateoftheart trading environments supported by substantial infrastructure and technology for order routing trade reporting market data dissemination and market surveillance and regulation in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house the following chart shows the range of trade execution choices we provide our customers in some of our key products 

  

   

open outcry trading open outcry trading represented approximately 41 of our total trading volume in 2004 the trading floors are the centralized meeting place for floor traders and floor brokers representing customer orders to trade contracts the trading floors covering approximately 70000 square feet have tiered booths surrounding the pits from which clearing firm personnel can communicate with customers regarding current market activity and prices and receive orders either electronically or by telephone in addition our trading floors display current market information and news on electronic wallboards hung above the pits during 2004 nearly 32 of our clearing and transaction fee revenues were derived from open outcry trading 

  

cme globex electronic trading platform the cme globex electronic trading platform maintains an electronic centralized order book and trade execution algorithm for futures contracts and options on futures contracts and allows users to enter orders directly into the order book initially our electronic trading platform was used to offer our products to customers after the close of our regular daytime trading sessions today however we trade some of our most successful products on the cme globex platform nearly 24 hours a day five days a week in 2004 approximately 57 of our trading volume was executed using cme globex compared to approximately 42 in 2003 this was the first year that total volume traded on the cme globex platform exceeded total volume traded on open outcry electronic trading volume has increased from approximately 35 million contracts in 2000 to more than 451 million contracts in 2004 on october 19 2004 the one billionth contract was traded on the cme globex platform since it was launched in 1992 during 2004 nearly 61 of our clearing and transaction fee revenues were derived from electronic trading 

  

privately negotiated transactions in addition to offering traditional open outcry and electronic trading through the cme globex platform we permit qualified customers to trade our products by entering into privately negotiated transactions which are reported and included in the market data we distribute we also clear settle and guarantee these transactions through our clearing house some market participants value privately negotiated transactions as a way to ensure that large transactions can be completed at a single price or in a single transaction while preserving their ability to effectively complete a hedging risk management or other trading strategy during 2004 approximately 7 of our clearing and transaction fee revenues were derived from this type of trading 

  

our privately negotiated transactions include exchange for physical or efp transactions exchange basis facility or ebf transactions and block trades both efp and ebf trades involve a futures contract and a spot commodity or cash position the term efp is used with all of these types of futures transactions except interest rate transactions which are referred to as ebfs a block trade is the privately negotiated purchase and sale of futures contracts block trading was introduced on our exchange in late 2000 and volume has been limited to date we believe block trading provides an important source of access designed to appeal to largescale institutional traders originally these transactions were limited to a certain number of contracts and required high minimum quantity thresholds along with a fee surcharge we have implemented pricing and trading rules designed to increase customer participation we intend to continue to enhance the utility of privately negotiated transactions while maintaining an appropriate balance with the transactions conducted within the open outcry and electronic trading environments 

  

clearing 

  

we operate our own clearing house that clears settles and guarantees the performance of all transactions matched through our execution facilities and futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded through the cbot many derivatives exchanges do not provide clearing services for trades matched through their execution facilities relying instead on outside clearing houses to provide these services ownership and control of our own clearing house enables us to capture the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products this is particularly important for trade execution alternatives such as block trades where we can derive a higher clearing fee for each contract traded compared to other trades by owning our clearing house we also control the cost structure and the technology development cycle for our clearing services it also helps us manage our new product initiatives without being dependent on an outside entity we believe having an integrated clearing function provides significant competitive advantages additionally owning our own clearing house allows us to provide clearing services to other exchanges such as the cbot 

  

on september 24 2004 the clearing house surpassed one billion contracts cleared in 2004 we processed an average of approximately 701000 trade transactions per day in 2004 for cme products including our nontraditional trakrs products with an average transaction size of 91 contracts we maintain the largest futures and options on futures open interest of any exchange in the world as of december 31 2004 our open interest stood at 225 million contracts as of such date our open interest record was 285 million contracts set on december 9 2004 as of december 31 2004 we acted as custodian for approximately 441 billion in performance bond collateral deposited by our clearing firms and during 2004 we moved an average of approximately 15 billion a day in settlement funds through our clearing system in addition our clearing house guarantees the performance of our contracts with a financial safeguards package of approximately 40 billion 

  

in january 2004 we fully implemented our agreement with the cbot for us to provide clearing and transaction processing services in providing these services to the cbot our clearing house clears settles and guarantees all cbot transactions using the full resources of our clearing processes and financial safeguards package open interest in cbot products cleared by our clearing house on december 31 2004 was 99 million contracts 

  

the clearing function provides three primary benefits to our markets efficient highvolume transaction processing cost and capital efficiencies and a reliable credit guarantee the services we provide can be broadly categorized as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

transaction processing and position management we developed a stateoftheart clearing system clearing 21 ®  in conjunction with nymex to provide high quality clearing services this system processes reported trades and positions on a realtime basis providing users with instantaneous information on trades positions and risk exposure clearing 21 is able to process trades in futures and options products securities and cash instruments clearing 21 can also support complex new product types including combinations options on combinations options on options swaps repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other instruments through clearing 21 user interfaces our clearing firms can electronically manage their positions exercise options enter transactions related to foreign exchange deliveries manage collateral posted to meet performance bond requirements and access all of our other online applications together with our order routing and trade matching services we offer straightthrough electronic processing of transactions in which an order is electronically routed matched cleared and made available to the clearing firm’s backoffice systems for further processing 

  

crossmargining and mutual offset services we have led the derivatives industry in establishing crossmargining agreements with other leading clearing houses crossmargining arrangements reduce capital costs for clearing firms and customers these agreements permit an individual clearing house to recognize a clearing firm’s open positions at other participating clearing houses and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at other participating clearing houses this reduces the need for collateral deposits by the clearing firm for example our crossmargining program with the options clearing corporation reduced performance bond requirements for our members by approximately 16 billion a day in the fourth quarter of 2004 we have implemented crossmargining arrangements with the fixed income clearing corporation formerly the government securities clearing corporation and lchclearnet group for positions at the london international financial futures and options exchange in addition our mutual offset agreement with the singapore derivatives exchange which has been in place since 1984 allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products and then transfer them back to the originating exchange this mutual offset arrangement enables firms to seamlessly execute trades at either exchange virtually 24 hours per day 

  

market protection and risk management our clearing house guarantee of performance is a significant attraction and an important part of the functioning of our exchange because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract netting process provides our customers with significant flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions 

  

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products our clearing house uses our proprietary cme span software which determines the appropriate performance bond requirements by simulating the gains and losses of complex portfolios we typically hold performance bond collateral to cover at least 95 of price changes for a given product within a given historical period performance bond requirements for a clearing firm’s or customer’s overall portfolio are calculated using cme span 

  

at each settlement cycle our clearing house values at the market price prevailing at that time or markstomarket all open positions and requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value our clearing house markstomarket all open positions at least twice a day and more often if market volatility warrants markingtomarket provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract 

  

having a marktomarket cycle of a minimum of two times a day helps protect the financial integrity of our clearing house our clearing firms and market participants this allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions 

  

in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the clearing firm to cover its payment obligation these assets include security deposits performance bonds and any other available assets such as the proceeds from the sale of class a and class b common stock and memberships of the clearing firm at our exchange owned by or assigned to the clearing firm in addition we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent of a clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our surplus funds security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit we have a secured committed 750 million line of credit with a consortium of banks in order to provide additional liquidity to address a clearing firm payment default the credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as security deposit funds in our second interest earning facility program called ief2 to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line this line of credit may also be utilized if there is a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay settlement payments between our clearing house and clearing firms 

  

the following shows the available assets of our clearing house at december 31 2004 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm 

  

cme clearing house available assets 

in millions 

  

          

settlement collateral and delivery services we manage final settlement in all of our contracts including cash settlement physical delivery of selected commodities and option exercises and assignments because some initial and maintenance performance bonds from clearing firms as well as marktomarket obligations on some of our contracts are denominated in various foreign currencies we offer multicurrency margin and settlement services we also offer the moneychanger service to our clearing firms this service provides members with access to overnight funds in various foreign currencies at competitive bidask spreads free of charge to satisfy the terms of a foreign currency denominated futures contract 

  

although more than 95 of all futures contracts are liquidated before the expiration of the contract the underlying financial instruments or commodities for the remainder of the contracts must be delivered we act as the delivery agent for all contracts ensuring timely delivery by the seller of the exact quality and quantity specified in a contract and full and timely payment by the buyer 

  

in order to administer its system of financial safeguards efficiently our clearing house has developed banking relationships with a network of major us banks and banking industry infrastructure providers such as the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications among the key services provided to our clearing house by these banks and service providers are a variety of custody credit and payment services that support the substantial financial commitments and processes backing the guarantee of our clearing house to market participants 

  

investment services in order to achieve collateral efficiencies for our clearing firms we have established a number of collateral programs under the designation interest earning facility or ief ®  the first iefs were organized in 1997 as two managed funds with interest earned net of expenses passed on to the participating clearing firms the principal of the first iefs is guaranteed by us we believe that the market risk exposure relating to our guarantee of the principal is not material to the financial statements taken as a whole in 2002 ief2 was organized ief2 offers clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in shares of approved money market mutual funds dividends earned on these shares net of fees are solely for the account of the clearing firm on whose behalf the shares were purchased the principal of ief2 is not guaranteed by us in 2003 ief3 was launched in 2004 ief4 and ief5 were launched ief3 and ief4 are specialized collateral programs that utilize various services and methods of processing that are most typically associated with triparty repossession unlike the first ief and the ief2 programs these programs do not employ an interest rate component these programs allow clearing firms to pledge a wider range of collateral than we have typically accepted ief5 is an interestbearing cash deposit account recorded on the trust ledger of jp morgan chase bank as of december 31 2004 there was more than 192 billion in balances in these programs compared to 144 billion at december 31 2003 we earn fee income in return for providing these valueadded services to our clearing firms 

  

our clearing house launched a securities lending program in 2001 using a portion of certain securities deposited to meet the proprietary performance bond requirements of our clearing firms under this securities lending program we lend a security to a third party and receive collateral in the form of cash the majority of the cash is then invested on an overnight basis to generate interest income the related interest expense represents payment to the borrower of the security for the cash collateral retained during the duration of the lending transaction securities on loan are markedtomarket daily and compared to collateral received 

  

technology 

  

our operation of both trading facilities and a clearing house has influenced the design and implementation of the technologies that support our operations 

  

trading technology we have a proven track record of operating successful open outcry and electronic markets by developing and integrating multiple evolving technologies that support a growing and substantial trading volume the integrated suite of technologies we employ to accomplish this has been designed to support a significant expansion of our current business and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our technology base into new markets products and services 

  

as electronic trading activity expands we continue to provide greater match engine functionality unique to various markets market models and product types we have adopted a modular approach to technology development and engineered an integrated set of solutions that support multiple specialized markets we continually monitor and upgrade our capacity requirements our goal is to design our systems to handle at least twice our historical peak transactions in our highest volume products significant investments in production planning quality assurance and certification processes have enhanced our ability to expedite the delivery of the system enhancements that we develop for our customers 

  

speed reliability scalability capacity and functionality are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms a substantial portion of our operating budget is dedicated to system design development and operations in order to achieve high levels of overall system performance in 2004 we expanded our existing remote data facility and leased a second site to provide additional system capacity and redundancy for our trading and clearing technology our first remote data center features a unique network to enhance database and order routing servers and to improve overall system performance and functionality our data centers support our customer interfaces trading and execution systems as well as clearing and settlement operations 

  

the technology systems supporting our trading operations can be divided into four major categories 

  

   

the cme globex electronic trading platform includes the distribution order routing order management and trade matching technology the modularity and functionality of cme globex enable us to selectively add products with unique trading characteristics onto the trading platform with minimal additional investment 

  

the distribution technologies we offer differentiate our platform and bring liquidity and trading volume to our execution facilities as of december 31 2004 nearly 1150 customers connected directly with us and thousands more connected with us through 22 independent software vendors and data centers as well as all clearing firms that have interfaces with our systems many of these customers connect through a dedicated private framerelay network that is readily available has wide distribution and provides fast connections in the americas europe and asia we have initiated efforts to provide additional access choices to customers in early 2001 we implemented a webbased virtual private network solution cme globex traderinternet for our lowervolume customers this added a lowcost alternative that was the first of its kind among major exchanges approximately 250 customers currently use cme globex traderinternet in 2004 we also established telecommunications hubs in amsterdam dublin frankfurt gibraltar milan and paris in addition to our preexisting london hub and plan to add another hub in singapore in 2005 to respond to customer requests and bring down the cost of trading for certain foreign customers 

  

in order routing and management we offer a range of mechanisms and were among the first us derivatives exchanges to fully implement the fix 42 protocol—the standard order routing protocol used within the securities industry in addition our order routing and order management systems are capable of supporting multiple electronic trading match engines this functionality gives us great latitude in the types of markets that we choose to serve 

  

several key technology platforms and standards are used to support these activities including faulttolerant nonstop tandem systems ibm mainframes sun microsystems and hp servers hp and dell pcs oracle and db2 databases linux unix windows nt novell unicenter tng software systems tibco middleware and multivendor frame relay and virtual private network solutions 

  

our match engine is based upon the computerized trading and match software known as the nsc system we have a longterm license from euronextparis under which we have the ability to modify and upgrade the performance of the basic nsc system to optimize its performance to suit our needs we have a fully trained development team that maintains upgrades and customizes our version of the nsc system for example despite a large increase in trading volume we reduced the average customer response time from approximately 017 seconds at the beginning of 2004 to approximately 011 seconds at yearend allowing trades to be executed more quickly and consistently the customized enhancements that we have developed address the unique trading demands of each marketplace that we serve we continue to focus on performance features of the match engine and presently have multiple enhancements under development 

  

clearing technology clearing 21 our clearing and settlement software and cme span our margining and risk management software form the core of our clearing technology 

  

clearing 21 is a system for highvolume highcapacity clearing and settlement of exchangebased transactions that we developed jointly with nymex the system offers clearing firms improved efficiency and reduced costs clearing 21’s modular design gives us the ability to rapidly introduce new products the software can be customized to meet the unique needs of specialized markets 

  

cme span is our sophisticated margining and risk management software cme span has now been adopted by 50 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide this software simulates the effects of changing market conditions on a complex portfolio and uses standard options pricing models to determine a portfolio’s overall risk cme span then generates a performance bond requirement that typically covers 95 of price changes within a given historical period 

  

strategic relationships 

  

chicago board of trade in april 2003 we entered into an agreement with the cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts we began providing clearing services for cbot’s commodity equity index and a subset of cbot’s interest rate products on november 24 2003 and as of january 2 2004 we began clearing all of cbot’s remaining products in providing services to the cbot our clearing house clears settles and guarantees all cbot transactions using the full resources of our clearing processes and financial safeguards package we cleared 600 million contracts for the cbot in 2004 open interest for cbot contracts was 99 million contracts at december 31 2004 

  

china foreign exchange trading system  national interbank funding center in june 2004 we announced that we had entered into a memorandum of understanding with the china foreign exchange trading system  national interbank funding center or cfets under the terms of the agreement cfets will provide cme with information on the money and foreign exchange market in china including regulations and policies market specifications and development conditions and cme will provide information on international foreign exchange derivatives market practices products and regulations cme will also provide assistance on the design of derivatives products business development marketing and training 

  

new york mercantile exchange since 2002 we have jointly operated a cooperative arrangement with nymex to introduce smallsized versions of key nymex energy futures contracts called eminy sm energy futures for trading on our cme globex electronic trading platform and clearing at the nymex clearing house as part of the agreement we offered a crossmargining program creating capital efficiencies for market professionals and proprietary accounts by calculating performance bond requirements based on specified positions in both markets we also made cme globex terminals available to nymex market participants on the nymex trading floor in december 2004 we notified nymex of our decision to terminate the agreement which termination will take effect in june 2005 under the terms of the agreement we are generally prohibited until june 2006 other than in cooperation with nymex from providing for or facilitating electronic trading in futures or options on futures contracts on any underlying commodity or index of such commodities that was also the underlying commodity for a product listed for trading by nymex as of june 2002 

  

reuters in may 2004 we entered into an agreement with reuters to offer access to our electronic foreign exchange markets to reuters’ global customer base over the reuters dealing 3000 trading system this arrangement will give dealers in the interbank market direct access to our foreign exchange products in cash equivalent format and will enhance their ability to seamlessly trade foreign exchange spot forwards and futures this initiative is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2005 

  

shanghai futures exchange in march 2003 we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the shanghai futures exchange or shfe to pursue joint business development initiatives in derivatives products the agreement is the first of its kind between shfe and a north american exchange 

  

singapore derivatives exchange ltd in 1984 we entered into a mutual offset agreement with the singapore derivatives exchange and in november 2003 we entered into an extension of the agreement this relationship allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products then transfer them back to the originating exchange 

  

tokyo stock exchange in october 2000 we signed a nonbinding letter of intent to pursue a global alliance with the tokyo stock exchange with the goal of further developing our respective fixedincome and equity derivatives markets in march 2002 we introduced sptopix 150 ™ stock index futures on our electronic cme globex platform during the hours they are not available on the tokyo stock exchange 

  

marketing programs and advertising 

  

our marketing programs primarily target institutional customers and to a lesser extent individual traders our marketing programs for institutional customers aim to inform traders portfolio managers corporate treasurers and other market professionals about novel uses of our products such as new hedging and risk management strategies we also strive to educate these users about changes in product design performance bond requirements and new clearing services we participate in major domestic and international trade shows and seminars regarding futures contracts and options on futures contracts and other derivatives products in addition we sponsor educational workshops and marketing events designed to educate market users about our products through these relationships and programs we attempt to understand the needs of our customer base and use information provided by them to drive our product development efforts 

  

our advertising strategies seek to increase awareness and perceptions of us among our institutional and retail customers as well as support an increase in our trading volume our primary method of advertising has been through print media utilizing trade magazines and newsletters as well as daily business publications however we also use online television sponsorship and other targeted advertisements such as our advertisements at o’hare international airport to reach our audiences 

  

competition 

  

prior to the passage of the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 or cfma futures trading was generally required to take place on or subject to the rules of a federally designated contract market the costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation complying with applicable regulatory requirements establishing efficient execution facilities and liquidity pools and attracting customers created significant barriers to entry for competing exchanges the cfma eroded the historical dominance by the exchanges of futures trading in the united states by among other things eliminating uncertainty with respect to the enforceability of private transactions in most futures contracts and similar products authorizing the use of electronic trading systems to conduct both private and public futures transactions and lowering or eliminating entry barriers for new exchanges for a more detailed description of the regulation of our industry and the regulatory changes brought on by the cfma see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

  

the cfma and other changing market dynamics have led to increasing competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different domestic and international sources of varied size business objectives and resources we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges otc markets and clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and other competitors 

  

at yearend 2004 there were 56 futures exchanges located in 29 countries including 9 futures exchanges in the united states in february 2004 eurex commenced operation of its us derivatives exchange us futures exchange llc or eurex us eurex us’s initial competitive efforts were directed at the cbot however eurex us has expanded its product offerings to include futures based on the russell 1000 and russell 2000 indexes in direct competition with us in addition in march 2004 euronextliffe began listing and trading eurodollar futures contracts additionally because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets we also compete with securities and options exchanges including the new york stock exchange and the chicago board options exchange or cboe dealer markets such as nasdaq and alternative trading systems 

  

otc markets for foreign exchange and fixedincome derivatives products also compete with us the largest foreign exchange markets are operated primarily as electronic trading systems two of the largest of these operated by electronic brokering services and reuters plc serve primarily professional foreign exchange trading firms additional electronic platforms designed to serve corporate foreign exchange users are beginning to emerge two of these are operated by consortia of interdealer and interbank market participants a third is a proprietary trading system in addition certain provisions of the cfma have led to an increase in unregulated electronic and brokerage trading systems in the foreign exchange market a recent decision of the united states court of appeals may also make it easier for unregistered organizations to conduct futureslike transactions with retail customers these systems present significant potential competitive challenges to the growth of our foreign exchange futures markets 

  

the otc fixedincome derivatives market is by far the largest fixedincome derivatives marketplace the otc market consists primarily of interbank and interdealer market participants there is currently no single liquidity pool in the otc fixedincome derivatives market that is comparable to our eurodollar markets the otc market for fixedincome derivatives products has traditionally been limited to more customized products and the large credit exposures created in this market and the absence of clearing facilities have limited participation to the most creditworthy institutional participants however the size of this market and technologydriven developments in electronic trading and clearing facilities as well as regulatory changes implemented by the cfma increase the likelihood that one or more substantial liquidity pools will emerge in the future in the otc fixedincome derivatives market 

  

alternative trade execution facilities that currently specialize in the trading of equity securities have electronic trade execution and routing systems that also can be used to trade products that compete with our products 

  

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent potential competitors because as purveyors of market data these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities as technology firms they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks additionally technology and software firms that develop trading systems hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets 

  

we also face a threat of trading volume loss if a significant number of our traditional participants decide to trade futures or similar products among themselves without using any exchange or specific trading system the cfma allows nearly all of our largest customers to transact futures or similar products directly with each other while those transactions raise liquidity and credit concerns they may be attractive based on execution costs flexibility of terms negotiability of margin or collateral deposits or other considerations additionally changes under the cfma permitting the establishment of standalone clearing facilities for futures and otc derivatives transactions will facilitate the mitigation of creditrisk concentrations arising from such transactions 

  

we believe competition among exchanges in the derivatives and securities businesses is based on a number of factors including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets breadth of product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and functionality and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs 

  

our business is highly competitive we expect competition to continue to intensify particularly as a result of technological advances and the cfma and other changes introduced by the commodity futures trading commission or cftc that have reduced the regulatory requirements for the development and entry of products and markets that are competitive with our own additional factors that may intensify competition in the future include an increase in the number of forprofit exchanges the consolidation of our customer base or intermediary base an increased acceptance of electronic trading and electronic order routing by our customer base and the ability of other exchanges leveraging their technology investment and electronic distribution to enter new markets and list the products of other exchanges 

  

in addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services including 

  

   

   

we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the cost of the services provided quality and reliability of the services timely delivery of the services reputation and value of linking with existing products markets and distribution 

  

regulatory matters 

  

the commodity exchange act the scope of which was significantly expanded in 1974 subjected us to comprehensive regulation by the cftc under the 1974 amendments the cftc was granted exclusive jurisdiction over futures contracts and options on such contracts and on commodities such contracts were generally required to be traded on regulated exchanges known as contract markets the commodity exchange act placed our business in a heavily regulated environment but imposed significant barriers to unregulated competition 

  

between 1974 and december 2000 the barriers against unregulated competitors were eroded the commodity exchange act’s exchange trading requirement was modified by cftc regulations and interpretations to permit privately negotiated swap contracts meeting specified requirements to be transacted in the otc market as of june 2004 according to data from the bank for international settlements the total estimated notional amount of outstanding otc derivatives contracts was approximately 220 trillion compared to approximately 53 trillion for exchangetraded futures and options on futures contracts the cftc exemption and interpretations under which the otc derivatives market operated precluded the otc market from using exchangelike electronic transaction systems and clearing facilities 

  

the cfma significantly altered the regulatory landscape and may have important competitive consequences this legislation greatly expanded the freedom of regulated markets like ours to innovate and respond to competition it also permits us to offer a previously prohibited set of products—single stock futures and futures on narrowbased indexes of securities the provisions that permit us to trade these security futures products require a novel sharing of jurisdiction between the cftc and the securities and exchange commission or sec exchange trading of these security futures products is subject to more burdensome regulation than our other futures products for example in order to trade these products we are required to “notice register” with the sec as a special purpose national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading security futures products and the sec is authorized to review some of our rules relating to these security futures products our members trading those products are subject to registration requirements and duties and obligations to customers under the securities laws that do not pertain to their other futures business 

  

the cfma excluded or exempted many of the activities of our nonexchange competitors from regulation under the commodity exchange act the cfma created broad exclusions and exemptions from the commodity exchange act that permit derivatives contracts which may serve the same or similar functions as the contracts we offer to be sold in the largely unregulated otc market including through electronic trading facilities 

  

additionally the cfma permits secregulated and bank clearing organizations to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that such clearing organizations have traditionally cleared the cfma also permits banks and brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to offer and sell foreign exchange futures to retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act 

  

the cfma created a new flexible regulatory framework for us in our capacity as a cftc registrant and eliminated many prescriptive requirements of the commodity exchange act and cftc in favor of more broad and flexible core principles for instance cftcregulated exchanges may now list new contracts and adopt new rules without prior cftc approval under selfcertification procedures permitting more timely product launch and modification 

  

for regulated markets the cfma creates a new threetiered regulatory structure the degree of regulation is related to the characteristics of the product and the type of customer that has direct or indirect access to the market with retail customer markets being subject to greater regulation the new threetiered regulatory structure is as follows 

  

   

   

   

our existing market which trades a broad range of products and permits intermediaries to represent unsophisticated customers is subject to the most thorough oversight as a designated contract market the cfma permits us to organize markets that are subject to lesser regulation depending on the types of products traded and the types of traders markets can be organized that trade only products that are unlikely to be susceptible to manipulation and permit direct trading only among institutional participants in order to achieve a less intrusive degree of oversight 

  

the cfma also provides for regulation of derivatives clearing organizations or dcos like our clearing house separately from the exchanges for which they clear contracts and permits dcos to clear a range of otctraded products in addition to products traded on an exchange the cfma requires a dco that clears for a registered futures exchange to register with the cftc however our clearing house was deemed to be registered by reason of its activities prior to enactment of the cfma our clearing house is required to comply with a separate set of flexible core principles that specifically apply to clearing houses a dco may accept for clearing any new contract or may adopt any new rule or rule amendment by providing to the cftc a written certification that the new contract rule or rule amendment complies with the commodity exchange act alternatively the dco may request that the cftc grant prior approval to any contract rule or rule amendment and the cftc must grant approval within 75 days unless the cftc finds that the proposed contract rule or rule amendment would violate the commodity exchange act 

  

demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “selfregulation” that has been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program the cftc is conducting an ongoing review of selfregulatory organizations and the appropriate role if any of self regulation in the futures markets 

  

from time to time it is proposed in congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated including a possible merger between the cftc and the sec while those proposals have not been adopted to date the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely to the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

  

the cftc is subject to reauthorization every four years which is currently scheduled for 2005 we expect proposals to change the regulatory structure to be advanced in connection with the reauthorization process this process could result in regulations that may have a negative impact on the way we operate our exchange including our ability to operate our self regulatory functions or effectively compete with new entrants into our market place 

  

from time to time it is proposed in the president’s budget that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions while those proposals have not been adopted to date except for a percontract fee on single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the imposition of any such tax could increase the cost of using our products and consequently our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

  

our members

certain factors that may affect our business 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 

  

shareholders who own trading rights on our exchange account for 12 of the 20 directors on our board in addition our shareholders who are members and own trading rights on our exchange and who may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members own a substantial amount of our voting stock our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their share ownership and rights to elect directors enables them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

  

we believe that our shareholders who own trading rights on our exchange own a substantial amount of our outstanding class a common stock in addition as of april 21 2004 the date of our most recent annual meeting of shareholders 12 of the 20 directors on our board owned or were officers or directors of others who owned memberships on our exchange we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members this dependence also gives them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

  

many of our trading members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchange in addition trading rights on our exchange have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets our trading members many of whom act as floor brokers and floor traders benefit from trading rules membership privileges and fee discounts that enhance their open outcry trading opportunities and profits our predominantly electronic trading members benefit from fee discounts and transaction fee caps that enhance their electronic trading opportunities and profits our clearing firms benefit from all of the foregoing as well as decisions that increase electronic trading which over time will reduce their costs of doing business on our exchange as a result holders of our class a common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the role they serve in our markets their method of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us represented by class a common stock they may own 

  

the share ownership of our members in combination with their board representation rights and charter provision protections described in the immediately following risk factor could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value 

  

our certificate of incorporation grants special rights to holders of class b common stock which protect their trading rights and give them special board representation and require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant 

  

under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our class b shareholders have the ability to protect their rights to trade on our exchange by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of our markets in particular these provisions include a grant to the holders of our class b common stock of the right to approve any changes to 

  

   

   

   

   

our class b shareholders are also entitled to elect six of the 20 directors on our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small or nonexistent 

  

our certificate of incorporation also includes a provision requiring us to maintain open outcry floor trading on our exchange for a particular traded product as long as the open outcry market is “liquid” our certificate of incorporation requires us to maintain a facility for conducting business disseminating price information clearing and delivery and to provide reasonable financial support for technology marketing and research for open outcry markets our certificate of incorporation provides specific tests as to whether an open outcry market will be deemed liquid as measured on a quarterly basis if a market is deemed illiquid as a result of a failure to meet any of these tests our board will determine whether or not that market will be closed 

  

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions many of which are beyond our control and could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

  

we generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees our clearing and transaction processing services provided to third parties and our quotation data fees we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future each of these revenue sources is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets our trading volume is directly affected by us domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets our operating results and trading volume tend to increase during periods of global and domestic economic and geopolitical uncertainty this is because our customers seek to hedge or manage the risks associated with volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange and commodities markets the future economic environment will be subject to periodic downturns including possible recession and lower volatility in financial markets and may not be as favorable as it has been in recent years as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful trends less favorable than those of recent periods could result in decreased trading volume decreased capital formation and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

  

our cost structure is largely fixed if we are unable to reduce our costs if our revenues decline our profitability will be adversely affected 

  

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability will be adversely affected 

  

the success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic marketplaces that have the functionality performance reliability speed and liquidity required by our customers 

  

the future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance reliability speed and liquidity to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our current overall volume is generated through electronic trading of our cme eurodollar contract and emini sp 500 and emini nasdaq100 products however during 2004 approximately 41 of our volume and nearly 32 of our clearing and transaction fee revenues were generated through our open outcry trading facilities most of our open outcry volume is related to trading in options on our futures contracts our electronic functionality may not be capable of accommodating all of the complex trading strategies typically used for trading options on futures contracts we have implemented a pilot program for an enhanced options system for trading options on cme eurodollars for a limited group of market participants this system is designed to facilitate trading of complex combination and spread trades typically used with shortterm interest rate options on futures within a fully transparent and competitive executive environment in the second half of 2005 we plan to link this system with the cme globex platform to make it accessible to our entire marketplace we also plan to increase its functionality to include trading of other option contracts however we may not complete the development of or successfully implement the required electronic functionality for cme’s options on futures contracts including the integration and operation of our enhanced options system moreover our customers who trade options may not accept our electronic trading systems in either event our ability to increase trading volume of options on futures contracts on the cme globex platform would be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic marketplaces do not have the required functionality performance reliability speed and liquidity we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading 

  

we maintain the simultaneous operation of open outcry trading and electronic trade execution facilities which may over time prove to be inefficient and costly and ultimately adversely affect our profitability 

  

currently we maintain both open outcry trade and electronic trade execution facilities for some products we maintain sidebyside trading facilities for both open outcry and electronic trading we are obligated through the inclusion of provisions in our certificate of incorporation to maintain the operation of our open outcry trading facilities until the trading volumes in them are not significant if we continue to operate both trading facilities for the same product liquidity of markets on each may be less than the liquidity of competing markets on a unified trading platform in addition it may be expensive to continue operating two trading systems for the same product we may incur substantial expenses and experience delays because of our efforts to create trading links between the separate trading platforms to facilitate trading on both systems any loss of efficiency or increase in time to market of new or improved products could be detrimental to our business in addition we may expend resources on the maintenance of our open outcry facilities that could be more efficiently used to develop our capacity and functionality and reduce our costs in the increasingly competitive market for electronic trading facilities 

  

the enhancement of our electronic trading platform exposes us to risks inherent in operating in the new and evolving market for electronic transaction services if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or if our customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

  

we must further enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform or our current or potential customers do not accept it our revenues and profits will be adversely affected 

  

if we are not able to keep up with rapid technological changes our business will be materially harmed 

  

to remain competitive we must continue to improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and other features of our software network distribution systems and technologies the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology changes in customer demand and uses of products and services frequent product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing technology and systems obsolete our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological advancements and changing standards in a timely costefficient and competitive manner we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our technology to customer and competitive requirements or emerging industry standards 

  

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business will not survive 

  

the derivatives securities and financial services industries are highly competitive we expect that competition will continue to intensify in the future our current and prospective competitors both domestically and around the world are numerous they include securities and securities option exchanges futures exchanges otc markets clearing organizations market data and information vendors electronic communications networks crossing systems and similar entities consortia of large customers consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities at december 31 2004 there were 56 futures exchanges located in 29 countries including 9 futures exchanges in the united states in february 2004 eurex commenced operation of its us derivatives exchange eurex us eurex us’s initial competitive efforts were directed at the cbot however eurex us has expanded its product offerings to include futures based on the russell 1000 and russell 2000 indexes in direct competition with us in march 2004 euronextliffe began listing and trading eurodollar futures contracts 

  

we believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies the number of businesses providing internetrelated financial services is rapidly growing other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may become competitive with us through acquisitions changes in federal law allow institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar products to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can in addition our competitors may 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed in addition even if new entrants do not significantly erode our market share we may be required to reduce our fees significantly to remain competitive which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

  

our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to seasonality and a number of other factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance 

  

a number of factors beyond our control may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our operating results—particularly in our quarterly results generally we have experienced relatively higher volume during the first and second quarters and lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters in addition our average rate per contract which impacts our operating results is subject to fluctuation based on the product traded the method of trade and the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade each of these factors is difficult to predict and therefore you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract as a result of seasonality and the factors previously described you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating performance the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

  

the cfma has reduced the barriers of entry into our markets which has led to increased competition and enabled many of our customers to trade futures contracts other than on exchanges these changes may adversely affect our trading volume revenue and profits 

  

our industry has been subject to several fundamental regulatory changes including changes in the statute under which we have operated since 1974 the commodity exchange act generally required all futures contracts to be executed on an exchange that had been approved by the cftc the “exchange trading requirement” was modified by cftc regulations and interpretations to permit privately negotiated swap contracts to be transacted in the otc market the cftc exemption under which the otc derivatives market operated precluded the otc market from using exchangelike electronic transaction systems and clearing facilities these barriers to competition from the otc market were repealed by the cfma one of the chief beneficiaries of the cfma has been otc dealers and competitors that operate or intend to open electronic trading facilities or to conduct their futures business directly among themselves on a bilateral basis the customers who may access these trading facilities or engage in bilateral private transactions are the same customers who account for a substantial portion of our trading volume the cfma also permits banks brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to engage in foreign exchange futures transactions for or with retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act these customers are the same customers who use cme foreign exchange products in the future our industry may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely impact our business including our ability to compete with enterprises who offer offexchange trading and who benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lowercost business model 

  

the cfma also permits bank clearing organizations and clearing organizations regulated by the sec to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that these clearing organizations have traditionally cleared this allocation of jurisdiction may be advantageous to competing clearing organizations and result in a lower volume of trading cleared through our clearing house 

  

our members may seek alternative trading venues and products and negatively impact the liquidity of our markets and our trading volume 

  

the trading activities of our members accounted for nearly 78 of our trading volume during 2004 when we became a forprofit company we changed the role of our members in the operation of our business we eliminated many memberdominated committees or converted them into advisory bodies we gave our professional staff greater decisionmaking responsibilities subject to the oversight of our board of directors our management is charged with making decisions that are designed to enhance shareholder value which may lead to decisions or outcomes with which our members disagree these changes may make us less attractive to our members and encourage them to conduct their business at or seek membership in another exchange or to trade in equivalent products among themselves on a private bilateral basis a material decrease in member trading activity that is not offset by an increase in nonmember trading would negatively impact liquidity and trading volume in our products and reduce our revenues a loss or material reduction in the number of our clearing firms and the capital they provide to guarantee their trades and the trades of their customers would also diminish the strength and attractiveness of our clearing house and our markets 

  

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange 

  

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution alternatives our success also depends on our ability to maintain our trading volume and to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers we also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to lowcost competitors with comparable or superior products services or trade execution facilities if we fail to maintain our trading volume to expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or are unable to attract new customers our business will be adversely affected 

  

any significant decline in the trading volume of our cme eurodollar sp 500 or nasdaq100 futures and options on futures contracts or in privately negotiated foreign exchange transactions using our clearing house would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

  

we are substantially dependent on trading volume from four product offerings for a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits the clearing and transaction fee revenues attributable to transactions in cme eurodollar contracts all our contracts based on the sp 500 and nasdaq100 including cme emini products and privately negotiated foreign exchange transactions using our clearing house were approximately 43 26 10 and 6 respectively of our total clearing and transaction fee revenues during 2004 and 36 35 12 and 8 respectively during 2003 any significant decline in our trading volume in any of these products would negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results 

  

we believe our cme eurodollar contract serves as a global financial benchmark but we cannot assure you that in the future other products will not become preferred alternatives to our cme eurodollar contract as a means of managing or speculating on interest rate risk we also cannot assure you that competitors will not enter the eurodollar market for example in march 2004 euronextliffe began listing and trading eurodollar futures contracts our members may also elect to trade eurodollars in privately negotiated bilateral transactions without the use of our clearing house in either of these events our trading volume revenues and profitability could be adversely affected in addition exchange traded funds or etfs compete with our equity index products and are increasing in popularity etfs represent a basket of securities that are traded on an exchange 

  

our rights to the standard  poor’s ® and nasdaq ® products were obtained through licensing arrangements our license agreement with standard  poor’s provides that the sp 500 index futures products will be exclusive until december 31 2008 and nonexclusive from december 31 2008 until december 31 2013 

  

in october 2003 we extended and expanded our license agreement with the nasdaq stock market inc to license both the nasdaq100 index and the nasdaq composite index to us for trading futures and options on futures contracts that are based on the indexes our license with nasdaq is exclusive with respect to futures and options on futures contracts based on the nasdaq100 index through october 9 2007 with an automatic renewal until october 9 2011 

  

we cannot assure you that either of our standard  poor’s or nasdaq license agreements will be renewed when they terminate in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use alternative instruments including securities and options based on the sp and nasdaq indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond the jurisdictional reach of us andor our licensors we also cannot assure you that nasdaq will not directly or indirectly through other exchanges offer security futures contracts that compete with our broadbased index futures contracts based upon nasdaq indexes 

  

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties our financial condition will be adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

  

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our exchange or on thirdparty exchanges for which we provide clearing and transaction processing services as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including our clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons a substantial part of our working capital is at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

  

we may not continue to realize the benefits of our agreement to provide clearing and transaction processing services for cbot products 

  

we entered into an agreement with the cbot in april 2003 which was subsequently amended in march 2004 to provide clearing and transaction processing services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts under the terms of the agreement clearing services for commodity equity index and some interest rate products began in november 2003 and for all other cbot futures and options on futures contracts on january 2 2004 in 2004 we cleared 600 million contracts for the cbot which generated approximately 55 million in clearing and transaction processing services revenue we cannot assure you that we will continue to realize the benefits received from our clearing and transaction processing agreement our future revenues from providing these clearing and transaction processing services will be dependent on the cbot’s ability to maintain andor expand its trading volume which is subject to a number of factors beyond its control as a futures exchange cbot’s ability to maintain or expand its volume and operate its business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject for example in february 2004 eurex launched a registered us derivatives exchange eurex us which offers among other products contracts on us treasury notes and bonds in direct competition with contracts currently traded at cbot any significant decrease in cbot’s trading volume will result in a corresponding decrease in our realized benefits our net income from the clearing and transaction processing services we provide to the cbot will also depend on our ability to control our costs associated with providing such services 

  

the initial term of the agreement is five years with subsequent three year renewals upon the mutual consent of the parties the terms of the agreement also provide that both we and the cbot may terminate the agreement in some circumstances we cannot assure you that the agreement will not be terminated prior to the end of its term or that the agreement will be renewed after its initial term any such event could have an adverse effect on our revenues 

  

our market data fees may be reduced or eliminated by the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems if we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we will experience a reduction in revenue 

  

we sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions revenues from our market data totaled 609 million or 8 of our net revenues during 2004 and 532 million or 10 of our net revenues for the same period in 2003 electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate charges for supplying market data to trading terminals if we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available we could lose quote fee revenue from those who have access to trading terminals we will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost quote fee revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees 

  

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

  

we are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar events if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure employee or customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

  

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled in september 2002 and may 2003 we experienced hardware failures that resulted in a temporary suspension of trading on the cme globex platform the impact of these events has not been material however we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not be material 

  

our status as a cftc registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance increased cme globex trading volume may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations file lawsuits against us or cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

  

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy our goal is to design our systems to handle at least twice our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products as volumes grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate increased volume and to provide clearing and transaction processing services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

  

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchange even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit or stop the use of our markets 

  

some of our largest clearing firms which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with the futures industry association have sought and may seek in the future legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution clearing and settlement business if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish or seek to use alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchange even if they are not successful in their efforts the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets if any of these events occur our revenues and profits would be adversely affected 

  

we depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption in or the cessation of an important supply or service by any third party and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all would result in lost revenue and higher costs 

  

our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities we could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems 

  

we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations our networks and those of our third party service providers our members and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities 

  

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

  

although the cfma significantly reduced our regulatory burdens we remain extensively regulated by the cftc our international operations may be subject to similar regulations in specific jurisdictions we are registered in the united kingdom australia austria france hong kong italy japan the netherlands singapore and switzerland in some cases our registrations are subject to annual review and such reviews may subject us to additional requirements in the future we may also be required to register or become subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in order to accept business from customers in those jurisdictions 

  

many aspects of our operations are subject to oversight and regulation by the cftc our activities relating to single stock and narrowbased stock index futures products are also subject to oversight by the sec our operations are subject to ongoing review and oversight including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization changes in laws regulations or governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on the way we conduct our business 

  

the cftc has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with its rules and regulations we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations we also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the cftc or other agencies 

  

demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “selfregulation” that has been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program the cftc is conducting an ongoing review of selfregulatory organizations and the appropriate role if any of self regulation in the futures markets we cannot assure you that the cftc will not make modifications to its regulations as a result of its review any such modification or restructuring of our regulatory functions could entail material costs and may have an adverse effect on the way we conduct our business 

  

from time to time it is proposed in congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated including a possible merger between the cftc and the sec while those proposals have not been adopted to date the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely to the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us our business could be negatively affected 

  

the cftc is subject to reauthorization every four years which is currently scheduled for 2005 we expect proposals to change the regulatory structure to be advanced in connection with the reauthorization process this process could result in regulations that may have a negative impact on the way we operate our exchange including our ability to operate our selfregulatory functions or effectively compete with new entrants into our market place 

  

from time to time the president’s budget includes a proposal that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions while those proposals have not been adopted to date except for a percontract fee imposed under the securities exchange act of 1934 on single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits 

  

our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

  

generally the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which can be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

  

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational legal and regulatory risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

  

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability 

  

many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks while we enjoy governmental immunity for some of our marketrelated activities we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as the result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we could be harmed by employee misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

  

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees including employees of gfx corporation our wholly owned subsidiary that engages in proprietary trading primarily in foreign exchange futures could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of cme customers or improper use of confidential information employee misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence or otherwise as well as regulatory actions for example employees of gfx corporation enter into transactions to promote liquidity in cme foreign exchange contracts on the cme globex platform and subsequently enter into offsetting transactions using futures contracts or spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market to limit market risk in the event the offsetting transaction is not entered into or is not timely or properly executed we could be exposed to substantial market risk 

  

we may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively 

  

we have experienced significant growth in our business continued growth may require additional investment in personnel facilities information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources we may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described in the following risk factor through acquisitions or other strategic alliances unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth our future profitability could be adversely affected and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth 

  

our acquisition investment and alliance strategy involves risks if we are unable to effectively manage these risks our business will be materially harmed 

  

to achieve our strategic objectives in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies businesses or technologies acquisitions entail numerous risks including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we may not be able to integrate successfully any operations personnel services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future 

  

we also may seek to expand or enhance some of our operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest and potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners for example in 2001 we entered into an operating agreement governing onechicago our joint venture with the cboe and the cbot to trade single stock futures and futures based on narrowbased stock indexes we own approximately a 40 interest in the joint venture onechicago’s performance to date has been poor and the company has not met our expectations we continue to monitor its performance and future prospects and evaluate whether or not we will make additional investments in onechicago our ability to control strategic decisions by onechicago or its board is limited in addition under the terms of our amended operating agreement until june 30 2005 we are restricted from in any way engaging in the business of trading marketing regulating selling purchasing clearing or settling transactions in single stock futures other than in conjunction with the joint venture this restriction on our ability to compete applies whether or not we remain part of the joint venture but it does not apply to futures based on exchangetraded funds or narrowbased stock indexes we cannot assure you that any joint venture or alliance that we have entered into including onechicago or may enter into in the future will be successful 

  

our ability to successfully trade single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes may be impaired by statutory and regulatory provisions that limit our natural competitive advantages and expand opportunities for competitors 

  

the cfma which authorized us to trade futures contracts based on individual securities and narrowbased stock indexes or security futures prohibited the implementation in connection with these contracts of many traditional features of futures trading that would have made using security futures cheaper tax advantaged and more efficient than using similar security options and otc security derivatives the cfma also created a system of dual registration and regulation for security futures intermediaries and exchanges that may be costly and burdensome to the intermediaries and the exchanges and may discourage intermediaries and investors from using security futures the cfma also eliminated most legal impediments to unregulated trading of security futures or similar products between qualified investors in addition foreign exchanges may be allowed to trade similar products under terms that will be more favorable than the terms we are permitted to offer our customers finally security futures are subject to a number of complicated and controversial regulations as a result we cannot assure you that we either directly or through our joint venture onechicago will be successful in offering single stock futures or futures on narrowbased stock indexes 

  

the imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at or otherwise offset by a fungible position existing at another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business 

  

in connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the cfma contemplates that clearing houses will after an initial period establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house if in the future a similar requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 

  

expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we plan to continue to expand our operations internationally including by directly placing order entry terminals with members andor nonmember customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition we will be required to comply with the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities of each country in which we conduct business these may include laws rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business to date we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets we may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

  

we rely primarily on trade secret copyright service mark trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights we have filed several patent applications covering our technology in the united states and certain other jurisdictions notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights we also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law we have copyright registrations for certain of our software user manuals and databases the copyright protection afforded to databases however is fairly limited while the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable the actual data may not be and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function in some cases including a number of our most important products there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

  

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing our products and electronic execution services 

  

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications these claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry 

  

in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

  

we only recently began operating as a forprofit company and have a limited operating history as a forprofit company accordingly our historical and recent financial and business results may not be representative of what they may be in the future 

  

we have only operated as a forprofit company with private ownership interests since november 2000 we have a limited operating history as a forprofit business on which you can evaluate our management decisions business strategy and financial results as a result our historical and recent financial and business results may not be representative of what they may be in the future we are subject to risks uncertainties expenses and difficulties associated with changing and implementing our business strategy that are not typically encountered by established forprofit companies the major us futures exchanges have operated historically as mutual membership organizations there is little history or experience in operating an exchange as a forprofit corporation upon which we can draw as a notforprofit company our business strategy and fee structure were designed to provide profit opportunities for our members we targeted profit levels that provided sufficient levels of working capital today our forprofit initiatives are designed to increase our revenues make us profitable optimize volume and liquidity and create operating efficiencies these initiatives may not yield the benefits or efficiencies we expect for example fee increases volume and member discounts and new access rules to our markets may not separately result in higher revenues and profits or greater volume or liquidity in our markets as a result we may not be able to operate effectively as a forprofit corporation it is possible that we may incur significant operating losses in the future and that we may not be able to achieve or sustain longterm profitability 

  

as a holding company we are dependent on dividends from our operating subsidiary to pay dividends and other obligations 

  

we are a holding company with no business operations our most significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiary as a result we rely on payments from our subsidiary to meet our obligations under our dividend policy our dividend target is approximately 30 of the prior year’s cash earnings in 2004 we paid regular quarterly dividends of 026 per share to our class a and class b shareholders on january 31 2005 we declared a first quarter dividend of 046 per share payable on march 28 2005 although in the past our subsidiary has generated sufficient cash flow to pay dividends to us to allow us to pay a dividend in respect of our class a and class b common stock we cannot guarantee you that it will continue to have adequate cash flow to do so in the future our existing credit facility as well as future credit facilities other future debt obligations and statutory provisions may limit our ability to pay dividends 

  










 item 2 properties 

  

our trading facilities and corporate headquarters are located at 20 south wacker drive in chicago illinois we occupy approximately 496000 square feet of office space pursuant to a lease that expires in 2008 we also occupy approximately 70000 square feet of trading floor space under a lease with the cme trust with an initial term that expires in 2009 we have an option to extend the term of the lease to 2012 with an option for two successive sevenyear extensions through 2019 and 2026 we maintain backup facilities for our electronic systems in separate office towers at 10 and 30 south wacker drive and we opened a remote data center that became operational in the third quarter of 2002 and added a second remote data center in 2004 that will become operational in 2005 we also lease administrative office space in washington dc and tokyo japan and both administrative and communication equipment space in london england we believe our facilities are adequate for our current operations and that additional space can be obtained if needed 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we are not a party to or to our knowledge threatened with any litigation or other legal proceeding that in our opinion could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition

general 

  

we are the largest futures exchange in the united states for the trading of futures and options on futures as measured by 2003 annual trading volume in 2003 our customers which include our members traded futures and options on futures contracts with a notional dollar value of 3337 trillion making us the world’s largest exchange by this measure we also have the largest futures and options on futures open interest of any exchange in the world as of december 31 2003 our open interest record was 354 million contracts set on december 11 2003 not including the 28 million contracts that we managed for cbot on that day open interest is a widely recognized indicator of the level of customer interest in an exchange’s products 

  

we bring together buyers and sellers of derivatives products on our open outcry trading floors on the globex electronic trading platform and through privately negotiated transactions that we clear we offer market participants the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on interest rates equity foreign exchange and commodities our key products include eurodollar contracts and contracts based on major us stock indexes including the sp 500 and the nasdaq100 we also offer contracts for the principal foreign currencies and for a number of commodity products including cattle hogs and dairy we believe several of our key products serve as global financial benchmarks our eurodollar contract provides a benchmark for measuring the relative value of us dollardenominated shortterm fixedincome securities similarly our sp 500 index and nasdaq100 index contracts are closely linked to the benchmark indexes for us equity performance 

  

our products provide a means for hedging speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with interest rate sensitive instruments equity ownership changes in the value of foreign currency and changes in the prices of commodity products our customer base includes professional traders financial institutions institutional and individual investors major corporations manufacturers producers supranational entities and governments 

  

we own our clearing house which is the largest derivatives clearing entity in the world and guarantee clear and settle every contract traded through our exchange during 2003 we processed an average of approximately 531000 trade transactions per day we currently have the capacity to clear more than 25 million transactions per day our systems are scalable and give us the ability to increase our capacity with little lead time as of december 31 2003 we acted as custodian for approximately 370 billion in collateral in 2003 we moved an average of 14 billion of settlement funds through our clearing system each day in addition 46 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide have adopted our span risk evaluation system which is used to determine the appropriate performance bond requirements for trading portfolios nymex and clearnetlch also use clearing 21 our stateoftheart clearing system jointly developed with nymex we however do not generate material revenue from the adoption of these systems by other exchanges 

  

we have a history of innovation in our industry in the 1960s we introduced the first livestock futures contract that resulted in the physical delivery of live cattle in 1972 we introduced the world’s first financial futures contracts when we launched seven foreign exchange futures contracts that innovation fundamentally changed the nature and scope of futures markets transforming them from agricultural hedging mechanisms to hedging and risk management markets for financial instruments and financial risks we also developed the first cashsettled futures in 1981 with the introduction of eurodollar futures which is one of the world’s most actively traded futures contract cash settlement also enabled us to introduce in 1982 the first successful stock index futures contract the sp 500 futures in 1987 we pioneered the concept of global electronic trading of derivatives contracts and we subsequently launched the globex platform in 1992 today most of our products trade electronically in addition to on our open outcry trading floors in 1997 we introduced the first of our emini stock index products which are smallersized electronically traded versions of our successful benchmark stock index futures contracts in april 2003 we entered into an agreement with the chicago board of trade or cbot for us to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts 

  

cme was founded in 1898 as a notforprofit corporation in november 2000 we became the first us financial exchange to demutualize and become a shareholderowned corporation as a consequence we have adopted a forprofit approach to our business including strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing volume efficiency and liquidity we posted record trading volume of 6402 million contracts in 2003 an increase of 146 over 2002 which was previously our busiest year 

  

we devote substantial resources to introducing new products based on new markets or securities for example in 2001 we formed onechicago llc our joint venture with chicago board options exchange or cboe and cbot to trade single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes onechicago commenced its trading operations in november 2002 in 2003 we added three additional trakrs products which are private label index products developed with merrill lynch  co inc trakrs which stands for total return asset contracts are a series of nontraditional futures contracts licensed exclusively for us for north america and are the first broadbased index products traded on a us futures exchange that can be sold by securities brokers in addition in 2003 we announced plans to list electronically traded futures contracts on the us consumer price index or cpi these new contracts began trading on february 8 2004 in 2003 we also began listing weather products on five european cities and expanded the number of us cities covered by our weather products from five to 15 

  

throughout our history our members have conducted their trading through our open outcry trading facilities the roots of our open outcry trading began in the late 1800s when our predecessor the chicago butter and egg board established official quotations in butter eggs poultry and other farm products membership gave the right to participate in the markets in what was to become open outcry trading and was expanded over the decades to accommodate new traders in new commodities and financial products for the year ended december 31 2003 open outcry represented approximately 54 of our trading volume 

  

trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by our members our members are individual traders as well as most of the world’s largest banks brokerages and investment houses prior to the introduction of our electronic trading platform our members traded only on our open outcry trading floors today our members are able to conduct trading on our open outcry trading floors electronically through the globex platform and through privately negotiated transactions that we clear members who broker trades executed on our open outcry trading floors generally do not play a role in facilitating the execution of transactions on behalf of customers on globex 

  

prior to our demutualization direct access to our markets whether on our open outcry trading floors or through the globex platform was limited to members and those with an exchange permit who met specified qualifications in connection with our demutualization we opened access to our markets by allowing unlimited direct access to the globex platform for all market participants today any individual or institutional customer guaranteed by a clearing firm is able to obtain direct access to the globex platform we have further opened access to our markets by expanding the range of member and nonmember customer choices for alternative execution procedures such as block trading and privately negotiated exchangeforphysical or efp transactions while our members benefit from market information advantages that may accrue from their proximity to activity on the trading floors as a result of the increased access to our markets all market participants now have the ability to view bids and offers in the market generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers in 2003 our members were responsible for nearly 80 of our total trading volume 

  

as a result of our conversion into a forprofit corporation in the fall of 2000 individuals and entities who at the time were members and owned trading rights on our exchange became the owners of all our outstanding equity these individuals and entities continued to own substantially all of our outstanding equity following our reorganization into a holding company structure in december 2001 and our initial public offering in december 2002 as of december 31 2003 owners of trading rights on our exchange owned of record approximately 69 of our class a common stock 

  

our principal executive offices are located at 20 south wacker drive chicago illinois 60606 and our telephone number is 3129301000 

  

competitive strengths 

  

we have established ourselves as a premier global marketplace for financial risk management we believe our principal competitive strengths are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

highly liquid markets the liquidity in our markets is a key factor in attracting and retaining customers we have the largest open interest of any exchange in the world of futures and options on futures contracts as of december 31 2003 our open interest record was 354 million contracts set on december 11 2003 not including the 28 million contracts that we managed for cbot on that day before 2003 our open interest record was 248 million contacts set in 2002 during 2003 we posted record trading volume of 6402 million contracts an increase of 146 over 2002 making us the most active exchange in the united states and the second most active in the world for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts during that period by notional value we are the largest futures exchange in the world with 3337 trillion traded in 2003 our deep and liquid markets tend to attract additional customers which in turn further enhance our liquidity 

  

global benchmark products we believe our key products serve as global benchmarks for valuing and managing risk our eurodollar contract serves as a global benchmark for measuring the relative value of us dollardenominated shortterm fixedincome securities similarly the sp 500 and nasdaq100 indexes are considered primary tools for benchmarking investment performance against us equity market exposure our sp 500 index and nasdaq100 index contracts which are based on these benchmarks are recognized by our customers as efficient tools for managing and hedging their equity market risks 

  

diverse portfolio of products and services we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing and offering to our customers a diverse array of products as well as a broad range of trade execution and clearing services we have a long history of developing innovative interest rate equity foreign exchange and commodity products designed to appeal to institutional and individual customers we offer both open outcry auction trading and electronic ordermatching services and we provide facilities to clear privately negotiated transactions our markets provide important risk management tools to our customers which include leading global and financial institutions we work closely with our customers to create markets and products that meet their needs these relationships help us to anticipate and lead industry changes 

  

wholly owned clearing house we own our clearing house which guarantees clears and settles every contract traded through our exchange and futures and options on futures contracts traded through cbot during 2003 we processed an average of approximately 531000 trade transactions per day we currently have the capacity to clear more than 25 million transactions per day and our scalable systems give us the ability to further increase our capacity with little lead time in april 2003 we entered into an agreement with cbot for us to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts pursuant to this agreement we began providing clearing services on november 24 2003 for some cbot products and as of january 2 2004 we began clearing all of cbot’s products as of december 31 2003 we acted as custodian for approximately 370 billion in performance bond collateral and in 2003 moved an average of 14 billion of settlement funds through our clearing system each day we believe our performance guarantee is a major attraction of our markets particularly compared to the overthecounter or otc markets because it substantially reduces counterparty risk our clearing system permits more efficient use of capital for our customers by allowing netting of long and short positions in a single type of contract and providing risk offset and crossmargining arrangements with several other leading clearing houses in addition ownership of our clearing house enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development technology market regulation and other risk management activities our current capacity ensures that we are able to service peak volumes provide clearing services to cbot introduce new products with high volume potential and provide clearing services to other exchanges in the future 

  

proven and scalable technology we believe our ability to use technology effectively has been a key factor in the successful development of our business as a result of significant investments in our technology asset base we possess fast reliable and fully integrated trading and clearing systems our highly scalable systems are designed to accommodate additional products with relatively limited modifications and low incremental costs the core components of our system infrastructure for trading clearing and risk management are becoming widely adopted throughout the futures industry resulting in common interfaces and efficiencies for intermediaries and customers for example our span risk evaluation system has been adopted by 46 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide in addition clearing 21 our stateoftheart clearing system jointly developed with nymex is being used by nymex and clearnetlch 

  

global reach globalization of financial markets is expanding the customer base for futures products beyond traditional boundaries our electronic trading services which are available more than 23 hours a day and five days per week position us to take advantage of this development we have established strategic relationships with other exchanges and clearing houses around the world to enable our customers to gain further capital and execution efficiencies these relationships are intended to extend the market reach of our global derivatives business we received 71 million in clearing and transaction fees from our strategic relationships during the year ended december 31 2003 to further our global strategy in early 2002 we installed a local telecommunications hub in london we plan to further expand our global reach by installing similar hubs in amsterdam dublin frankfort gibraltar milan and paris in 2004 these hubs will further reduce connectivity costs and will house direct electronic connections between europe and our globex electronic trading platform as part of our strategy in november 2003 we also introduced a pricing incentive program that significantly reduces the total transaction fees on all globex products for proprietary trading groups and trading arcades located in europe additionally in september 2003 we entered into an agreement with bloomberg lp to expand the global distribution of our electronically traded contracts by allowing all bloomberg terminals worldwide access to our products on globex 

  

growth strategy 

  

globalization deregulation and advances in technology offer significant opportunities for expanding futures markets and exchange markets generally we intend to increase our trading volumes revenues and profitability by capitalizing on these opportunities through implementation of the following four strategies 

  

   

   

   

   

expand our current core business we intend to advance our position as a leader in the futures industry by expanding customer access to our markets and services offering additional trade execution choices and enhancing our market data and information products 

  

   

   

   

add new products we develop new products and product line extensions based on research and development in collaboration with our customers and financial services firms we have created modified versions of some of our existing products in order to attract new types of customers for example in 1997 and 1999 respectively we introduced emini versions of our larger open outcrytraded sp 500 and nasdaq100 futures contracts by creating smallersized products and offering electronic trading services in them we have successfully expanded our customer base and overall volume we introduced emini russell 2000 futures contracts in october 2001 and in january 2002 we initiated trading in emini sp midcap 400 futures contracts another smaller scale version of one of our larger contracts that offers exposure to small and mediumsized capitalization company stocks we also seek to introduce new contracts that complement our existing product line in april 2003 we launched russell 1000 futures contracts in combination with our other products the new contract offers exposure to the russell 3000 universe of stocks representing 98 of the investable us equity market based on total market capitalization in october 2003 we launched our emini nasdaq composite index which we believe is a broad well diversified realtime representation of the performance of nasdaqlisted companies 

  

in july 2002 we launched trakrs trakrs are designed to enable customers to track an index of stocks bonds currencies or other financial instruments longshort technology trakrs were the first in this new product line we subsequently introduced in 2002 select 50 trakrs contracts and lmc trakrs which identify value and growth stocks of lower market capitalization companies in 2003 commodity trakrs euro currency trakrs and gold trakrs were launched trakrs differ from traditional futures contracts in that most noninstitutional customers who purchase these contracts are required to post 100 of the trakrs market value at the time of the purchase as a result these customers will not be subject to margin calls or any requirement to make any additional payments throughout the life of their trakrs positions 

  

in september 2002 we began to introduce futures contracts based on industry sectors within the sp 500 index we also intend to continue expanding our derivatives product lines by introducing contracts based on new markets or securities such as single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes onechicago our joint venture with cboe and cbot initiated trading of 21 single stock futures on november 8 2002 and as of december 31 2003 listed 107 single stock narrowbased index and exchangetraded fund futures in addition we intend to continue working with emerging cash market trading platforms to jointly develop innovative futures products 

  

in march 2003 we launched futures and options on futures based on a new dollar index the cmeindex a geometric index of seven foreign currencies that is weighted to reflect the relative competitiveness of us goods in foreign markets the cmeindex provides investors with a new instrument for euro currency speculation and risk management the seven currencies included in the cmeindex index are the european union euro japanese yen british pound swiss franc australian dollar canadian dollar and swedish krona 

  

on february 8 2004 we launched new electronically traded futures contracts on the cpi these new cpi contracts are the first product we have listed on a major economic indicator 

  

provide transaction processing services and other business services to third parties we intend to leverage our existing capacity scalable technology and business processes to provide a broad range of services to other exchanges clearing organizations and emarketplaces we intend to offer services including clearing and settlement processing and risk management market structuring product structuring and trade execution platforms we believe we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering some or all of these services on a costeffective basis in combination with the potential to access our broad distribution customer base and experienced liquidity providers users of our clearing services also have the potential to gain substantial capital and collateral efficiencies for their clearing firms for example in april 2003 we entered into an agreement with cbot for us to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts pursuant to this agreement we began providing clearing services for cbot on november 24 2003 and as of january 2 2004 we began clearing all of cbot’s products the arrangement provides clearing firms and customers with the potential to gain operational performance bond and capital efficiencies as well as a combined risk capital pool and other expected cost savings as a result of our agreement with cbot our clearing house is the largest derivatives clearing organization for futures and options on futures in the world we cleared 95 million contracts for cbot in 2003 open interest for cbot contracts cleared by us was 27 million contracts at december 31 2003 

  

pursue select alliances and acquisitions we plan to supplement our internal growth through the formation of joint ventures or alliances and select acquisitions of businesses or technologies we will seek alliances and acquisitions that help us to enter new markets provide services that we currently do not offer open access to our markets or advance our technology for example in november 2003 we extended our mutual offset agreement or mos agreement with the singapore derivatives exchange ltd and added the yenbased nikkei 225 futures contract to the agreement in january 2004 we also acquired the technologyrelated assets and intellectual property of liquidity direct in january 2004 to facilitate the trading of our options on futures contracts in 2002 we entered into an agreement with nymex to introduce smallersized versions of key nymex energy futures contracts for trading on our globex electronic trading platform the products based on our successful emini stock index contracts are called eminy energy futures and clear at the nymex clearing house on june 17 2002 eminy crude oil and natural gas futures contracts began trading 

  

products 

  

our broad range of products includes futures contracts and options on futures contracts based on interest rates equity foreign exchange and commodities our products are traded through our open outcry auction markets through the globex electronic trading platform or in privately negotiated transactions that we clear for the year ended december 31 2003 we derived 4306 million or 800 of our net revenues from fees associated with trading and clearing products on or through our exchange these fees include per contract charges for trade execution clearing and globex fees fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded the method of trade and the exchange trading privileges of the customer making the trade generally members are charged lower fees than nonmembers certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to encourage increased liquidity in our markets our markets also generate valuable data and information regarding pricing and trading activity in our products revenues from market data products totaled 532 million or 99 of our net revenues in 2003 

  

we identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers historically we have successfully introduced a variety of new futures products we pioneered the trading of foreign exchange futures in 1972 and eurodollar futures the first cashsettled futures contracts listed for trading in 1981 in 1982 we were the first to introduce a successful stock index futures contract the sp 500 index futures contract and in 1996 we introduced the nasdaq100 index futures contract we believe the sp 500 index and the nasdaq100 index are the global benchmarks for managing exposure to the us stock markets and our futures contracts based on them are among the most successful products in our industry the smaller electronically traded versions of these contracts the emini sp 500 index futures and the emini nasdaq100 index futures were introduced in 1997 and 1999 respectively 

  

the following table shows the total notional value and average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product groups for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

   

interest rate products our interest rate products include our global benchmark eurodollar futures contracts eurodollars are us dollar bank deposits outside the united states eurodollar futures contracts are shortterm interest rate products and constitute one of the most successful products in our industry and one of the most actively traded futures contracts in the world open interest on eurodollar futures and options on futures contracts traded on our exchange was approximately 137 million contracts on december 31 2003 representing a notional value of approximately 316 trillion we also trade contracts based on other shortterm interest rates such as onemonth libor which stands for the london interbank offered rate and euroyen interest rate products represented 486 of our trading volume during 2003 an average of approximately 12 million contracts per day 

  

the growth of our eurodollar futures market has been driven by the general acceptance of the us dollar as the principal reserve currency for financial institutions throughout the world as a result eurodollar deposits have significance in the international capital markets participants in our eurodollar futures market are generally major domestic and international banks and other financial institutions that face interest rate risks from their lending and borrowing activities their activities as dealers in otc interest rate swaps and structured derivatives products and their proprietary trading activities many of these participants use our eurodollar and other interest rate contracts to hedge or arbitrage their money market swaps or convert their interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a floating rate or a floating rate to a fixed rate asset managers also use our interest rate products to lengthen the effective maturity of shortterm investment assets by buying futures contracts or shorten the effective maturity by selling futures our contracts are an attractive alternative when physical restructuring of a portfolio is not possible or when futures transaction costs are lower than the cash market transaction costs in 1999 we initiated simultaneous sidebyside electronic trading in our eurodollar contracts trading in our eurodollar contracts often involves complex trading strategies that we believe cannot be fully accommodated by existing electronic trading platforms accordingly electronic trading in our eurodollar contracts initially achieved only limited market acceptance we continue to develop and implement new electronic functionality to accommodate trading strategies required for electronic trading of eurodollar contracts in 2003 we launched our eagle project which enables customers to execute trades electronically in the first eight quarterly expirations and 22 corresponding calendar spreads in eurodollar futures the introduction of this enhanced functionality contributed to a 45 increase in electronic trading of our eurodollar futures contracts during 2003 this technology closely replicates eurodollar trading conventions employed in open outcry and is designed to help maintain our leadership in eurodollar futures in january 2004 to further provide market users with innovative technology solutions to support their electronic trading needs we acquired the technologyrelated assets and intellectual property of liquidity direct to incorporate its options and spread trading technology into our globex electronic trading platform liquidity direct has developed an innovative patentpending technology to effectively facilitate trading of the complex combinations and spreads typically used with options products in a fully transparent and competitive execution environment we intend to introduce more functionality that will accommodate other complex trading strategies electronically 

  

our interest rate product trading volume grew significantly from 1998 to 2002 the increase was due primarily to the volatility of shortterm interest rates monetary policy of the us federal reserve board and a decline in the issuance of us treasury securities with less availability of us treasury securities swap dealers who represent a significant group of our customers turned to our eurodollar contract as a benchmark for valuing fixedincome obligations and as a tool for managing dollardenominated interest rate exposure in 2003 we experienced modest growth of our interest rate product trading volume with total 2003 trading volume up 06 over 2002 

  

we intend to increase our revenues from our interest rate product sector by optimizing pricing of existing products and introducing new products to increase our trading volume we have been active in adopting new policies and practices that are closely aligned with customer demand and designed to promote enhanced market penetration 

  

equity products we have been a leader in stock index futures since we began offering these products in 1982 and remain the largest exchange in the world for trading stock index futures stock index futures products permit investors to obtain exposure for hedging or speculative purposes to a change in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities we offer trading in futures contracts based upon the sp 500 index and nasdaq100 index other small medium and largecapitalization domestic indexes and indexes on foreign equity markets as of december 31 2003 our market share in all us listed stock index futures was approximately 95 based on the number of contracts traded 

  

our total trading volume for stock index products rose 316 in 2003 to 2862 million contracts from 2175 million contracts in 2002 trading in stock index futures products represented 447 of our total trading volume during 2003 an average of more than 11 million contracts per day in 2003 904 of our stock index product trading volume was based on the sp 500 index and the nasdaq100 index the total notional value of sp 500 futures and options on futures contracts traded on our exchange was approximately 138 trillion during 2003 compared to the approximately 94 trillion value of stock traded on the new york stock exchange in addition the notional value of our stock index futures contracts is significantly larger than the comparable exchangetraded fund which is a basket of securities designed to track an index but trades on a securities exchange or electronic communications network like a single stock in 2003 the total notional value of our sp 500 futures contracts was more than 126 trillion compared with approximately 10 trillion for sp 500 depositary receipts in 2003 the total notional value of our nasdaq100 futures contracts was approximately 22 trillion compared to approximately 06 trillion for the qqqs which is the nasdaq100 index tracking stock 

  

standard  poor’s corporation designed and maintains the sp 500 index to be a proxy for a diversified equity portfolio representing a broad crosssection of the us equity markets the index is based on the stock prices of 500 largecapitalization companies we have an exclusive license with standard  poor’s until 2008 the nasdaq100 index is based on the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks listed on the nasdaq national market we have a license with nasdaq that allows us to offer the nasdaq100 index and nasdaq composite contracts exclusively until october 2011 for a more detailed discussion of these license agreements see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—licensing agreements” our standard sp and nasdaq products are traded through our open outcry facilities during regular trading hours and on globex after the close of open outcry trading 

  

we also offer futures and in some cases options on futures contracts on the sp midcap 400 the sp smallcap 600 the spbarra growth and value indexes which are based on data compiled by sp and barra inc the nikkei stock average the sptopix 150 the russell 1000 stock price index the russell 2000 stock price index and the goldman sachs commodity index in july 2002 we launched trakrs a private label index product developed with merrill lynch  co inc trakrs are a series of nontraditional futures contracts licensed exclusively to us for north america and are the first broadbased index products traded on a us futures exchange that can be sold by securities brokers 

  

trakrs are designed to enable customers to track an index of stocks bonds currencies or other financial instruments longshort technology trakrs were the first in this product line we subsequently introduced select 50 trakrs and lmc trakrs in 2002 trading in commodity trakrs commenced in july 2003 eurocurrency trakrs began trading in august 2003 and gold trakrs in december 2003 we also launched our second round of our longshort technology trakrs in january 2004 trakrs differ from traditional futures contracts in that most noninstitutional customers who purchase these contracts are required to post 100 of the trakrs market value at the time of purchase as a result these customers will not be subject to margin calls or any requirement to make any additional payments throughout the life of their trakrs positions in september 2002 we introduced spctr futures contracts based on subsets of the sp 500 index technology and financial each contract is sized at 125 times the respective index price making the contract size comparable to the emini stock index contracts 

  

we believe the variety of our stock index futures products appeals to a broad group of equity investors these investors include public and private pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets 

  

in 1997 we launched our emini sp 500 futures contracts we followed this highly successful new product offering with the introduction of emini nasdaq100 futures contracts in 1999 emini contracts are traded exclusively on our electronic globex platform and are onefifth the size of their standard counterparts these products are designed to address the growing demand for stock index derivatives and electronically traded products from individual traders and small institutions trading volumes in these products have grown rapidly  achieving new volume and open interest records on a regular basis during 2002 and 2003 this growth is attributable to the benefits of stock index futures electronic market access and prior to 2003 significant volatility in the us equity markets in october 2001 we also introduced emini russell 2000 index futures in january 2002 we introduced an emini version of our sp midcap 400 futures contract in october 2003 we launched our emini futures contracts on the nasdaq composite index this contract provides a product that tracks the entire nasdaq stock market in contrast to the nasdaq100 index which includes only the top 100 nonfinancial stocks listed on the nasdaq stock market 

  

we believe our leading market position in equity products is a result of the liquidity of our markets the status of the sp 500 index and the nasdaq100 index as two of the principal us financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns and the appeal to investors and traders of our emini products and globex we believe future growth in our stock index products will come from expanding customer access to our electronic markets as well as further educating the marketplace on the benefits of these products 

  

other equity product growth opportunities are expected to come from the introduction of single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes industry deregulation permits futures and securities exchanges to offer single stock futures and futures contracts on narrowbased stock indexes single stock futures allow investors to obtain exposure for hedging or speculative purposes that is economically equivalent to owning or shorting an individual stock without actually buying or selling the stock they are designed to offer leverage ease of trading and less expensive more customized risk management strategies than equity options equity swaps and stock lending transactions in november 2002 onechicago our joint venture with cboe and cbot commenced its trading operations to trade single stock futures contracts on stocks trading worldwide as well as futures on narrowbased stock indexes under the terms of our operating agreement we own approximately a 40 interest in onechicago cboe owns approximately a 40 interest and cbot and management each own a minority interest under the terms of our operating agreement until may 31 2005 we are restricted from in any way directly or indirectly engaging in the business of trading marketing regulating selling purchasing clearing or settling transactions in single stock futures other than in conjunction with the joint venture this restriction on our ability to compete applies whether or not we remain part of the joint venture but it does not apply to futures based on narrowbased stock indexes 

  

foreign exchange products we became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in 1972 since that time we have built a strong presence in foreign exchange futures institutions such as banks hedge funds commodity trading advisors corporations and individuals use these products to manage their risks associated with or speculate on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates foreign exchange products represented 53 of our trading volume in 2003 an average of approximately 135000 contracts per day we offer futures and options on futures contracts on 30 currencies including the european union euro japanese yen british pound swiss franc canadian dollar mexican peso australian dollar brazilian real new zealand dollar and south african rand 

  

our total foreign exchange trading volume increased 402 during 2003 from 2002 previously our volume was impacted by the introduction of the euro and subsequent phasing out of many of the major european currencies the continuing consolidation in the financial institutions sector increased use of internal netting mechanisms by our customers and wide use of electronic trading for foreign exchange transactions by competing markets we have begun improving the performance of this product sector by expanding electronic trading in our foreign exchange products we introduced sidebyside electronic and open outcry trading of foreign exchange futures in april 2001 we believe this change has helped facilitate the increase in volume in these products in 2003 electronically traded foreign exchange futures volume increased 1000 over 2002 from approximately 75 million contracts to nearly 149 million contracts and open outcry trading increased 62 from 109 million contracts in 2002 to 115 million contracts in 2003 

  

in may 2002 we introduced 13 new crossrate foreign exchange futures contracts consisting of two us dollarbased contracts and 11 nondollarbased contracts 

  

we expect the growth in our foreign exchange product line to come from further transitioning to electronic trading this will allow us to compete more effectively in an environment where electronic execution is growing rapidly and accounts for a significant portion of global foreign exchange volume the foreign exchange interbank spot market is heavily reliant on electronic trading with the majority of trades brokered online we continue to increase both functionality and distribution and are in discussions to add electronic interfaces with otc market electronic trading platforms we believe these interfaces if successfully implemented will position us to increase our foreign exchange futures volume and expand our product offerings in march 2003 we launched futures contracts and options on futures contracts based on a new dollar index the cmeindex a geometric index of seven foreign currencies that is weighted to reflect the relative competitiveness of us goods in foreign markets cmeindex provides investors with a new instrument for currency speculation and risk management the seven currencies included in the index are the european union euro japanese yen british pound swiss franc australian dollar canadian dollar and swedish krona 

  

commodity products commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business we have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products including futures contracts based on cattle hogs pork bellies lumber weather and dairy products commodity products accounted for 14 of our trading volume during 2003 an average of more than 35000 contracts per day these products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities including agricultural producers of commodities and food processors our commodity products are traded through our open outcry and electronic trading execution facilities we introduced sidebyside electronic and open outcry trading of lean hog live cattle and feeder cattle futures in 2002 and of frozen pork bellies in 2003 

  

trading volume for our commodity products has been relatively stable in recent years we believe continuing consolidation and restructuring in the agricultural sector coupled with the reduction or elimination of government subsidies and the resulting increase in demand for risk management in this sector could create growth in our commodity markets as more producers and processors adopt formal hedging and risk management programs 

  

we intend to leverage our experience in trading futures on physical commodities to jointly develop new commodity products with operators of electronic cash and derivatives trading platforms for example in 2002 we entered into an agreement with nymex to introduce smallersized versions of key nymex energy futures contracts for trading on our globex electronic trading platform the products based on our successful emini stock index contracts are called eminy energy futures and clear at the nymex clearing house in june 2002 eminy crude oil and natural gas futures contracts began trading 

  

market data and information products our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products the market data we supply is central to trading activity in our products and to trading activity in related cash and derivatives markets we sell our market data which includes information about bids offers trades and trade size to banks brokerdealers pension funds investment companies mutual funds insurance companies individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions we distribute our market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets through our electronic facilities we also distribute market data via dedicated networks to approximately 210 worldwide quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges other third party data providers and news services and then resell their consolidated data as of december 31 2003 approximately 60000 

  

subscribers displayed our data on approximately 174000 screens revenues from market data products totaled 532 million or 99 of our net revenues in 2003 

  

we continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by packaging the basic data we have traditionally offered with advanced analytical data and information we have created marketing programs to increase the use of our market data we are developing new business relationships with companies that develop valueadded computerbased applications that process our market data to provide specific insights into the dynamics of trading activity in our products 

  

in march 2002 we expanded the scope of our market data offerings by providing cme equotes direct realtime price quotes to the trading community over the internet through our web site the new service enables users to integrate interactive charting and news services with market data building customized packages of data charting and news that fit their particular needs cme equotes received a 2002 european banking technology award for the best use of information technology in the wholesale banking sector in june 2002 enhancements to our market data interface software reduced customers’ bandwidth requirements 65 to 70 

  

in august 2002 we introduced cme ehistory to automate the process of supplying users with historical price data for our futures and options on futures contracts we launched eaglei in march 2003 featuring realtime quotes and implied prices for outright and calendar spreads on eurodollar contracts traded on the globex platform in april 2003 we launched epx which provides complete realtime pack and bundle prices as well as the pricing data for all 40 underlying eurodollar contracts in may 2003 our equivalents product which displays our realtime currency futures prices and quantities in spot foreign exchange convention was made available to anyone visiting our web site 

  

execution 

  

our trade execution facilities consist of our open outcry trading pits and the globex electronic trading platform both of these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution anonymity and price transparency and are stateoftheart trading environments supported by substantial infrastructure and technology for order routing trade reporting market data dissemination and market surveillance and regulation in addition trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house the chart below shows the range of trade execution choices we provide our customers in some of our key products 

  

   

open outcry trading open outcry trading represented approximately 54 of our total trading volume in 2003 the trading pits are the centralized meeting place for floor traders and floor brokers representing customer orders to trade contracts the trading floors covering approximately 70000 square feet have tiered booths surrounding the pits from which clearing firm personnel can communicate with customers regarding current market activity and prices and receive orders either electronically or by telephone in addition our trading floors display current market information and news on electronic wallboards hung above the pits during 2003 approximately 44 of our clearing and transaction fee revenues were derived from open outcry trading 

  

globex electronic trading we began electronic trading in 1992 using a system developed in partnership with reuters our second generation electronic trading platform was introduced in 1998 and is based on the nouveau système de cotation or nsc owned and licensed to us by euronextparis a subsidiary of euronext nv globex maintains an electronic centralized order book and trade execution algorithm for futures contracts and options on futures contracts and allows users to enter orders directly into the order book initially these systems were used to offer our products to customers after the close of our regular daytime trading sessions today however we trade some of our most successful products on the globex platform more than 23 hours a day five days a week in 2003 441 of our trading volume was executed using globex compared to 355 in 2002 our electronic volume has grown rapidly during the last five years electronic trading volume has increased from nearly 161 million contracts in 1999 to nearly 2824 million contracts in 2003 globex volume exceeded one million contracts for a single day for the first time on june 12 2002 as of december 31 2003 globex had achieved 225 days of volume greater than one million contracts excluding the volume attributable to the firstday trading volumes of trakrs during 2003 approximately 47 of our clearing and transaction fee revenues were derived from electronic trading this was the first year that the percentage of our clearing and transaction fee revenues derived from electronic trading exceeded that derived from open outcry trading 

  

privately negotiated transactions in addition to offering traditional open outcry and electronic trading through the globex platform we permit qualified customers to trade our products by entering into privately negotiated efp and exchange basis facility or ebf transactions and block trades which are reported and included in the market data we distribute we also clear settle and guarantee these transactions through our clearing house some market participants value privately negotiated transactions as a way to ensure that large transactions can be completed at a single price or in a single transaction while preserving their ability to effectively complete a hedging risk management or other trading strategy during 2003 approximately 9 of our clearing and transaction fee revenues were derived from this type of trading 

  

efp and ebf transactions involve privately negotiated exchanges of futures contracts for cash positions or other qualified instruments while efp capabilities have been available for many years and constitute a significant and profitable segment of our foreign exchange futures trading efps have been offered on a restricted basis in some of our other markets we have taken steps to liberalize our trading policies including extending ebf capabilities to all eurodollar futures contracts 

  

a block trade is the privately negotiated purchase and sale of futures contracts block trading was introduced on our exchange in late 2000 and volume has been limited to date we believe block trading provides an important source of access designed to appeal to largescale institutional traders originally these transactions were limited to a certain number of contracts and required high minimum quantity thresholds along with a fee surcharge we have implemented pricing and trading rules designed to increase customer participation we intend to continue to enhance the utility of efp and block transactions while maintaining an appropriate balance with the transactions conducted within the open outcry and electronic trading environments 

  

clearing 

  

we operate our own clearing house that clears settles and guarantees the performance of all transactions matched through our execution facilities and futures and options on futures contracts traded through cbot many derivatives exchanges do not provide clearing services for trades matched through their execution facilities relying instead on outside clearing houses to provide these services ownership and control of our own clearing house enables us to capture the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products this is particularly important for trade execution alternatives such as block trades where we can derive a higher per trade clearing fee compared to other trades by owning our clearing house we also control the cost structure and the technology development cycle for our clearing services it also helps us manage our new product initiatives without being dependent on an outside entity we believe having an integrated clearing function provides significant competitive advantages additionally owning our own clearing house allows us to provide clearing services to other exchanges such as cbot 

  

during 2003 we processed an average of approximately 531000 trade transactions per day with an average transaction size of 95 contracts we maintain the largest futures and options on futures open interest of any exchange in the world as of december 31 2003 our open interest stood at approximately 297 million contracts not including cbot contracts that we managed for cbot our open interest record was approximately 354 million contracts set on december 11 2003 not including the 28 million contracts that we managed for cbot on that day as of december 31 2003 we acted as custodian for approximately 370 billion in performance bond collateral deposited by our clearing firms and during 2003 we moved an average of approximately 14 billion a day in settlement funds through our clearing system in addition our clearing house guarantees the performance of our contracts with a financial safeguards package of approximately 34 billion 

  

in april 2003 we entered into an agreement with cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts transacted through cbot’s execution facilities pursuant to this agreement we began providing clearing services on november 24 2003 for a subset of cbot’s products and as of january 2 2004 we began clearing all of cbot’s remaining products in providing clearing services to cbot our clearing house clears settles and guarantees all cbot transactions using the full resources of our clearing processes and financial safeguards package open interest in cbot products cleared by our clearing house on december 31 2003 was 27 million contracts on january 2 2004 when we began clearing all of cbot’s products open interest in cbot products increased to 73 million contracts 

  

the clearing function provides three primary benefits to our markets efficient highvolume transaction processing cost and capital efficiencies and a reliable credit guarantee the services we provide can be broadly categorized as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

transaction processing and position management we developed a stateoftheart clearing system clearing 21 in conjunction with nymex to provide high quality clearing services this system processes reported trades and positions on a realtime basis providing users with instantaneous information on trades positions and risk exposure clearing 21 is able to process trades in futures and options products securities and cash instruments clearing 21 can also support complex new product types including combinations options on combinations options on options swaps repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and other instruments through clearing 21 user interfaces our clearing firms can electronically manage their positions exercise options enter transactions related to foreign exchange deliveries manage collateral posted to meet performance bond requirements and access all of our other online applications together with our order routing and trade matching services we offer straightthrough electronic processing of transactions in which an order is electronically routed matched cleared and made available to the clearing firm’s backoffice systems for further processing 

  

crossmargining and mutual offset services we have led the derivatives industry in establishing crossmargining agreements with other leading clearing houses crossmargining arrangements reduce capital costs for clearing firms and our customers these agreements permit an individual clearing house to recognize a clearing firm’s open positions at other participating clearing houses and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at other participating clearing houses this reduces the need for collateral deposits by the clearing firm for example our crossmargining program with the options clearing corporation reduces performance bond requirements for our members by approximately 953 million a day we have implemented crossmargining arrangements with the fixed income clearing corporation formerly the government securities clearing corporation and clearnetlch for positions at the london international financial futures and options exchange we have also implemented a crossmargining arrangement with nymex in connection with our agreement to offer eminy energy futures in addition our mos agreement with the singapore derivatives exchange which has been in place since 1984 allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products and then transfer them back to the originating exchange this mos enables firms to seamlessly execute trades at either exchange virtually 24 hours per day 

  

market protection and risk management our clearing house guarantee of performance is a significant attraction and an important part of the functioning of our exchange because of this guarantee our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties this flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade additionally the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party this contract netting process provides our customers with significant flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions 

  

in order to ensure performance we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms we also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products our clearing house uses our proprietary span software which determines 

  

the appropriate performance bond requirements by simulating the gains and losses of complex portfolios we typically hold performance bond collateral to cover at least 95 of price changes for a given product within a given historical period performance bond requirements for a clearing firm’s or customer’s overall portfolio are calculated using span 

  

at each settlement cycle our clearing house values at the market price prevailing at the time or markstomarket all open positions and requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value our clearing house markstomarket all open positions at least twice a day and more often if market volatility warrants markingtomarket provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract 

  

having a marktomarket cycle of a minimum of two times a day helps protect the financial integrity of our clearing house our clearing firms and market participants this allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions 

  

in the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm we would first apply assets of the clearing firm to cover its payment obligation these assets include security deposits performance bonds and any other available assets such as the proceeds from the sale of class a and class b common stock and memberships of the clearing firm at our exchange owned by or assigned to the clearing firm thereafter if the payment default remains unsatisfied we would use our surplus funds security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit we have a secured committed 7500 million line of credit with a consortium of banks in order to provide additional liquidity to address a clearing firm payment default the credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of us treasury or agency securities as well as security deposit funds in our second interest earning facility program called ief2 to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line this line of credit may also be utilized if there is a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay settlement payments between our clearing house and clearing firms 

  

the following shows the available assets of our clearing house at december 31 2003 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm 

  

cme clearing house available assets 

in millions 

  

    

   

   

   

   

settlement collateral and delivery services we manage final settlement in all of our contracts including cash settlement physical delivery of selected commodities and option exercises and assignments because some initial and maintenance performance bonds from clearing firms as well as marktomarket obligations on some of our contracts are denominated in various foreign currencies we offer multicurrency margin and settlement services we also offer the moneychanger service to our clearing firms this service provides members with access to overnight funds in various foreign currencies at competitive bidask spreads free of charge to satisfy the terms of a foreign currency denominated futures contract 

  

although more than 95 of all futures contracts are liquidated before the expiration of the contract the underlying financial instruments or commodities for the remainder of the contracts must be delivered we act as the delivery agent for all contracts ensuring timely delivery by the seller of the exact quality and quantity specified in a contract and full and timely payment by the buyer 

  

in order to administer its system of financial safeguards efficiently our clearing house has developed banking relationships with a network of major us banks and banking industry infrastructure providers such as the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications among the key services provided to our clearing house by these banks and service providers are a variety of custody credit and payment services that support the substantial financial commitments and processes backing the guarantee of our clearing house to market participants 

  

investment services in order to achieve collateral efficiencies for our clearing firms we have also established our interest earning facility or ief program which allows participating clearing firms to pool their funds and have the funds managed by third party investment managers to allow clearing firms to enhance the yields they receive on their performance bond collateral deposited with our clearing house the first iefs were organized in 1997 as two limited liability companies interest earned net of expenses is passed on to participating clearing firms the principal of the first iefs is guaranteed by us the investment portfolio of these facilities is managed by two of the exchange’s approved settlement banks and eligible investments include us treasury bills and notes us treasury strips and reverse repurchase agreements the maximum average portfolio maturity is 90 days and the maximum maturity for an individual security is 13 months we believe that the market risk exposure relating to our guarantee of the principal is not material to the financial statements taken as a whole in 2002 ief2 was organized ief2 offers clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in shares of approved money market mutual funds dividends earned on these shares net of fees are solely for the account of the clearing firm on whose behalf the shares were purchased the principal of ief2 is not guaranteed by us in 2003 ief3 was launched ief3 is a specialized collateral program that utilizes various services and methods of processing that are most typically associated with triparty repossession unlike the ief and ief2 programs our ief3 program does 

  

not employ an interest rate component this program is simply a mechanism that allows clearing firms to pledge a wider range of collateral than we have typically accepted as of december 31 2003 clearing firms had more than 143 billion in balances in ief ief2 and ief3 funds compared to 122 billion at december 31 2002 our clearing house earns fee income in return for providing these valueadded services to our clearing firms 

  

our clearing house launched a securities lending program in 2001 using a portion of certain securities deposited to meet the proprietary performance bond requirements of our clearing firms under this securities lending program we lend a security to a third party and receive collateral in the form of cash the majority of the cash is then invested on an overnight basis to generate interest income the related interest expense represents payment to the borrower of the security for the cash collateral retained during the duration of the lending transaction securities on loan are markedtomarket daily and compared to collateral received the securities lending activity utilizes some of the securities deposited by clearing firms 

  

technology 

  

our operation of both trading facilities and a clearing house has influenced the design and implementation of the technologies that support our operations 

  

trading technology we have a proven track record of operating successful open outcry and electronic markets by developing and integrating multiple evolving technologies that support a growing and substantial trading volume the integrated suite of technologies we employ to accomplish this has been designed to support a significant expansion of our current business and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our technology base into new markets products and services 

  

as electronic trading activity expands we continue to provide greater match engine functionality unique to various markets market models and product types we have adopted a modular approach to technology development and engineered an integrated set of solutions that support multiple specialized markets we continually monitor and upgrade our capacity requirements our goal is to design our systems to handle at least twice our peak transactions in our highest volume products significant investments in production planning quality assurance and certification processes have enhanced our ability to expedite the delivery of the system enhancements that we develop for our customers 

  

speed reliability scalability capacity and functionality are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms a substantial portion of our operating budget is dedicated to system design development and operations in order to achieve high levels of overall system performance for example to respond to customer requests and bring down the cost of trading for our european customers we established a telecommunications hub in london in early 2002 in 2004 we plan to add telecommunications hubs in amsterdam dublin frankfurt gibraltar milan and paris in late september 2002 we also launched a remote data center to provide additional system capacity and redundancy for our trading and clearing technology the remote data center features an entirely new network to enhance data base and order routing servers and to improve overall system performance and functionality our data centers support our customer interfaces trading and execution systems as well as clearing and settlement operations 

  

the technology systems supporting our trading operations can be divided into four major categories 

  

   

the globex electronic trading platform includes distribution order routing order management and trade matching technology the modularity and functionality of globex enable us to selectively add products with unique trading characteristics onto the trading platform with minimal additional investment 

  

the distribution technologies we offer differentiate our platform and bring liquidity and trading volume to our execution facilities as of december 31 2003 nearly 1100 customers connected directly with us and thousands more connected with us through 22 independent software vendors and data centers as well as 34 clearing firms that have interfaces with our systems many of these customers connect through a dedicated private framerelay network that is readily available has wide distribution and provides fast connections in the americas europe and asia we have initiated efforts to provide additional access choices to customers in early 2001 we implemented a webbased virtual private network solution globex traderinternet for our lowervolume customers this added a lowcost alternative that was the first of its kind among major exchanges approximately 251 customers currently use globex traderinternet 

  

in order routing and management we offer a range of mechanisms and were among the first us derivatives exchanges to fully implement the fix 42 protocol—the standard order routing protocol used within the securities industry in addition our order routing and order management systems are capable of supporting multiple electronic trading match engines this functionality gives us great latitude in the types of markets that we choose to serve 

  

several key technology platforms and standards are used to support these activities including faulttolerant tandem systems ibm mainframes sun microsystems servers hp and dell pcs oracle and db2 databases unix windows nt novell unicenter tng software systems tibco middleware and multivendor frame relay and virtual private network solutions 

  

our match engine is based upon the computerized trading and match software known as the nsc system we have a longterm license from euronextparis under which we have the ability to modify and upgrade the performance of the basic nsc system to optimize its performance to suit our needs we have a fully trained development team that maintains upgrades and customizes our version of the nsc system for example despite a large increase in trading volume we reduced the average customer response time from 023 seconds at the beginning of 2003 to 017 seconds at yearend allowing trades to be executed more quickly and consistently the customized enhancements that we have developed address the unique trading demands of each marketplace that we serve we continue to focus on performance features of the match engine and presently have multiple enhancements under development 

  

clearing technology clearing 21 our clearing and settlement software and span our margining and risk management software form the core of our clearing technology 

  

clearing 21 is a system for highvolume highcapacity clearing and settlement of exchangebased transactions that we developed jointly with nymex the system offers clearing firms improved efficiency and reduced costs clearing 21’s modular design gives us the ability to rapidly introduce new products the software can be customized to meet the unique needs of specialized markets 

  

span is our sophisticated margining and risk management software span has now been adopted by 46 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide this software simulates the effects of changing market conditions on a complex portfolio and uses standard options pricing models to determine a portfolio’s overall risk span then generates a performance bond requirement that typically covers 95 of price changes within a given historical period 

  

strategic relationships 

  

cbot in april 2003 we entered into an agreement with cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts we began providing clearing services for cbot’s agricultural equity index and a subset of cbot’s interest rate products on november 24 2003 and as of january 2 2004 we began clearing all of cbot’s remaining products in providing services to cbot our clearing house clears settles and guarantees all cbot transactions using the full resources of our clearing processes and financial safeguards package we cleared 95 million contracts for cbot in 2003 open interest for cbot contracts cleared by us was 27 million contracts at december 31 2003 

  

tokyo stock exchange in october 2000 we signed a nonbinding letter of intent to pursue a global alliance with the tokyo stock exchange with the goal of further developing our respective fixedincome and equity derivatives markets in march 2002 we introduced sptopix 150 stock index futures on our electronic globex platform during the hours they are not available on the tokyo stock exchange 

  

new york mercantile exchange we entered into an agreement in 2002 with nymex to introduce smallsized versions of key nymex energy futures contracts for trading on our globex electronic trading platform the products based on our successful emini stock index contracts are called eminy energy futures and clear at the nymex clearing house on june 17 2002 eminy crude oil and natural gas futures contracts began trading as part of the agreement we now offer a crossmargining program creating capital efficiencies for market professionals and proprietary accounts by calculating performance bond requirements based on specified positions in both markets in addition globex terminals are available to nymex market participants on the nymex trading floor and other market participants are able to connect to globex through a variety of access channels during the term of the agreement and for one year thereafter we are generally prohibited other than in cooperation with nymex from providing for or facilitating electronic trading in futures or options on futures contracts on any underlying commodity or index of such commodities that is also the underlying commodity for a product listed for trading by nymex 

  

korea futures exchange in october 2002 we signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding with the korea futures exchange to pursue joint business development initiatives in derivatives products 

  

singapore derivatives exchange ltd in 1984 we entered into a mos agreement with the singapore derivatives exchange and in november 2003 we entered into an extension of the mos agreement this relationship allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute afterhours trades at the other exchange in those products then transfer them back to the originating exchange 

  

shanghai futures exchange in march 2003 we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the shanghai futures exchange or shfe to pursue joint business development initiatives in derivatives products the agreement is the first of its kind between shfe and a north american exchange 

  

marketing programs and advertising 

  

our marketing programs primarily target institutional customers and to a lesser extent individual traders our marketing programs for institutional customers aim to inform traders portfolio managers corporate treasurers and other market professionals about novel uses of our products such as new hedging and risk management strategies we also strive to educate these users about changes in product design performance bond requirements and new clearing services we participate in major domestic and international trade shows and seminars regarding futures and options on futures and other derivatives products in addition we sponsor educational workshops and marketing events designed to educate market users about our products through these relationships and programs we attempt to understand the needs of our customer base and use information provided by them to drive our product development efforts 

  

our advertising strategies seek to increase awareness and perceptions of us among our institutional and retail customers as well as support an increase in our trading volume our primary method of advertising has been through print media utilizing trade magazines and newsletters as well as daily business publications however we also use online television sponsorship and some outofhome media to reach our audiences 

  

competition 

  

until the passage of the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 futures trading was generally required to take place on or subject to the rules of a federally designated contract market the costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation complying with applicable regulatory requirements establishing efficient execution facilities and liquidity pools and attracting customers created significant barriers to entry the commodity futures modernization act has eroded the historical dominance by the exchanges of futures trading in the united states by among other things permitting private transactions in most futures contracts and similar products and authorizing the use of electronic trading systems to conduct both private and public futures transactions for a more detailed description of the regulation of our industry and the regulatory changes brought on by the commodity futures modernization act see the section of this annual report on form 10k entitled “item 1 business—regulatory matters” 

  

these changing market dynamics have led to increasing competition in all aspects of our business and from a number of different domestic and international sources of varied size business objectives and resources we now face competition from other futures securities and securities option exchanges otc markets and clearing organizations consortia formed by our members and large market participants alternative trade execution facilities technology firms including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers and other competitors 

  

at yearend 2003 there were 52 futures exchanges located in 27 countries including 7 futures exchanges in the united states on february 8 2004 eurex commenced operation of its us derivatives exchange us futures exchange llc or eurex us eurex us’s initial competitive efforts are directed at cbot but we anticipate that it may begin trading our products in the near future in january 2004 euronextliffe announced that it would begin listing and trading eurodollar futures contracts as early as march 2004 additionally because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets we also compete with securities and options exchanges including the new york stock exchange and cboe dealer markets such as nasdaq and alternative trading systems 

  

otc markets for foreign exchange and fixedincome derivatives products also compete with us the largest foreign exchange markets are operated primarily as electronic trading systems two of the largest of these operated by electronic broking services and reuters plc serve primarily professional foreign exchange trading firms additional electronic platforms designed to serve corporate foreign exchange users are beginning to emerge two of these are operated by consortia of interdealer and interbank market participants a third is a proprietary trading system these systems present significant potential competitive challenges to the growth of our foreign exchange futures markets 

  

the otc fixedincome derivatives market is by far the largest fixedincome derivatives marketplace the otc market consists primarily of interbank and interdealer market participants there is currently no single liquidity pool in the otc fixedincome derivatives market that is comparable to our eurodollar markets the otc market for fixedincome derivatives products has traditionally been limited to more customized products and the large credit exposures created in this market and the absence of clearing facilities have limited participation to the most creditworthy institutional participants however the size of this market and technologydriven developments in electronic trading and clearing facilities as well as regulatory changes implemented by the commodity futures modernization act increase the likelihood that one or more substantial liquidity pools will emerge in the future in the otc fixedincome derivatives market 

  

alternative trade execution facilities that currently specialize in the trading of equity securities have electronic trade execution and routing systems that also can be used to trade products that compete with our products while these firms generally may lack overall market liquidity and distribution capability typically they have advanced electronic and internet technology significant capitalization and competitive pricing in addition while there is currently relatively little electronic trading of otc equity derivatives and the greatest portion of this market is conducted through privately negotiated transactions it is likely that one or more otc equity derivatives markets will emerge in the future 

  

technology companies market data and information vendors and frontend software vendors also represent potential competitors because as purveyors of market data these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities as technology firms they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks additionally technology and software firms that develop trading systems hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets 

  

we also face a threat of trading volume loss if a significant number of our traditional participants decide to trade futures or similar products among themselves without using any exchange or specific trading system the commodity futures modernization act allows nearly all of our largest customers to transact futures or similar products directly with each other while those transactions raise liquidity and credit concerns they may be attractive based on execution costs flexibility of terms negotiability of margin or collateral deposits or other considerations additionally changes under the commodity futures modernization act permitting the establishment of standalone clearing facilities for futures and otc derivatives transactions will facilitate the mitigation of creditrisk concentrations arising from such transactions 

  

we believe competition in the derivatives and securities businesses is based on a number of factors including among others 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and that our deep liquid markets breadth of product offerings rate and quality of new product development and efficient secure settlement clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors we believe that in order to maintain our competitive position we must continue to develop new and innovative products enhance our technology infrastructure including its reliability and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs 

  

we expect competition in our businesses to intensify as potential competitors expand into our markets particularly as a result of technological advances and the commodity futures modernization act and other changes introduced by the commodity futures trading commission or cftc that have reduced the regulatory requirements for the development and entry of products and markets that are competitive with our own additional factors that may intensify competition in the future include an increase in the number of forprofit exchanges the consolidation of our customer base or intermediary base an increased acceptance of electronic trading and electronic order routing by our customer base and the increasing ease and falling cost of other exchanges leveraging their technology investment and electronic distribution to enter new markets and list the products of other exchanges 

  

in addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services including 

  

   

   

we believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on among other things the cost of the services provided quality and reliability of the services timely delivery of the services reputation and value of linking with existing products markets and distribution 

  

regulatory matters 

  

the commodity exchange act the scope of which was significantly expanded in 1974 subjected us to comprehensive regulation by the cftc under the 1974 amendments the cftc was granted exclusive jurisdiction over futures contracts and options on such contracts and on commodities such contracts were generally required to be traded on regulated exchanges known as contract markets the commodity exchange act placed our business in a heavily regulated environment but imposed significant barriers to unregulated competition 

  

between 1974 and december 2000 the barriers against unregulated competitors were eroded the commodity exchange act’s exchange trading requirement was modified by cftc regulations and interpretations to permit privately negotiated swap contracts meeting specified requirements to be transacted in the otc market at june 30 2003 according to data from the bank for international settlements the total estimated notional amount of outstanding otc derivatives contracts was nearly 170 trillion compared to approximately 38 trillion for exchangetraded futures and options on futures contracts the cftc exemption and interpretations under which the otc derivatives market operated precluded the otc market from using exchangelike electronic transaction systems and clearing facilities 

  

the commodity futures modernization act which became effective on december 21 2000 significantly altered the regulatory landscape and may have important competitive consequences this legislation greatly expanded the freedom of regulated markets like ours to innovate and respond to competition it also permits us to offer a previously prohibited set of products—single stock futures and futures on narrowbased indexes of securities the provisions that permit us to trade these security futures products require a novel sharing of jurisdiction between the cftc and the securities and exchange commission or sec exchange trading of these security futures products is subject to more burdensome regulation than our other futures products for example in order to trade these products we are required to “notice register” with the sec as a special purpose national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading security futures products and the sec is authorized to review some of our rules relating to these security futures products our members trading those products are subject to registration requirements and duties and obligations to customers under the securities laws that do not pertain to their other futures business 

  

the commodity futures modernization act excluded or exempted many of the activities of our nonexchange competitors from regulation under the commodity exchange act the commodity futures modernization act created broad exclusions and exemptions from the commodity exchange act that permit derivatives contracts which may serve the same or similar functions as the contracts we offer to be sold in the largely unregulated otc market including through electronic trading facilities 

  

additionally the commodity futures modernization act permits secregulated and bank clearing organizations to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that such clearing organizations have traditionally cleared the commodity futures modernization act also permits banks and brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to offer and sell foreign exchange futures to retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act 

  

the commodity futures modernization act created a new flexible regulatory framework for us in our capacity as a cftc registrant and eliminated many prescriptive requirements of the commodity exchange act and cftc in favor of more flexible core principles for instance cftcregulated exchanges may now list new contracts and adopt new rules without prior cftc approval under selfcertification procedures permitting more timely product launch and modification 

  

for regulated markets the commodity futures modernization act creates a new threetiered regulatory structure the degree of regulation is related to the characteristics of the product and the type of customer that has direct or indirect access to the market with retail customer markets being subject to greater regulation the new threetiered regulatory structure is as follows 

  

   

   

   

our existing market which trades a broad range of products and permits intermediaries to represent unsophisticated customers is subject to the most thorough oversight as a designated contract market the commodity futures modernization act permits us to organize markets that are subject to lesser regulation depending on the types of products traded and the types of traders markets can be organized that trade only products that are unlikely to be susceptible to manipulation and permit direct trading only among institutional participants in order to achieve a less intrusive degree of oversight 

  

the commodity futures modernization act also provides for regulation of derivatives clearing organizations or dcos like our clearing house separately from the exchanges for which they clear contracts and permits dcos to clear a range of otctraded products in addition to products traded on an exchange the commodity futures modernization act requires a dco that clears for a registered futures exchange to register with the cftc however our clearing house was deemed to be registered by reason of its activities prior to enactment of the commodity futures modernization act a dco may accept for clearing any new contract or may adopt any new rule or rule amendment by providing to the cftc a written certification that the new contract rule or rule amendment complies with the commodity exchange act alternatively the dco may request that the cftc grant prior approval to any contract rule or rule amendment and the cftc must grant approval within 75 days unless the cftc finds that the proposed contract rule or rule amendment would violate the commodity exchange act 

  

from time to time it is proposed in congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated including a possible merger between the cftc and the sec while those proposals have not been adopted to date the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely to the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

  

from time to time it is proposed in the president’s budget that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions while those proposals have not been adopted to date except for a percontract fee on single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the imposition of any such tax could increase the cost of using our products and consequently our business financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected 

  

our members 

  

as a result of our conversion into a forprofit corporation in the fall of 2000 individuals and entities who at the time were members and owned trading rights on our exchange became the owners of all of the outstanding equity of cme in our reorganization into a holding company structure cme shareholders exchanged their shares for shares of cme holdings cme shareholders that were members and owned trading rights on our exchange retained them after the merger owners of trading rights on our exchange owned of record approximately 69 of our outstanding class a common stock as of december 31 2003 cme members can execute trades for their own accounts the clearing firm accounts of other members or for the accounts of customers of clearing firms members who trade for their own account including those who lease trading rights qualify for lower transaction fees in recognition of the market liquidity that their trading activity provides these members also benefit from market information advantages that may accrue from their proximity to activity on the trading floors generally member customers are charged lower fees than our nonmember customers in 2003 our members were responsible for nearly 80 of our total trading volume there are four divisions of membership at our exchange the chicago mercantile exchange or cme division the international monetary market or imm division the index and option market or iom division and the growth and emerging markets or gem division each membership division has different trading rights membership applicants planning to access the trading floor are subject to a review and approval process prior to becoming members and obtaining trading rights we also have individual trading members and clearing firms

certain factors that may affect our business 

  

in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 

  

our shareholders who are members and own trading rights on our exchange and who may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members currently own more than a majority of our voting stock shareholders who own trading rights on our exchange account for 15 of the 20 directors on our board and currently have the ability to control the election of all directors our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members combined with their ability to control the election of directors enables them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business 

  

as of december 31 2003 we estimated that our shareholders who own trading rights on our exchange together owned of record shares representing approximately 69 of our outstanding class a common stock as a result they will if voting in the same manner control all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval including electing directors and approving changes of control as of december 31 2003 15 of the 20 directors on our board owned or were officers or directors of others who own memberships on our exchange in addition we are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members this dependence also gives them substantial influence over how we operate our business 

  

many of our trading members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchange in addition trading rights on our exchange have substantial independent value the amount of income that members derive from their trading brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade broker clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets our trading members many of whom act as floor brokers and floor traders benefit from trading rules membership privileges and fee discounts that enhance their open outcry trading opportunities and profits our predominantly electronic trading members benefit from fee discounts and transaction fee caps that enhance their electronic trading opportunities and profits our clearing firms benefit from all of the foregoing as well as decisions that increase electronic trading which over time will reduce their costs of doing business on our exchange as a result holders of our class a common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members in addition our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the role they serve in our markets their method of trading and the products they trade consequently members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us represented by class a common stock they own 

  

the share ownership of our members in combination with their board representation rights and charter provision protections described in the immediately following risk factor could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value 

  

our certificate of incorporation grants special rights to holders of class b common stock which protect their trading rights and give them special board representation and requires that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant 

  

under the terms of our certificate of incorporation our class b shareholders have the ability to protect their rights to trade on our exchange by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of our markets in particular these provisions include a grant to the holders of our class b common stock of the right to approve any changes to 

  

   

   

   

   

our class b shareholders are also entitled to elect six of the 20 directors on our board even if their class a share ownership interest is very small 

  

our certificate of incorporation also includes a provision requiring us to maintain open outcry floor trading on our exchange for a particular traded product as long as the open outcry market is “liquid” our certificate of incorporation requires us to maintain a facility for conducting business disseminating price information clearing and delivery and to provide reasonable financial support for technology marketing and research for open outcry markets our certificate of incorporation provides specific tests as to whether an open outcry market will be deemed liquid as measured on a quarterly basis if a market is deemed illiquid as a result of a failure to meet any of these tests our board will determine whether or not that market will be closed 

  

our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions many of which are beyond our control and could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile 

  

we generate revenues primarily from our trade execution services clearing services and market data and information services we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future each of these revenue sources is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets our trading volume is directly affected by us domestic and international factors that are beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets our operating results and trading volume tend to increase during periods of global and domestic economic and geopolitical uncertainty this is because our customers seek to hedge or manage the risks associated with volatility in the us equity markets fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange and commodities markets the future economic environment will be subject to periodic downturns including possible recession and lower volatility in financial markets and may not be as favorable as it has been in recent years as a result periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful trends less favorable than those of recent periods could result in decreased trading volume decreased capital formation and a more difficult business environment for us material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

  

our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to seasonality and a number of other factors as a result you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance 

  

a number of factors beyond our control may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our operating results—particularly in our quarterly results in the three years prior to 2001 we experienced relatively higher volume during the first and second quarters and we generally expect that the third and fourth quarters will have lower trading volume this trend was not evident in 2001 or 2002 except for the fourth quarter of 2002 in part because of the volatility of interest rates and us equities in the third quarter in each of those years as a result of seasonality and the factors described in the preceding risk factors you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance if we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating performance the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially 

  

our cost structure is largely fixed if we are unable to reduce our costs if our revenues decline our profitability will be adversely affected 

  

our cost structure is largely fixed we base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services if demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis in that event our profitability will be adversely affected 

  

the global trend toward electronic trading may divert volume away from our open outcry trading facilities our revenues profits and stock price will be adversely affected if we experience reductions in our open outcry trading volume that are not offset by increases in our electronic trading volume 

  

both newly formed organizations and established exchanges are increasingly employing trading systems that provide fast lowcost execution of trades by matching buyers and sellers electronically these organizations are attracting order flow away from some traditional open outcry trading markets many market participants believe that these electronic trading systems represent a threat to the continued viability of the open outcry method of trading some major european and asian futures exchanges have closed their traditional open outcry trading facilities and replaced them entirely with electronic systems although we offer an electronic trading system in 2003 approximately 44 of our revenues from clearing and transaction fees are generated by open outcry trading reductions in our open outcry trading volume that are not offset by increases in our electronic trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our revenue earnings and stock price 

  

the success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic marketplaces that have the functionality performance reliability speed and liquidity required by customers 

  

the future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality performance reliability speed and liquidity to attract and retain customers a significant portion of our current overall volume is generated through electronic trading of our emini sp 500 and emini nasdaq100 products however during 2003 approximately 54 of our volume and approximately 44 of our clearing and transaction fee revenues were generated through our open outcry trading facilities most of that open outcry volume is related to trading in eurodollar contracts our electronic functionality may not be capable of accommodating all of the complex trading strategies typically used for trading our eurodollar contracts we have implemented electronic system upgrades and have acquired technologyrelated assets and intellectual property of liquidity direct to incorporate additional technology into our globex electronic platform in addition we are developing additional functionality to accommodate more eurodollar trading strategies we may not complete the development of or successfully implement the required electronic functionality for our eurodollar marketplace including the integration and operation of the technologyrelated assets and intellectual property of liquidity direct moreover our eurodollar customers may not accept our electronic trading systems in either event our ability to increase our electronic eurodollar trading volume would be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets or if our electronic marketplaces do not have the required functionality performance reliability speed and liquidity we may not be able to compete successfully in a new environment that we expect to be increasingly dominated by electronic trading 

  

we maintain the simultaneous operation of open outcry trading and electronic trade execution facilities which may over time prove to be inefficient and costly and ultimately adversely affect our profitability 

  

currently we maintain both open outcry trade execution facilities and electronic trade execution facilities for some products we maintain sidebyside trading facilities for both open outcry and electronic trading we are obligated through the inclusion of provisions in our certificate of incorporation to maintain the operation of our open outcry trading facilities until the trading volumes in them are not significant if we continue to operate both trading facilities for the same product liquidity of markets on each may be less than the liquidity of competing markets on a unified trading platform in addition it may be expensive to continue operating two trading systems for the same product we may incur substantial expenses and experience delays because of our efforts to create trading links between the separate trading platforms to facilitate trading on both systems any loss of efficiency or increase in time to market of new or improved products could be detrimental to our business in addition we may expend resources on the maintenance of our open outcry facilities that could be more efficiently used to develop our capacity and reduce our costs in the increasingly competitive market for electronic trading facilities 

  

the development of our electronic trading facilities exposes us to risks inherent in operating in the new and evolving market for electronic transaction services if we do not successfully develop our electronic trading facilities or if our customers do not accept them our revenues profits and stock price will be adversely affected 

  

we must further develop our electronic trading facilities to remain competitive as a result we will continue to be subject to risks expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services these risks include our failure or inability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we do not successfully develop our electronic trading facilities or our current or potential customers do not accept them our revenues profits and stock price will be adversely affected 

  

if we are not able to keep up with rapid technological changes our business will be materially harmed 

  

to remain competitive we must continue to improve the responsiveness functionality accessibility and other features of our software network distribution systems and technologies the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology changes in customer demand and uses of our products and services frequent product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing technology and systems obsolete our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological advancements and changing standards in a timely costefficient and competitive manner we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our technology to customer and competitive requirements or emerging industry standards 

  

we face intense competition from other companies including some of our members if we are not able to successfully compete our business will not survive 

  

the derivatives securities and financial services industries are highly competitive we expect that competition will intensify in the future our current and prospective competitors both domestically and around the world are numerous they include securities and securities option exchanges futures exchanges otc markets clearing organizations market data and information vendors electronic communications networks crossing systems and similar entities consortia of large customers consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities at december 31 2003 there were 52 futures exchanges located in 27 countries including 7 futures exchanges in the united states on february 8 2004 eurex commenced operation of its us derivatives exchange eurex us eurex us’s initial competitive efforts are directed at cbot but we anticipate that it may begin trading our products in the near future in january 2004 euronextliffe announced that it would begin listing and trading our eurodollar future contracts as early as march 2004 

  

we believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies the number of businesses providing internetrelated financial services is rapidly growing other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may become competitive with us through acquisitions recent changes in federal law allow institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial marketing technological and personnel resources than we do these factors may enable them to develop similar products to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can in addition our competitors may 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our products markets and services are not competitive our business financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed in addition even if new entrants do not significantly erode our market share we may be required to reduce our fees significantly to remain competitive which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

  

the enactment of the commodity futures modernization act will increase competition and enable many of our customers to trade futures contracts other than on exchanges these events could result in lower trading volume revenue and profits 

  

our industry has been subject to several fundamental regulatory changes including changes in the statute under which we have operated since 1974 the commodity exchange act generally required all futures contracts to be executed on an exchange that has been approved by the cftc the exchange trading requirement was modified by cftc regulations and interpretations to permit privately negotiated swap contracts to be transacted in the otc market the cftc exemption under which the otc derivatives market operated precluded the otc market from using exchangelike electronic transaction systems and clearing facilities these barriers to competition from the otc market were largely repealed by the commodity futures modernization act it is possible that the chief beneficiaries of the commodity futures modernization act will be otc dealers and competitors that operate or intend to open electronic trading facilities or to conduct their futures business directly among themselves on a bilateral basis the customers who may access these trading facilities or engage in bilateral private transactions are the same customers who account for a substantial portion of our trading volume the commodity futures modernization act also permits banks brokerdealers and some of their affiliates to engage in foreign exchange futures transactions for or with retail customers without being subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act 

  

the commodity futures modernization act also permits bank clearing organizations and clearing organizations regulated by the sec to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that these clearing organizations have traditionally cleared this allocation of jurisdiction may be advantageous to competing clearing organizations and result in a lower volume of trading cleared through our clearing house 

  

our members may seek alternative trading venues and products and negatively impact the liquidity of our markets and our trading volume 

  

the trading activities of our members accounted for nearly 80 of our trading volume during 2003 when we became a forprofit company we changed the role of our members in the operation of our business we eliminated many memberdominated committees or converted them into advisory bodies we gave our professional staff greater decisionmaking responsibilities subject to the oversight of our board of directors our management is charged with making decisions that are designed to enhance shareholder value which may lead to decisions or outcomes with which our members disagree these changes may make us less attractive to our members and encourage them to conduct their business at or seek membership in another exchange or to trade in equivalent products among themselves on a private bilateral basis a material decrease in member trading activity would negatively impact liquidity and trading volume in our products and reduce our revenues a loss or material reduction in the number of our clearing firms and the capital they provide to guarantee their trades and the trades of their customers would also diminish the strength and attractiveness of our clearing house and our markets 

  

despite our governance changes our dependence on our members gives them substantial influence over how we operate our business members could use their ownership of class a and class b common stock and ability to elect our board of directors to change or modify our policies or business practices with which they do not agree 

  

our trading volume and consequently our revenues and profits would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange 

  

the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume to do so we must maintain and expand our product offerings our customer base and our trade execution alternatives our success also depends on our ability to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business in addition our success depends on our ability to increase the base of individual customers who trade our products we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers we also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to lowcost competitors with comparable or superior products services or trade execution facilities if we fail to expand our product offerings or execution facilities or lose a substantial number of our current customers or are unable to attract new customers our business will be adversely affected 

  

any significant decline in the trading volume of our eurodollar sp 500 or nasdaq100 futures and options on futures contracts or in privately negotiated foreign exchange transactions using our clearing house would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

  

we are substantially dependent on trading volume from three product offerings for a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits the clearing and transaction fee revenues attributable to transactions in our eurodollar contracts all our contracts based on the sp 500 and nasdaq100 including our emini products and privately negotiated foreign exchange transactions using our clearing house were approximately 36 35 12 and 8 respectively of our total clearing and transaction fee revenues during 2003 and approximately 40 32 13 and 7 respectively during 2002 any significant decline in our trading volume in any of these products would negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results 

  

we believe our eurodollar product serves as a global financial benchmark but we cannot assure you that in the future other products will not become preferred alternatives to the eurodollar contract as a means of managing or speculating on interest rate risk we also cannot assure you that competitors will not enter the eurodollar market for example in january 2004 euronextliffe announced that would it would begin listing and trading eurodollar futures contracts as early as march 2004 our members may also elect to trade eurodollars in privately negotiated bilateral transactions without the use of our clearing house in either of these events our trading volume revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 

  

our rights to the standard  poor’s and nasdaq products were obtained through licensing arrangements our license agreement with standard  poor’s provides that the sp 500 index futures products will be exclusive until december 31 2008 and nonexclusive from december 31 2008 until december 31 2013 

  

in october 2003 we extended and expanded our license agreement with the nasdaq stock market inc to license both the nasdaq100 index and the nasdaq composite index to us for trading futures and options on futures contracts that are based on the indexes our license with nasdaq is exclusive with respect to futures and options on futures contracts based on the nasdaq100 index through october 9 2007 with an automatic renewal until october 9 2011 

  

we cannot assure you that either of our standard  poor’s or nasdaq license agreements will be renewed when they terminate in addition we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use alternative instruments including securities and options based on the sp and nasdaq indexes to manage or speculate on us stock risks we also cannot assure you that 

  

nasdaq will not directly or indirectly through other exchanges offer security futures contracts that compete with our broadbased index futures contracts based upon nasdaq indexes currently nqlx llc offers futures contracts based on an exchangetraded fund called qqq which may compete with our nasdaq100 futures contracts any of these events could have an adverse effect on our trading volume revenues and profits 

  

our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties our financial condition will be adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

  

our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our exchange and for cbot futures and options on futures as a result we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties including our clearing firms we are also exposed indirectly to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons a substantial part of our working capital is at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations although we have policies and procedures to help assure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults we also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity however we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default 

  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our agreement to provide clearing and related services for cbot products 

  

in april 2003 we entered into an agreement with cbot to provide clearing and related services for cbot futures and options on futures contracts under the terms of the agreement clearing services for commodity equity and some interest rate products began in november 2003 and for all other cbot futures and options on futures contracts on january 2 2004 the initial term of the agreement is four years with three year renewals upon the mutual consent of the parties under the terms of the agreement cbot will pay us a fee for the clearing services we provide this fee will vary based on transaction volume but is guaranteed to be at least 45 million per quarter pursuant to the agreement cbot reimbursed us 20 million in initial development costs cbot will also reimburse us for the ongoing costs associated with the telecommunications equipment and services that are necessary for us to provide clearing services 

  

our anticipated net revenues and net income from providing these clearing services will be dependent on cbot’s ability to maintain andor expand its trading volume which is subject to a number of factors beyond cbot’s control as a futures exchange cbot’s ability to maintain or expand its volume and operate its business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject for example on february 8 2004 eurex launched a registered us derivatives exchange eurex us which initially offers among other products contracts on us treasury notes and bonds in direct competition with contracts currently traded at cbot our net income from the clearing services we provide to cbot will also depend on our ability to control our costs associated with providing the clearing services 

  

our agreement with cbot provides that both we and cbot may terminate the agreement in some circumstances we cannot assure you that the agreement will not be terminated prior to the end of its term or that we will be able to realize the anticipated benefits of our clearing agreement with cbot any such event could have an adverse effect on the price of our class a common stock 

  

our market data fees may be reduced or eliminated by the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems if we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees we will experience a reduction in revenue 

  

electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate charges for supplying market data to trading terminals if we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available we would lose quote fee revenue from those who have access to trading terminals we will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost quote fee revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees 

  

if we experience systems failures or capacity constraints our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities 

  

we are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations we receive andor process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means such as through public and private communications networks our systems or those of our third party providers may fail or operate slowly causing one or more of the following to occur 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure acts of god war or terrorism human error natural disasters fire sabotage hardware or software malfunctions or defects computer viruses acts of vandalism or similar events if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled including as a result of system failure customer error or misuse of our systems we could suffer financial loss liability to customers regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market 

  

from time to time we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or erroneous reporting such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled in september 2002 and may 2003 we experienced hardware failures that resulted in a temporary suspension of trading on our globex platform the impact of these events has not been material 

  

our status as a cftc registrant requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time we constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume however we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance for example as of december 31 2003 globex had achieved 225 days of volume greater than one million contracts excluding the volume attributable to the firstday trading volumes of trakrs during the initial period of increased globex trading volume there were instances of connectivity problems or erroneous reports that affected some users of the platform system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations file lawsuits against us or cease doing business with us or could lead the cftc or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 

  

we will need to continue to upgrade expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy our goal is to design our systems to handle at least twice our peak transactions in our highest volume products as volumes grow the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity 

  

on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate increased volume and to provide transaction processing and business services to third parties if we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected 

  

some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit these clearing firms are seeking legislative or regulatory changes that would if adopted enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchange even if they are not successful these factors may cause them to limit or stop the use of our markets 

  

some of our largest clearing firms which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products have increasingly stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as forprofit enterprises some of these firms along with the futures industry association are attempting to cause legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchangeowned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution and clearing and settlement business if these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish or seek to use alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchange even if they are not successful in their efforts the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets if any of these events occur our revenues and profits would be adversely affected 

  

we depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important to our business an interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we depend on a number of suppliers such as banking clearing and settlement organizations telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading clearing and other systems as well as communications and networking equipment computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs an interruption in or the cessation of an important supply or service by any third party and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner or at all would result in lost revenue and higher costs 

  

our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities we could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems 

  

we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations our networks and those of our third party service providers our members and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses and other security problems persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities 

  

we operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business 

  

although the commodity futures modernization act significantly reduced our regulatory burdens we remain extensively regulated by the cftc our international operations may be subject to similar regulations in specific jurisdictions we are registered in the united kingdom australia japan and hong kong in some cases our registrations are subject to annual review and such reviews may subject us to additional requirements in the future we may also be required to register or become subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in order to accept business from customers in those jurisdictions 

  

many aspects of our operations are subject to oversight and regulation by the cftc our activities relating to single stock and narrowbased stock index futures products will also be subject to oversight by the sec our operations are subject to ongoing review and oversight including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

if we fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business removal of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization changes in laws regulations or governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on the way we conduct our business 

  

the cftc has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with its rules and regulations we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations we also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the cftc or other agencies 

  

demutualization and utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations will among other developments impact our ability to continue the traditional forms of “selfregulation” that have been an integral part of the cftc regulatory program the cftc is reviewing that impact and it is unclear at this time whether the cftc will make modifications to its regulations that will have an adverse effect on the way we conduct our business 

  

from time to time it is proposed in congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated including a possible merger between the cftc and the sec while those proposals have not been adopted to date the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely to the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us our business could be negatively affected 

  

from time to time the president’s budget includes a proposal that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions while those proposals have not been adopted to date except for a percontract fee imposed under the securities exchange act of 1934 on single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes revenues and profits 

  

our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

  

generally the cftc has broad enforcement powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance audit and reporting systems as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extensive examination and surveillance activity in the case of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits including by customers for damages which can be significant any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results in extreme cases these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 

  

our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated management of operational legal and regulatory risk requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed 

  

as a financial services provider we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability 

  

many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks while we enjoy governmental immunity for some of our marketrelated activities we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the cftc these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we may become subject to these claims as the result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit in addition an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we could be harmed by employee misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter 

  

there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years misconduct by our employees including employees of gfx corporation our wholly owned subsidiary that engages in proprietary trading in foreign exchange and eurodollar futures could include hiding unauthorized activities from us improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information employee misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our employees also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence or otherwise as well as regulatory actions 

  

our acquisition investment and alliance strategy involves risks if we are unable to effectively manage these risks our business will be materially harmed 

  

to achieve our strategic objectives in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies businesses or technologies acquisitions entail numerous risks including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we may not be able to integrate successfully any operations personnel services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future 

  

we also may seek to expand or enhance some of our operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest and potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners for example in 2001 we entered into an operating agreement governing onechicago our joint venture with cboe and cbot to trade single stock futures and futures based on narrowbased stock indexes under the terms of our operating agreement we own approximately a 40 interest in the joint venture cboe owns approximately a 40 interest and cbot and management of onechicago each own a minority interest our ability to control key decisions relating to the operation and development of onechicago will be limited in addition under the terms of our operating agreement until may 31 2005 we are restricted from in any way engaging in the business of trading marketing regulating selling purchasing clearing or settling transactions in single stock futures other than in conjunction with the joint venture this restriction on our ability to compete applies whether or not we remain part of the joint venture but it does not apply to futures based on narrowbased stock indexes in 2002 we entered into an agreement with nymex to introduce eminy energy futures contracts which trade on our globex electronic trading platform and clear at the nymex clearing house during the term of the agreement and for one year thereafter we are generally prohibited other than in cooperation with nymex from providing for or facilitating electronic trading in futures or options on futures contracts on any underlying commodity or index of commodities that is also the underlying commodity for a product listed for trading by nymex we cannot assure you that any joint venture or alliance that we have entered into or may enter into in the future will be successful 

  

our ability to successfully trade single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes may be impaired by statutory and regulatory provisions that limit our natural competitive advantages and expand opportunities for competitors 

  

the commodity futures modernization act which authorized us to trade futures contracts based on individual securities and narrowbased stock indexes or security futures prohibited the implementation in connection with these contracts of many traditional features of futures trading that would have made using security futures cheaper tax advantaged and more efficient than using similar security options and otc security derivatives the commodity futures modernization act also created a system of dual registration and regulation for security futures intermediaries and exchanges that may be costly and burdensome to the intermediaries and the exchanges and may discourage intermediaries and investors from using security futures the commodity futures modernization act also eliminated most legal impediments to unregulated trading of security futures or similar products between qualified investors in addition foreign exchanges may be allowed to trade similar products under terms that will be more favorable than the terms we are permitted to offer our customers finally security futures are subject to a number of complicated and controversial regulations as a result we cannot assure you that we either directly or through our joint venture onechicago will be successful in offering single stock futures or futures on narrowbased stock indexes 

  

the imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at or otherwise offset by a fungible position existing at another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business 

  

in connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrowbased stock indexes the commodity futures modernization act contemplates that clearing houses will after an initial period establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house if in the future a similar 

  

requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 

  

expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet which could adversely affect our financial results 

  

we plan to continue to expand our operations internationally including by directly placing order entry terminals with members andor customers outside the united states and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners we face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business these risks include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition we will be required to comply with the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities of each country in which we conduct business these may include laws rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business to date we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets we may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of among other things competitive conditions overseas management of foreign exchange risk established domestic markets language and cultural differences and economic or political instability any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and consequently on our business financial condition and operating results 

  

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights which may materially harm our business 

  

we rely primarily on trade secret copyright service mark trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights we have filed several patent applications covering our technology in the united states and certain other jurisdictions notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights we also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law we have copyright registrations for certain of our software user manuals and databases the copyright protection afforded to databases however is fairly limited while the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable the actual data may not be and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function in some cases including a number of our most important products there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors in addition in the future we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity any such litigation whether successful or unsuccessful could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources either of which could adversely affect our business 

  

any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide or increase the cost of providing electronic execution services 

  

patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain and may be expected to obtain in the future patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer we cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services in addition some patent applications in the united states are confidential until a patent is issued and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be 

  

covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications in general if one or more of our products or services were to infringe patents held by others we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others whether such licenses would be available or if available whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms if we were unable to obtain such licenses we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

  

we only recently began operating as a forprofit company and have a limited operating history as a forprofit company accordingly our historical and recent financial and business results may not be representative of what they may be in the future  

  

we have only operated as a forprofit company with private ownership interests since november 13 2000 we have a limited operating history as a forprofit business on which you can evaluate our management decisions business strategy and financial results as a result our historical and recent financial and business results may not be representative of what they may be in the future we are subject to risks uncertainties expenses and difficulties associated with changing and implementing our business strategy that are not typically encountered by established forprofit companies the major us futures exchanges have operated historically as mutual membership organizations there is little history or experience in operating an exchange as a forprofit corporation upon which we can draw as a notforprofit company our business strategy and fee structure were designed to provide profit opportunities for our members we targeted profit levels that provided sufficient levels of working capital today our forprofit initiatives are designed to increase our revenues make us profitable optimize volume and liquidity and create operating efficiencies these initiatives may not yield the benefits or efficiencies we expect for example fee increases volume and member discounts and new access rules to our markets may not separately result in higher revenues and profits or greater volume or liquidity in our markets as a result we may not be able to operate effectively as a forprofit corporation it is possible that we may incur significant operating losses in the future and that we may not be able to achieve or sustain longterm profitability 

  

as a holding company we are totally dependent on dividends from our operating subsidiary to pay dividends and other obligations 

  

we are a holding company with no business operations our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiary as a result we must rely on payments from our subsidiary to meet our obligations in 2003 we paid regular quarterly dividends of 014 014 014 and 021 per share to our class a and class b shareholders as of september 3 2003 our annual dividend target was increased from 20 of the prior year’s cash earnings to 30 of the prior year’s cash earnings on february 5 2004 we declared a quarterly dividend of 026 per share to the class a and class b shareholders we currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiary will primarily be retained and used by it in its operations including servicing any debt obligations it may have now or in the future accordingly our subsidiary may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend or distribute funds to us in order to allow us to pay a dividend on or make a distribution in respect of our class a common stock our existing credit facility as well as future credit facilities other future debt obligations and statutory provisions may limit our ability to pay dividends

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we are not a party to or to our knowledge threatened with any litigation or other legal proceeding that in our opinion could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

  

on october 14 2003 the us futures exchange llc and us exchange holdings inc filed suit against cbot and cme in the united states district court for the district of columbia the suit alleges that cbot and cme violated the antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with the business relationship and contract between eurex us and the clearing corporation the us futures exchange llc and us exchange holdings inc are seeking a preliminary injunction and treble damages on december 12 2003 cbot and cme filed separate motions to dismiss or in the event the motion to dismiss is denied to move the venue to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois we believe this suit lacks factual or legal foundation and we intend to vigorously defend against these charges 

  

in november 2002 a former employee filed a complaint against cme in the circuit court of cook county illinois case no 02l014905 which was subsequently amended to allege common law claims of retaliatory discharge cme moved to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim which motion is awaiting ruling by the court this individual is seeking damages in excess of 3 million in this action cme has asserted three counterclaims against the former employee for breach of fiduciary duty unlawful destruction of personal property and conversion in june 2003 the former employee filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois alleging that his employment was terminated because of his race in violation of title vii and that his employment termination violated section 1981 which prohibits discrimination in making and enforcing contracts in this matter the individual seeks reinstatement back pay and benefits punitive damages in the amount of 2 million plus actual damages to be determined at trial cme has asserted the same three counterclaims alleged in the state action in the federal action discovery in these matters is ongoing based on its investigation to date and advice from legal counsel we believe these claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously
