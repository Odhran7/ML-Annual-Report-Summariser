client type and product type

component changes in aum by client type and product type for 2021 are presented below 

 





longterm product offerings include alphaseeking active and index strategies our alphaseeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction in contrast index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index index strategies include both our nonetf index products and etfs 

although many clients use both alphaseeking active and index strategies the application of these strategies may differ for example clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns in addition institutional nonetf index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and typically reflect low fee rates net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

equity 

yearend 2021 equity aum totaled 53 trillion reflecting net inflows of 1017 billion net inflows included 2229 billion and 488 billion into etfs and active respectively partially offset by nonetf index net outflows of 1700 billion record active equity net inflows were driven by flows into us growth technology and global fundamental equities franchises as well as flows into quantitative strategies

blackrock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix approximately half of blackrock’s equity aum is tied to international markets including emerging markets which tend to have higher fee rates than us equity strategies accordingly fluctuations in international equity markets which may not consistently move in tandem with us markets have a greater impact on blackrock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate 

equity represented 58 of longterm aum and 54 of longterm base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021

fixed income 

fixed income aum ended 2021 at 28 trillion reflecting net inflows of 2303 billion net inflows included 940 billion 789 billion and 574 billion in active etfs and nonetf index respectively record active fixed income net inflows of 940 billion reflected the funding of a significant core fixed income mandate in the fourth quarter as well as strong flows into unconstrained municipal total return and asia bond offerings

alternatives 

blackrock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing highalpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing our alternatives products fall into three main categories — 1 illiquid alternatives 2 liquid alternatives and 3 currency and commodities illiquid alternatives include offerings in alternative solutions private equity opportunistic and credit real estate and infrastructure liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions funds of funds

 

in 2021 liquid and illiquid alternatives generated a combined 274 billion of net inflows or 366 billion excluding return of capitalinvestment of 92 billion the largest contributors to return of capitalinvestment were opportunistic and credit strategies private equity solutions and infrastructure net inflows were driven by direct hedge funds private equity infrastructure and opportunistic and credit strategies at yearend blackrock had approximately 36 billion of nonfee paying unfunded uninvested commitments which are expected to be deployed in future years these commitments are not included in aum or flows until they are feepaying currency and commodities saw 16 billion of net inflows primarily into commodities etfs

taxation

blackrock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus tax authorities in the us legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax “ftt” on stocks bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions in the eu certain member states have also enacted similar ftts and the european commission “ec” has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of eulevel legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states if enacted as proposed ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s financial results and clients’ performance results

regulation of swaps and derivatives 

jurisdictions outside the us in which blackrock operates have adopted and implemented or are in the process of considering adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could further impact blackrock and the broader markets for example various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require blackrock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject these rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods reporting transactions to central data repositories mandating certain documentation standards requiring the posting and collection of initial andor variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed andor overthecounter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements

in the us certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to central clearing and trading venue execution requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 doddfrank with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future in the eu central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of blackrock funds and accounts on march 1 2017 most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared including nondeliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions became subject to requirements in the us eu and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect marktomarket margin payments for certain blackrock funds and accounts initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such marktomarket margin payments these rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading noncleared derivatives for blackrocks clients and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase blackrock’s operational and legal risks

 item 1a risk factors

as a global investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks while blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify measure monitor manage and analyze market operating legal compliance reputational fiduciary and investment risks blackrock’s business financial condition operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties including the ones discussed below

market and competition risks 

changes in the value levels of equity debt real assets commodities foreign exchange or other asset markets as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs may cause assets under management “aum” revenue and earnings to decline

blackrock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client numerous factors including price movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or other alternative investments in which blackrock invests as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs could cause











these risks may also be heightened by market volatility illiquid market conditions or other market disruptions the occurrence of any of the above events may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

changes in interest or foreign exchange rates andor divergent beta may cause blackrock’s aum and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the company’s net income and operating cash flows

in recent years there have been prolonged periods of historically low interest rates interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates blackrock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates similarly due to the global nature of blackrock’s operations a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar any failure by blackrock to manage movements in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar or its exposure to interest rates may cause blackrock’s aum to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the company’s base fees net income and operating cash flows

in addition beta divergence between equity markets where certain markets perform differently than others may lead to an increase in the proportion of blackrock aum weighted toward lower fee equity products resulting in a decline in blackrock’s effective fee rate divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of aum and base fees

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services the advisory or management contracts blackrock has entered into with its clients including the agreements that govern many of blackrock’s investment funds provide investors or in some cases the independent directors of applicable investment funds with significant latitude to terminate such contracts withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty or to remove blackrock as a fund’s investment advisor or equivalent blackrock also manages its us mutual funds closedend and exchangetraded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors a majority of whom are independent from the company blackrock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors in addition if a number of blackrock’s clients terminate their contracts or otherwise remove blackrock from its advisory roles liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on similar terms the fees or carried interest blackrock earns could be reduced which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause aum in similar blackrock products to decline irrespective of blackrock’s performance

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by blackrock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar blackrock products irrespective of the performance of such products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

increased competition may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

the investment management industry is highly competitive and blackrock competes based on a number of factors including investment performance liquidity its technology and portfolio construction offerings the level of fees charged the quality and breadth of services and products provided name recognition and reputation and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors in addition over the past several years there has been significant consolidation in the asset management and financial services industries as investors increasingly seek out firms that have the capacity to deliver broad multiasset investment capabilities and technological expertise including in a manner that is responsive to ever more localized needs this consolidation together with the introduction of new technologies as well as regulatory changes continues to alter the competitive landscape for investment managers which may lead to additional fee compression or require blackrock to invest more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with the products services and geographic diversity offered by other financial institutions technology companies trading advisory or asset management firms increased competition on the basis of any of these factors including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

 

failure to maintain aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the sophisticated risk analytics portfolio management trade execution and investment operations that blackrock provides via its   technology platform to support investment advisory and aladdin clients are important elements of blackrock’s competitive success aladdin ’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management trading and operations tools on a single platform increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions whether due to price competition perceived client market share platform flexibility or marketbased or regulatory factors may weaken aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the company’s revenue and earnings to decline in addition to the extent that aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than blackrock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings blackrock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share which may impede its productivity and growth moreover although blackrock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in aladdin

blackrock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose blackrock to reputational harm additional costs or operational risk  

blackrock’s financial performance depends in part on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry respond to evolving client demands and develop market and manage new investment products and services conversely the development and introduction of new products and services including the creation of products with concentrations in industries or sectors specific to individual client criteria or with a focus on esg matters requires continued innovative effort on the part of blackrock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services constraints on our ability to manage growth within client mandates compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements and intellectual propertyrelated lawsuits or claims a growing number of new products and services also depend on data provided by third parties as analytical inputs and are subject to additional risks including with respect to data quality cost availability and provider relationships data sets for certain developing analytics such as those in the sustainability space are evolving and difficulties approximating gaps in data or sourcing data from reliable sources could adversely impact the accuracy and effectiveness of such tools there can be no assurance that blackrock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timescale they require any failure to successfully develop new products and services or effectively manage associated operational risks could harm blackrock’s reputation and expose the company to additional costs which may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline

changes in the value of seed and coinvestments that blackrock owns as well as certain of blackrock’s minority investments could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings

at december 31 2021 blackrock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately 37 billion in its investments see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsinvestments  primarily resulted from coinvestments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or other alternative investments could lower the value of these investments as well as certain minority investments increase the volatility of blackrock’s earnings and cause earnings to decline

blackrock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default

blackrock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients in the event of a borrower default blackrock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan blackrock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered where the collateral is in the form of cash the indemnities blackrock provides do not guarantee assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested the amount of securities on loan as of december 31 2021 and subject to this type of indemnification was 286 billion in the company’s capacity as lending agent cash and securities totaling 304 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31 2021 significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged andor increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the company’s revenue and earnings to decline

blackrock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time or the inability to provide support may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline

while not legally mandated blackrock may at its option from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons any decision by blackrock to support products may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes blackrock’s ability to support certain products may be restricted by regulation or by the company’s failure to have or make available sufficient capital or liquidity moreover inherent constraints arising from the business models of certain asset managers including blackrock may during periods of market volatility result in blackrock having fewer options for accessing liquidity than asset managers with alternate business models which may adversely impact its ability to support certain products any decision by blackrock to support particular products or the inability to provide such support may result in losses which may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline

 

 

 

 

increased geopolitical unrest and other events outside of blackrock’s control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international regional and domestic markets which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

geopolitical risks including those arising from trade tension andor the imposition of trade tariffs terrorist activity or acts of civil or international hostility are increasing for instance military conflict and escalating tensions between russia and ukraine could result in geopolitical instability and adversely affect the global economy or specific markets strategic competition between the us and china and resulting tensions have also contributed to uncertainty in the geopolitical and regulatory landscapes similarly other events outside of blackrock’s control including natural disasters climate changerelated events pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions that may increase international tension any such events and responses including regulatory developments may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors disruptions to commerce including to economic activity travel and supply chains loss of life and property damage and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets as well as the company’s products operations clients vendors and employees which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline blackrock’s exposure to geopolitical risks may be heightened to the extent such risks arise in countries in which blackrock currently operates or is seeking to expand its presence

climate changerelated risks could adversely affect blackrock’s business products operations and clients which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s business and those of its clients could be impacted by climate changerelated risks climate change may present risk to blackrock through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a lowercarbon economy climaterelated physical risks arise from the direct impacts of a changing climate in the short and longterm such risks may include the risks of extreme weather events and changes in temperature which may damage infrastructure and facilities including blackrock’s physical assets as well as disrupt connectivity or supply chains climaterelated transition risks arise from exposure to the transition to a lowercarbon economy through policy regulatory technology and market changes for instance new regulations or guidance relating to climate change as well as the perspectives of stakeholders regarding climate change may affect blackrock’s business activities and reputation and increase disclosure requirements which could increase the company’s costs 

climaterelated physical and transition risks could impact blackrock both directly and indirectly through adverse impacts to its clients including as a result of declines in asset values changes in client preferences increased regulatory and compliance costs and significant business disruptions any of these risks may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

risks related to investment performance

poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline

the company’s management believes that investment performance including the efficient delivery of beta is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of aum poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline as a result of













performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings

a portion of blackrock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments performance fees represented 11 billion or 6 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 generally the company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded a performance fee for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods the volatility of the company’s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the company’s performance fee generating assets in particular as blackrock manages more illiquid products performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multiyear periods than those associated with more liquid products

failure to identify errors in the quantitative models blackrock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships

blackrock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes including those related to risk assessment esg considerations portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations any errors or limitations in the underlying models model inputs or assumptions as well as any failure of blackrock’s governance approval testing and validation standards in respect of such models model inputs or assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse effects on blackrock’s business and reputation

risks related to the covid19 pandemic

the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect blackrock’s business operations and financial condition which may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline

the covid19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and may adversely affect blackrock’s business including its operations and financial condition and may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline the covid19 pandemic continues to result in governmental authorities taking numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of covid19 such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and limitations on business activity including closures these measures may continue to among other things severely restrict global economic activity which can disrupt supply chains lower asset valuations significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets

 

towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact blackrock’s business while global markets have significantly recovered since then the effects of the pandemic are ongoing and could be prolonged or worsen and have an ongoing adverse impact on blackrock’s business including its operations and financial condition as a result of among other things 

















the aggregate extent to which covid19 and the related impact on the global economy affect blackrock’s business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period the emergence and spread of variants of the covid19 virus the continuing prevalence of severe unconstrained andor escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions the availability adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines future actions taken by governmental authorities central banks and other third parties including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform in response to the pandemic and the effects of the covid19 pandemic on blackrock’s products clients vendors and employees and may exacerbate the other risks described herein 

technology and operational risks

a failure in or disruption to blackrock’s operations systems or infrastructure including business continuity plans could adversely affect operations damage the company’s reputation and cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

blackrock’s infrastructure including its technological capacity data centers and office space is vital to the competitiveness of its business moreover a significant portion of blackrock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas including san francisco new york london budapest atlanta and gurgaon the failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of blackrock’s business or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside blackrock’s control including a major earthquake hurricane fire terrorist act pandemic such as the covid19 pandemic health crisis or other catastrophic event or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt blackrock’s operations in any location at which blackrock maintains a major presence could materially impact operations result in disruption to the business or impede its growth in addition these risks and risks related to supply chain and labor constraints could adversely impact blackrock’s move to its new headquarters in new york which is currently expected to begin in late 2022 

despite blackrock’s efforts to ensure business continuity if it fails to keep business continuity plans uptodate or if such plans including secure backup facilities and systems and the availability of backup employees are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption the company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline or impact the company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations or contractual obligations leading to reputational harm legal liability regulatory fines andor sanctions

a cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them including data provided by third parties that is significant to portions of its business and products an externally caused information security incident such as a cyberattack including a phishing scam business email compromise malware or denialofservice or ransomware attack or an internally caused incident or disruption such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information moreover developments in blackrock’s use of process automation as well as the increased use of remote access by employees and mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex unpredictable or beyond blackrock’s control blackrock’s growing exposure to the public internet as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyberattacks could disrupt blackrock’s operations and result in misappropriation corruption or loss of personal confidential or proprietary information or thirdparty data in addition there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available

 

the financial services industry has been the subject of cyberattacks involving the dissemination theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties including nation state actors and terrorist organizations blackrock has been the target of attempted cyberattacks as well as the coopting of its brand and must monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption as the failure to do so could disrupt blackrock’s operations and cause financial losses although blackrock has implemented policies and controls and takes protective measures involving significant expense to prevent and address potential data breaches inadvertent disclosures increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks and cyberrelated fraud there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective  in addition a successful cyberattack may persist for an extended period of time before being detected and it may take a considerable amount of time for an investigation to be completed and the severity and potential impact to be known moreover due to the complexity and interconnectedness of blackrock’s systems the process of upgrading or patching the company’s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the company as well as for clients who rely upon or have exposure to blackrock’s systems 

in addition due to blackrock’s interconnectivity with thirdparty vendors advisors central agents exchanges clearing houses and other financial institutions blackrock or any such third party may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyberattack or other information security event including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a thirdparty cloud environment blackrock also routinely transmits and receives personal confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means the company collaborates with clients vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyberattacks however blackrock or such third parties may not have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information

any information security incident or cyberattack against blackrock or third parties with whom it is connected including any interception mishandling or misuse of personal confidential or proprietary information could result in material financial loss loss of competitive position regulatory fines andor sanctions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline in addition blackrock’s cybersecurity insurance may not cover all losses and damages from such events and blackrock’s ability to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future may be limited

failure or unavailability of thirdparty dependencies may adversely affect aladdin operations which could cause reputational harm lead to a loss of clients and impede blackrock’s productivity and growth

blackrock must maintain effective infrastructure including a robust and secure technological framework in order to maximize the benefit of the aladdin platform in so doing it relies in part on certain thirdparty service providers for example aladdin ’s data architecture depends on thirdparty providers of technology solutions including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to aladdin ’s growth in addition the analytical capabilities of aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into aladdin ’s analytical calculations although blackrock has implemented internal controls and procedures and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the aladdin   platform there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with aladdin ’s size and growth or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities could compromise aladdin ’s resilience result in operational difficulties cause reputational harm and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and aladdin clients

continuing enhancements to aladdin’s capabilities as well as the expansion of the aladdin platform into new markets and geographies have led to significant growth in aladdin’s processing scale which may expose blackrock to reputational harm increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational data management cyber and informationsecurity risks

the operation of blackrock’s aladdin   platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities configuration change management developing testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements these updates and expansion initiatives which have led to significant growth in aladdin ’s processing scale frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose blackrock to additional cyber and informationsecurity risks as well as increased execution operational and data management risks if blackrock is unable to manage the pace of or provide the operational resiliency and stability for the expansion of aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale blackrock may experience client attrition reduced business increased costs reputational harm or regulatory fines andor sanctions which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

in addition the highly regulated business activities of many aladdin clients may expose blackrock to heightened regulatory scrutiny for example the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which aladdin clients are based has required blackrock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client’s home location operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose blackrock to increased operational complexity as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions

failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause blackrock’s aum liquidity and earnings to decline as well as harm its prospects for growth

blackrock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows in addition while blackrock inc is not subject to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards which require them to maintain certain levels of capital and liquidity failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force blackrock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives blackrock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt or secure lines of credit or commercial paper backup lines on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions a reduction in its long or shortterm credit ratings or changes in government regulations including tax and interest rates failure to obtain funds andor financing or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds andor financing may cause blackrock’s aum liquidity and earnings to decline curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth

operating risks associated with blackrock’s securities lending program may result in client losses

blackrock lends securities to banks and brokerdealers on behalf of certain of its clients in these securities lending transactions the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral blackrock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks the failure of blackrock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs separate from the risks of collateral investments and blackrock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks

 

inorganic transactions may harm the company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful 

blackrock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings increase product offerings deliver wholeportfolio solutions access new clients leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies inorganic strategies have included hiring smallersized investment teams making minority investments in early to midstage technological and other ventures entering into strategic joint ventures and acquiring investment management and technology businesses analytics models and other intellectual property inorganic transactions involve a number of financial accounting tax regulatory geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties including in some cases the assumption of preexisting liabilities which must be managed in order for blackrock to realize the benefit of such transactions and such transactions may be the subject of unanticipated liabilities arising from commercial disputes information security vulnerabilities or breaches and intellectual property or other legal claims the success of blackrock’s inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce operations strategies technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition blackrock may be required to commit significant management time as well as create new or grow existing operational and support functions to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture there can be no assurance that blackrock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses retain associated talent scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy moreover the challenges associated with blackrock’s inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations involve new markets products or business lines or are delivered via technology and systems that differ from that employed by blackrock in addition in the case of minority investments and joint ventures blackrock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm liability or loss resulting from or relating to operating systems risk management controls and employees that are outside of blackrock’s control any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence governance or oversight rights indemnification provisions andor operational expertise or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation or cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline which may harm the company’s competitive position in the investment management industry

client investments in real assets such as real estate infrastructure and energy assets may expose blackrock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities as well as reputational harm

blackrock makes investments on behalf of its clients in real assets including real estate infrastructure and energy assets that may expose blackrock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets these may include























the above risks may expose blackrock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities including costs associated with delays or remediation costs and increased legal or regulatory costs all of which could impact the returns earned by blackrock’s clients these risks could also result in direct liability for blackrock by exposing blackrock to losses regulatory sanction or litigation including claims for compensatory or punitive damages similarly market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which blackrock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of blackrock’s clients the occurrence of any such events may expose blackrock to reputational harm divert management’s attention away from blackrock’s other business activities or cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline

operating in international markets increases blackrock’s operational political regulatory and other risks

as a result of blackrock’s extensive international operations the company faces associated operational regulatory reputational political and foreign exchange rate risks many of which are outside of the company’s control operating outside the us may also expose blackrock to increased compliance risks as well as higher compliance costs to comply with us and nonus anticorruption antimoney laundering and sanctions laws and regulations similarly certain jurisdictions in which blackrock operates may not have comparable levels of protection for corporate assets such as intellectual property and client information and records as the us as a result there may also be heightened information security or privacy risks in those jurisdictions any theft of data technology or intellectual property may negatively impact blackrock’s business operations and reputation the failure of the company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines andor sanctions which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

 

risks related to human capital 

the potential for human error in connection with blackrock’s operational systems could disrupt operations cause losses lead to regulatory fines or damage the company’s reputation and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

many of blackrock’s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the company’s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies although blackrock expends considerable resources on systemic controls supervision technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients counterparties or the company blackrock’s operations are dependent on its employees from timetotime employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems controls policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors these can include calculation errors errors in software implementation or development failure to ensure data security follow processes patch systems or report issues or errors in judgment such risks may be exacerbated in times of increased market volatility human errors even if promptly discovered and remediated may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines andor sanctions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

fraud the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

blackrock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks notwithstanding these measures blackrock cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks and blackrock employees have in the past engaged in improper conduct in addition blackrock is subject to the risk that its employees contractors or other third parties may in the future deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the company’s controls policies procedures workplace culture or principles this risk may be heightened as blackrock expands into new markets increases the breadth of its business offerings and provides remote and alternative work models all of which introduce additional complexity to its risk management program persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation cause adverse publicity and result in litigation regulatory inquiries fines andor sanctions which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

the failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline

blackrock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the company’s ability to plan for the future longterm growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within blackrock the global market for qualified fund managers investment analysts technology and risk specialists and other professionals is highly competitive and factors that affect blackrock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the company’s reputation and workplace culture the immigration and public health policies in the jurisdictions in which blackrock has offices its approach to remote and alternative work models  the compensation and benefits it provides and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession including the development and training of qualified individuals

in addition a percentage of the deferred compensation that blackrock pays to its employees is tied to the company’s share price as such if blackrock’s share price were to decrease the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession if blackrock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession the company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted

risks related to key thirdparty relationships

the impairment or failure of third parties may negatively impact the performance of products and accounts that blackrock manages which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

blackrock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages for its clients to many different industries and counterparties including distributors brokers and dealers commercial and investment banks clearing organizations mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients transactions with counterparties expose blackrock’s clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults although blackrock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may fail to meet their obligations counterparties may also experience lapses in their internal controls or risk management systems or expose blackrock andor its clients to losses on account of employee malfeasance negligence or human error in addition the concentration of certain financial institutions that blackrock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients including clearing organizations exchanges and central agents increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at or default by one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays impacting multiple blackrock clients any such operational issue impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts that blackrock manages for its clients which may lead to client attrition and in turn cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

the failure of key thirdparty providers to blackrock to fulfill their obligations or a failure by blackrock to maintain its relationships with key thirdparty providers could have a material adverse effect on blackrock’s growth reputation or business which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

blackrock depends on a number of key thirdparty providers for various fund administration accounting custody market and esg data market indices insurance technology and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs blackrock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of thirdparty index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients’ investment decisions the index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of longterm contracts remains the market standard this industry structure may limit blackrock’s ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all while blackrock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered there may be few or no alternative vendors available in addition blackrock’s operations and processes rely on commercially available data provided by third parties as well as providers of services including technology services and operating errors process failures or failures to comply with data usage requirements with respect to these service providers may adversely impact blackrock data providers commonly disclaim the accuracy and completeness of data and blackrock does not have the ability to validate or verify the accuracy and completeness of commercially sourced datasets moreover in situations where blackrock has limited access to alternative vendors or where the nature of blackrock’s arrangement with a vendor requires a long termcommitment blackrock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services 

 

blackrock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one thirdparty provider to another key contract transfers may be costly and complex and expose blackrock to heightened operational risks any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm as well as financial losses to blackrock and its clients the failure or inability of blackrock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key thirdparty provider to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients’ investment management or other agreements have an adverse financial impact on blackrock products or lead to operational legal and regulatory issues for the company which could result in reputational harm or legal liability fines andor sanctions and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

any disruption to the company’s distribution channels may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

blackrock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution portfolio administration and servicing for certain blackrock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels blackrock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the company’s future performance and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs andor reductions in the amount of blackrock products and services being marketed or distributed moreover new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors business models and more limited product offerings potentially resulting in reduced distribution andor marketing of certain of the company’s products and services and fee compression if blackrock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings may decline in addition improper activities as well as inadequate antimoney laundering diligence conducted by thirdparty distributors could create reputational and regulatory harm to blackrock

key technology partnerships may expose blackrock to increased regulatory oversight as well as migration execution technology and operational risks

in april 2020 blackrock announced a strategic partnership to host aladdin infrastructure on the microsoft azure cloud and commenced a multiyear plan to migrate the aladdin environments for blackrock and its external aladdin clients to the cloud the benefits of a cloudbased platform are significant and blackrock has adopted a robust riskbased approach to its migration strategy however the partnership also introduces new risks including i risks associated with relying on a thirdparty for aspects of the reliability and stability of aladdin’s infrastructure ii software and information security risks arising from the use of cloud technology iii operational and execution risks including those related to migration and iv risks related to increased regulatory oversight and new compliance obligations which risks may be further exacerbated as the aladdin platform continues to grow any failure by blackrock to manage these risks andor risks associated with future potential technology partnerships may result in escalating costs financial loss client dissatisfaction or attrition regulatory fines andor sanctions reputational harm or legal liability which in turn may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to blackrock’s exchangetraded fund “etf” platform may adversely affect the prices at which etfs trade particularly during periods of market volatility

blackrock is the largest provider of etfs globally shares of etfs trade on stock exchanges at prices at above or below the etf’s most recent net asset value “nav” the nav of an etf is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the etf’s holdings the trading price of the etf’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours the creationredemption feature and arbitrage mechanism of an etf are designed to make it more likely that the etf’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the nav notwithstanding these features exchange prices have in the past deviated measurably from the nav of certain etfs and may under certain circumstances do so in the future etf market prices are subject to numerous potential risks including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange and the inability or unwillingness of market makers authorized participants settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an etf’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively these risks may be heightened as a result of significant market volatility the accelerating growth of the etf industry combined with increased market activity as well as the complexity associated with the growing demand for product customization although certain structural improvements have contributed to the increasing resilience stability and transparency of etf markets including during periods of volatility and despite blackrock’s continuing work with regulators and other third parties to implement additional etf reforms there can be no assurance that any such reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion or at all moreover if market events lead to incidences where etfs trade at prices that deviate meaningfully from an etf’s nav or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market investors may lose confidence in etf products and redeem their holdings which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters such as the financial stability board “fsb” international organization of securities commissions “iosco” and bank for international settlements may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which blackrock operates most recently such workstreams have focused on areas such as products and activities of nonbank financial institutions money market funds openended funds “oefs” central counterparty margin practices and enhanced esg disclosures blackrock is and may become subject to increasing regulation in these areas see item 1 business – regulation  including

legal proceedings may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

blackrock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the company certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with blackrock’s activities certain of blackrock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities including the securities and exchange commission office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” department of labor commodity futures trading commission financial conduct authority commission de surveillance du secteur financial and federal reserve similarly from time to time blackrock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various us and nonus governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industrywide companyspecific or other investigations proceedings or litigations these examinations inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future if compliance failures or other violations are found cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings andor impose sanctions for violations any such action may also result in litigation by investors in blackrock’s funds other blackrock clients or blackrock’s shareholders which could harm the company’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the company being liable for damages

in addition when clients retain blackrock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that blackrock must observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose blackrock to lawsuits harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts

damage to blackrock’s reputation may harm its business

blackrock’s reputation is critical to its relationships with its clients employees shareholders and business partners blackrock’s reputation may be harmed by among other factors regulatory or enforcement actions technology or operational failures poor investment performance ineffective management or monitoring of key thirdparty relationships ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents privacy incidents employee errors or misconduct a failure to manage esg risks or a failure to manage conflicts of interest in addition blackrock’s business scale and investments subject it to significant media coverage and increasing attention from a broad range of stakeholders this heightened scrutiny has resulted in negative publicity for blackrock and may continue to do so in the future for example different stakeholder groups have divergent views on esg matters including in the countries in which blackrock operates and invests as well as states and localities where blackrock serves public sector clients this divergence increases the risk that any action or lack thereof on esg will be perceived negatively by at least some stakeholders and adversely impact blackrock’s reputation and business blackrock’s global presence and investments on behalf of its clients around the world could also lead to heightened scrutiny and criticism in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape for example blackrock has received criticism from some stakeholders because of its investments in certain countries including china on behalf of clients these criticisms have the potential to adversely impact blackrock’s reputation and business in addition the increasing popularity of social media and nonmainstream internet news sources may lead to faster and wider dissemination of any adverse publicity or inaccurate information about blackrock making effective remediation more difficult damage to blackrock’s reputation may impact blackrock’s ability to attract and retain clients employees shareholders and business partners which may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline

a failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest could result in litigation or enforcement actions andor adversely affect blackrock’s business and reputation which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

as a global investment management firm that provides investment and technology services to a diverse range of clients the company must routinely address and manage conflicts of interest as well as the perception of conflicts of interest between itself and its clients employees or vendors while blackrock has policies controls and disclosure protocols in place to manage and address potential conflicts of interest identifying and mitigating conflicts of interest can be complex and is the subject of increasing regulatory and media scrutiny it is possible that actual potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor or client dissatisfaction adverse publicity litigation or enforcement actions in particular blackrock’s broad range of investment advisory and technology offerings and its focus on providing clients with whole portfolio solutions may result in clients working with multiple blackrock businesses andor blackrock being engaged by institutions that have a nexus to industries or jurisdictions in which blackrock operates which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing to the extent that blackrock fails or appears to fail to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest it may face adverse publicity reputational damage litigation regulatory proceedings client attrition penalties fines andor sanctions any of which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

a subsidiary of blackrock is subject to us banking regulations that may limit its business activities

blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary which is a national banking association chartered by the occ is subject to occ regulation and capital requirements that may limit its business activities the occ has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over blackrock’s trust bank having a subsidiary subject to banking regulation may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to such limitations

the implications of complying with threshold limits andor any failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to blackrock’s reputation impact the performance of certain blackrock funds and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline

of note among the various international regulations to which blackrock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels thresholds across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the company the specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions blackrock continues to invest in technology training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions despite these investments the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future any such errors may expose blackrock to monetary penalties or other sanctions which could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline

 

moreover as blackrock’s business grows it is becoming subject to a greater number of regulatory industrylevel or issuerspecific threshold limits that may prevent blackrock from holding positions in certain equity securities securities convertible into equity securities or futures contracts in excess of certain thresholds although blackrock is actively engaged in regulatory issuerspecific and structural initiatives to create additional investment capacity threshold limits may nonetheless prevent the purchase of certain securities which may in turn impact the performance of certain blackrock index funds by increasing tracking error relative to the funds’ benchmarks and impact the performance of certain blackrock actively managed funds by preventing them from taking advantage of alpha generating opportunities 

blackrock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the scale of our index investing business as well as competition issues relating to the common ownership theory

as a leader in the index investing and asset management industry blackrock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing commentators have argued that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows create stock price bubbles or conversely exacerbate a decline in market prices additional commentary focuses on the common ownership theory an academic theory stating that minority ownership of multiple companies within a single industry by the same investor leads to anticompetitive effects this theory purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain industries with higher consumer prices and executive compensation and lower wages and employment rates among other things in the us the ftc cited common ownership as a disqualifying factor in a proposed exemption from premerger notification rules and as a consideration underlying its consultation on rules applying to acquisitions of voting securities by investment entities in 2021 the ftc identified common ownership as a key enforcement area and passed a resolution empowering individual commissioners to investigate shareholder conduct in connection with common ownership it is expected that common ownership may be given greater consideration in ftc investigations studies rule proposals policy decisions andor the scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions the debate on common ownership is still on the agenda of competition regulators globally and it is expected that common ownership may continue to be a consideration for the ec among others including in the assessment of mergers and investigations for example ec and european parliament reports have suggested that more evidence was required on the impact of common ownership on competition and a committee of the australian house of representatives held an inquiry on the implications of common ownership and capital concentration on australian companies and markets there is substantial literature casting doubt on the assumptions data methodology and conclusions associated with the common ownership theory and competition regulators including the ftc have acknowledged that the debate around the theory remains unsettled nevertheless some commentators have proposed remedies including limits on the ownership stakes of common owners that if enacted into policy could have a negative impact on the capital markets as well as increase costs and limit the availability of products for investors such policy solutions could in turn adversely affect blackrock 

new tax legislation or changes to existing us and nonus tax laws treaties and regulations or challenges to blackrock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate business and overall financial condition

blackrock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus tax authorities in the us legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax “ftt” on stocks bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions in the eu certain member states have also enacted similar ftts and the ec has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of eulevel legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states if enacted as proposed ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s financial results and clients’ performance results 

the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock these challenges may result in adjustments to or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition similarly the company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by blackrock or to specific tax rules to the extent there are changes in tax law or policy or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by blackrock the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and blackrock may suffer financial or reputational harm

business outlook 

blackrock’s strategy continues to be guided by the companys purpose and focus on the longterm which the company believes better enables it to deliver durable returns for shareholders and create value for all of its stakeholders

blackrocks framework for longterm shareholder value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis blackrocks diversified platform in terms of style product client and geography enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles positioning blackrock to invest for the longterm by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management

blackrock continues to actively monitor covid19 developments and their potential impact on the company’s employees business and operations particularly in jurisdictions where blackrock has significant employee populations andor business activity the aggregate extent to which covid19 including existing and new variants and its related impact on the global economy affects blackrock’s business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period the emergence and spread of variants of the covid19 virus the continuing prevalence of severe unconstrained andor escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions and the availability adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines and future actions taken by governmental authorities central banks and other third parties in response to the pandemic see part i item 1a  risk factors herein for information on the possible future effects of the covid19 pandemic on the company’s results

in addition blackrock’s business may be impacted by governmental changes as well as potential regulations foreign and trade policies and fiscal spending that may arise as a result of such changes 

blackrock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of aum and in some cases performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client numerous factors including price movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests on behalf of clients and blackrock’s ability to maintain strong investment performance could impact blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings 

during 2021 blackrock voluntarily waived a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintained a minimum level of daily net investment income these waivers resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately 500 million in 2021 a portion of which was partially offset by a reduction of blackrock’s distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries blackrock has provided voluntary yield support waivers in prior periods and may increase or decrease the level of fee waivers in future periods given the current prospects for higher rates in the near term we anticipate most of these waivers would cease shortly after the first 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate however approximately 50 of these gross fee waivers are generally shared with distributors reducing the impact on operating income

in recent years there have been prolonged periods of historically low interest rates interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates blackrock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates changes in global interest rates may cause blackrock’s aum to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the company’s base fees net income and operating cash flows see part i item 1a  risk factors herein for information on the possible future effects of changes in global interest rates on the companys results

blackrock manages 28 trillion in fixed income assets twothirds of which are owned by institutions for strategic or liabilitymatching purposes blackrock believes it is well positioned for a rising rate environment due to the breadth diversification and performance of its fixed income platform which encompasses active etf and nonetf index fixed income products and a range of strategies including unconstrained high yield total return and shortduration

blackrock manages 53 trillion of equity assets across markets globally beta divergence between equity markets where certain markets perform differently than others may lead to an increase in the proportion of blackrock aum weighted toward lower fee equity products resulting in a decline in blackrock’s effective fee rate divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of aum and investment advisory and administration fees collectively “base fees” and securities lending revenue

nongaap financial measures

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” however management believes evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful for both management and investors in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance over time management also uses nongaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented nongaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock’s revenue and expense blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap nongaap measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

management uses both gaap and nongaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance adjustments to gaap financial measures “nongaap adjustments” include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow 

computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows 

1 operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted 

 



 

management believes operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time and therefore provide useful disclosure to investors management believes that operating margin as adjusted reflects the company’s longterm ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues the company uses operating margin as adjusted to assess the company’s financial performance and to determine the longterm and annual compensation of the company’s seniorlevel employees furthermore this metric is used to evaluate the company’s relative performance against industry peers as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates these estimates judgments and assumptions are affected by the company’s application of accounting policies management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements these policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments assumptions or estimates for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this filing

consolidation 

the company consolidates entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest the company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the vre or is a primary beneficiary “pb” of a vie assessing whether an entity is a vie or a vre involves judgment and analysis on a structurebystructure basis factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership the rights of equity investment holders the company’s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company’s involvement with the entity entities that are determined to be vres are consolidated if the company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which generally exists if there is greater than 50 voting interest entities that are determined to be vies are consolidated if the company is the pb of the entity blackrock is deemed to be the pb of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie there is judgment involved in assessing whether the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie in addition the company’s ownership interest in vies is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as ongoing redemptions and contributions the company generally consolidates vies in which it holds an economic interest of 10 or greater and deconsolidates such vies once equity ownership falls below 10 as of december 31 2021 the company was deemed to be the pb of 75 vies see note 6 consolidated sponsored investment products  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information 

fair value measurements 

the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument see note 2 significant accounting policies  and note 8 fair value disclosures  in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements 

changes in valuation changes in value on 5181 million of investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense 526 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 1555 million relates to carried interest which will not impact nonoperating income expense at december 31 2021 changes in fair value of 3119 million of cips will impact blackrock’s net income loss attributable to nci on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of cips was 1887 million 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary openend investment funds collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets the assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts primarily is based upon the following i the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these products ii the company expects to and has the ability to continue to operate these products indefinitely iii the products have multiple investors and are not reliant on a single investor or small group of investors for their continued operation iv current competitive factors and economic conditions do not indicate a finite life and v there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience in addition trade namestrademarks are considered indefinitelived intangibles if they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 

finitelived investorcustomer relationships technology related assets and management contracts which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the company for a specified period of time are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2021 ranged from 1 to 9 years with a weightedaverage remaining estimated useful life of approximately seven years 

goodwill the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment assessment performed as of july 31 2021 indicated no impairment charge was required the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2021 the company’s common stock closed at 91556 which exceeded its book value of 24850 per share 

 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired at least annually as of july 31st 

 

in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is less than carrying value blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates in addition the company considered other factors including i macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or other developments in equity and credit markets ii industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the company operates an increased competitive environment a decline in marketdependent multiples or metrics a change in the market for an entity’s services or regulatory legal or political developments and iii the companyspecific events such as a change in management or key personnel overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset if an indefinitelived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs

 

for finitelived intangible assets if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform a recoverability test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis  factors included in evaluating finitelived customer relationships technology related assets and trade names include technology services revenue trends customer attrition rates obsolescence rates and royalty rates for finitelived management contracts evaluation is based on changes in assumptions including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test the difference between the book value of the asset and its current estimated fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed and whether the indefinitelife and finitelife classifications are still appropriate a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 147 million 106 million and 97 million for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

in 2021 2020 and 2019 the company performed impairment tests including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments the company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinitelived versus finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

revenue recognition 

the company recognizes revenues when its obligations related to the services are satisfied and it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue amount would not occur in future periods the company enters into contracts that can include multiple services which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct management judgment is required in assessing the probability of significant revenue reversal and in identification of distinct services

the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the company fees are primarily based on agreedupon percentages of aum and recognized for services provided during the period which are distinct from services provided in other periods such fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows aum represents the broad range of financial assets the company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue for example net asset values

the company receives investment advisory performance fees including incentive allocations carried interest from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds which vary by product or account and include monthly quarterly annual or longer measurement periods

performance fees including carried interest are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold at the end of a specified measurement period given the unique nature of each fee arrangement contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition significant judgement is involved in making such determination performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods consequently a portion of the fees the company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period at each reporting date the company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized including carried interest these factors include but are not limited to whether 1 the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the company’s influence 2 the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts and 3 the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to a invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or b distribute their sales proceeds and the timing of such distributions 

the company is allocateddistributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds the company may be required to reversereturn all or part of such carried interest allocationsdistributions depending upon future performance of these products carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition 

the company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2021 and 2020 the company had 1508 million and 584 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition a portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense if any is unknown see note 17 revenue  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2021 and 2020

the company earns revenue for providing technology services determining the amount of revenue to recognize requires judgment and estimates complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounting for separately other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixedrate basis revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights

 

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and recognized when known and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until 1 performance thresholds have been exceeded and 2 management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information on revenue recognition including other revenue streams 

income taxes

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit 

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2021 blackrock had 1 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 616 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2021 the company had deferred income tax assets of 245 million and deferred income tax liabilities of 2758 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company 

the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard the assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives

client type and product type 

component changes in aum by client type and product type for 2020 are presented below 

 



 

longterm product offerings include alphaseeking active and index strategies our alphaseeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction in contrast index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index index strategies include both our nonetf index products and ishares etfs 

although many clients use both alphaseeking active and index strategies the application of these strategies may differ for example clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns in addition institutional nonetf index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and typically reflect low fee rates net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

equity 

yearend 2020 equity aum totaled 44 trillion reflecting net inflows of 490 billion net inflows included 763 billion and 302 billion into ishares etfs and active respectively partially offset by nonetf index net outflows of 575 billion record active equity net inflows were driven by flows into highperforming technology health sciences and us growth fundamental equities franchises as well as flows into quantitative strategies

blackrock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix approximately half of blackrock’s equity aum is tied to international markets including emerging markets which tend to have higher fee rates than us equity strategies accordingly fluctuations in international equity markets which may not consistently move in tandem with us markets have a greater impact on blackrock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate 

equity represented 55 of longterm aum and 50 of longterm base fees for 2020

fixed income aum ended 2020 at 27 trillion reflecting net inflows of 1580 billion ishares etfs net inflows of 890 billion were led by flows into us investment grade corporate core and high yield bond funds nonetf index net inflows of 421 billion were driven by demand for liabilitydriven investment solutions and index mutual funds active net inflows of 269 billion reflected strong flows in high yield asian total return and core bond offerings

alternatives 

blackrock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing highalpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing our alternatives products fall into three main categories — 1 illiquid alternatives 2 liquid alternatives and 3 currency and commodities illiquid alternatives include offerings in alternative solutions private equity opportunistic and credit real estate and infrastructure liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions funds of funds

in 2020 liquid and illiquid alternatives generated a combined 174 billion of net inflows or 257 billion excluding return of capitalinvestment of 83 billion the largest contributors to return of capitalinvestment were private equity solutions infrastructure and opportunistic and credit strategies net inflows were driven by direct hedge funds infrastructure private equity and opportunistic and credit strategies at yearend blackrock had approximately 24 billion of nonfee paying unfunded uninvested commitments which are expected to be deployed in future years these commitments are not included in aum or flows until they are feepaying currency and commodities saw 198 billion of net inflows primarily into commodities ishares etfs

blackrock believes that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings blackrock’s highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to continue to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors

systemically important financial institution “sifi” review 

the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as sifis in the united states under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 “doddfrank” in july 2014 the fsoc pivoted from its previous entityspecific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activitiesbased approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management in december 2019 the fsoc reaffirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activitiesbased approach this reduces the risk of entitylevel designation however it remains too early to predict the direction of the forthcoming regulatory environment and the fsoc retains the authority to designate an entity if an activitiesbased approach does not adequately address potential risks in the event that blackrock is designated as a sifi it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve the “federal reserve” 

 

federal trade commission proposal 

in september 2020 the federal trade commission “ftc” released a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing updates to premerger notification rules enacted under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 “hsr” that require parties to certain transactions to provide the ftc and the antitrust division of the department of justice prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions the proposals would i require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing hsr filing and exemption thresholds and ii create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10 of an issuer which would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1 in competing firms if enacted as drafted the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could absent exemptions for indexfunds or certain types of registered funds substantially increase blackrock’s premerger notification obligations which may be costly impair funds’ ability to trade freely require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both blackrock and the companies in which it invests in instances where making a premerger notification may not be practicable the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of blackrock’s aggregate position in certain issuers

taxation 

blackrock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus tax authorities in the us legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax “ftt” on stocks bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions in the european union “eu” certain member states have also enacted similar ftts and the european commission “ec” has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of eulevel legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states if enacted as proposed ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s financial results and clients’ performance results 

the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock these challenges may result in adjustments to or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition similarly the company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by blackrock or to specific tax rules to the extent there are changes in tax law or policy or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by blackrock the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and blackrock may suffer financial or reputational harm

regulation of swaps and derivatives 

the securities and exchange commission “sec” federal reserve the internal revenue service and the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures swaps and other derivatives such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts if adopted any such limitations or restrictions could require blackrock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes which could result in additional costs andor restrictions 

in october 2020 the sec adopted new regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies “rics” including mutual funds other than money market funds etfs and closedend funds as well as business development companies rics will be required to implement and comply with the new rule by the third quarter of 2022 once implemented the rule will among other things impose limits on the amount of derivatives transactions a ric can enter into eliminate the current asset segregation compliance framework and introduce new compliance requirements for funds including the establishment of comprehensive risk management programs the rule may impact certain rics’ usage of derivatives and investment strategy 

jurisdictions outside the us in which blackrock operates have adopted and implemented or are in the process of considering adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could further impact blackrock and the broader markets for example various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require blackrock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject these rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods reporting transactions to central data repositories mandating certain documentation standards requiring the posting and collection of initial andor variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed andor overthecounter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements

in the us certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to doddfrank central clearing and trading venue execution requirements with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future in the eu central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of blackrock funds and accounts on march 1 2017 most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared including nondeliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions became subject to requirements in the us eu and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect marktomarket margin payments for certain blackrock funds and accounts initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such marktomarket margin payments these rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading noncleared derivatives for blackrocks clients and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase blackrock’s operational and legal risks

regulation of exchangetraded funds 

as part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years regulators globally are examining the implications of an increased presence of etfs in the markets including those related to transparency liquidity and structural resiliency blackrock and other sponsors of etfs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to blackrock or at all depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis or any associated structural reforms etf products may become subject to increased 

 

regulatory scrutiny or restrictions which may require blackrock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the company’s business 

regulation of money market funds

in october 2016 rules were implemented to reform the regulatory structure governing us money market funds to address perceived systemic risks of money market funds the rules require institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the marketbased value of fund assets retail money market funds continue operating with a constant net asset value per share the rules additionally provide for tools for institutional and retail money market funds’ boards designed to address market shocks including the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain circumstances

in addition following market liquidity issues that arose in march 2020 in connection with the spread of the covid19 pandemic regulatory authorities are focused on the need for further regulation for certain money market funds in december 2020 the president’s working group on financial markets issued a report outlining ten potential policy measures for consideration to improve the resiliency of money market funds and the broader shortterm funding markets although it remains too early to accurately predict the forthcoming regulatory environment including with respect to regulation of money market funds certain of these reforms if ever adopted could significantly impact money market funds and the money market fund industry

standards of conduct rulemaking

securities and exchange commission rulemakings for us registered funds and investment advisers 

blackrock’s business may also be impacted by sec regulatory initiatives the sec and its staff recently have engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies in particular these efforts relate to among other things embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices cybersecurity liquidity enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks over the past year the sec has adopted rules that include among other things i a new regulatory framework for fund of funds structures and ii updated eligibility requirements for submitting shareholder proposals under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” these rules and any additional rules or regulatory initiatives resulting from the secs efforts may increase blackrock’s regulatory compliance requirements as well as disclosure requirements which could be costly and may impede blackrock’s growth

financial crimes enforcement network proposed rulemaking for registered investment advisers

in 2015 the financial crime enforcement network “fincen” issued a notice of proposed rulemaking “proposed rule” that would extend to a number of blackrock’s subsidiaries which are registered or required to be registered as investment advisers with the sec under the advisers act the requirement to establish written riskbased antimoney laundering programs and report suspicious activity to fincen under the bank secrecy act of 1970 the “bank secrecy act” the proposed rule would include investment advisers within the bank secrecy act’s definition of “financial institutions” which would require them to comply with the bank secrecy act reporting and recordkeeping requirements if adopted in its current form the proposed rule would expose blackrock to additional compliance costs

eu market access

the ec and certain eu member states have recently advanced a more restrictive approach to the need for a third country ie noneu country to obtain “equivalence” which is the process by which the legal regulatory andor supervisory system in noneu member states is recognised by the ec as comparably effective to that in the eu thereby allowing firms established in such noneu member states a degree of access to the eu single market in financial services in addition in 2019 the ec commenced a review of the alternative investment fund managers directive “aifmd” to assess among other things the conditions for delegating portfolio management mandates to third countries the effectiveness of regulation on third country fund marketing passports and the continuation of national private placement regimes to the extent the review results in formal legislation that limits the scope of existing permitted activities and eu market access rights for asset management firms with noneu operations or extends more stringent rules to the directive on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” blackrock’s ability to offer collective investment funds and certain investment services to eubased clients may be adversely affected

 item 1a risk factors

as a global investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks while blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify measure monitor manage and analyze market operating legal compliance reputational fiduciary and investment risks blackrock’s business financial condition operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties including the ones discussed below 

market and competition risks 

changes in the value levels of equity debt real assets commodities foreign exchange or other asset markets as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs may cause assets under management “aum” revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client numerous factors including price movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs could cause 











the occurrence of any of these events may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

changes in interest or foreign exchange rates andor divergent beta may cause blackrock’s aum and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the company’s net income and operating cash flows

in recent years there have been prolonged periods of historically low interest rates interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates blackrock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates similarly due to the global nature of blackrock’s operations a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar any failure by blackrock to manage movements in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar or its exposure to interest rates may cause blackrock’s aum to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the company’s base fees net income and operating cash flows 

in addition beta divergence between equity markets where certain markets perform differently than others may lead to an increase in the proportion of blackrock aum weighted toward lower fee equity products resulting in a decline in blackrock’s effective fee rate divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of aum and base fees 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services the advisory or management contracts blackrock has entered into with its clients including the agreements that govern many of blackrock’s investment funds provide investors or in some cases the independent directors of applicable investment funds with significant latitude to terminate such contracts withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty or to remove blackrock as a fund’s investment advisor or equivalent blackrock also manages its us mutual funds closedend and exchangetraded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors a majority of whom are independent from the company blackrock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors in addition if a number of blackrock’s clients terminate their contracts or otherwise remove blackrock from its advisory roles liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms the fees or carried interest blackrock earns could be reduced which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause aum in similar blackrock products to decline irrespective of blackrock’s performance 

 

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by blackrock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar blackrock products irrespective of the performance of such products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

 

increased competition may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the investment management industry is highly competitive and blackrock competes based on a number of factors including investment performance its technology and portfolio construction offerings the level of fees charged the quality and breadth of services and products provided name recognition and reputation and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors in addition over the past several years there has been significant consolidation in the asset management and financial services industries as investors increasingly seek out firms that have the capacity to deliver broad multiasset investment capabilities and technological expertise including in a manner that is responsive to ever more localized needs this consolidation together with the introduction of new technologies as well as regulatory changes continues to alter the competitive landscape for investment managers which may lead to additional fee compression or require blackrock to invest more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and 

 

remain competitive with the products services and geographic diversity offered by other financial institutions technology companies trading advisory or asset management firms increased competition on the basis of any of these factors including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure to maintain aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the sophisticated risk analytics portfolio management trade execution and investment operations that blackrock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and aladdin clients are important elements of blackrock’s competitive success aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management trading and operations tools on a single platform increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions whether due to price competition perceived client market share platform flexibility or marketbased or regulatory factors may weaken aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the company’s revenue and earnings to decline in addition to the extent that aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than blackrock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings blackrock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share which may impede its productivity and growth moreover although blackrock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in aladdin

blackrock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the company certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with blackrock’s activities certain of blackrock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities including the securities and exchange commission office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” department of labor commodity futures trading commission financial conduct authority commission de surveillance du secteur financial and federal reserve similarly from time to time blackrock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various us and nonus governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industrywide companyspecific or other investigations proceedings or litigations these examinations inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future if compliance failures or other violations are found cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings andor impose sanctions for violations any such action may also result in litigation by investors in blackrock’s funds other blackrock clients or blackrock’s shareholders which could harm the company’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the company being liable for damages 

in addition when clients retain blackrock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that blackrock must observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose blackrock to lawsuits harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts 

damage to blackrock’s reputation may harm its business 

  blackrock’s reputation is critical to its relationships with its clients employees shareholders and business partners blackrock’s reputation may be harmed by among other factors regulatory or enforcement actions technology or operational failures poor investment performance ineffective management or monitoring of key thirdparty relationships cybersecurity or other privacy incidents employee errors or misconduct a failure to manage environmental social and governance risks or a failure to manage conflicts of interest in addition blackrock’s business scale and investments subject it to significant media coverage and increasing attention from a broad range of stakeholders this heightened scrutiny has resulted in negative publicity for blackrock in the past and may do so in the future in addition the increasing popularity of social media and nonmainstream internet news sources may lead to faster and wider dissemination of any adverse publicity or inaccurate information about blackrock making effective remediation more difficult damage to blackrock’s reputation may impact blackrock’s ability to attract and retain clients employees shareholders and business partners which may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

a failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest could result in litigation or enforcement actions andor adversely affect blackrock’s business and reputation which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

as a global investment management firm that provides investment and technology services to a diverse range of clients the company must routinely address and manage conflicts of interest as well as the perception of conflicts of interest between itself and its clients employees or vendors while blackrock has policies controls and disclosure protocols in place to manage and address potential conflicts of interest identifying and mitigating conflicts of interest can be complex and is the subject of increasing regulatory and media scrutiny it is possible that 

 

actual potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor or client dissatisfaction adverse publicity litigation or enforcement actions in particular blackrock’s broad range of investment advisory and technology offerings and its focus on providing clients with whole portfolio solutions may result in clients working with multiple blackrock businesses andor blackrock being engaged by institutions that have a nexus to industries or jurisdictions in which blackrock operates which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing to the extent that blackrock fails or appears to fail to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest it may face adverse publicity reputational damage litigation regulatory proceedings client attrition penalties fines andor sanctions any of which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is subject to us banking regulations that may limit its business activities 

blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary which is a national banking association chartered by the occ is subject to occ regulation and capital requirements the occ has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over blackrock’s trust bank being subject to banking regulation may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations 

the implications of complying with threshold limits andor any failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to blackrock’s reputation impact the performance of certain blackrock funds and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

of note among the various international regulations to which blackrock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels thresholds across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the company the specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions blackrock continues to invest in technology training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions despite these investments the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future any such errors may expose blackrock to monetary penalties or other sanctions which could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

moreover as blackrock’s business grows it is becoming subject to a greater number of regulatory industrylevel or issuerspecific threshold limits that may prevent blackrock from holding positions in certain equity securities securities convertible into equity securities or futures contracts in excess of certain thresholds although blackrock is actively engaged in regulatory issuerspecific and structural initiatives to create additional investment capacity threshold limits may nonetheless prevent the purchase of certain securities which may in turn impact the performance of certain blackrock index funds by increasing tracking error relative to the funds’ benchmarks and impact the performance of certain blackrock actively managed funds by preventing them from taking advantage of alpha generating opportunities

blackrock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about index investing and common ownership 

as a leader in the index investing and asset management industry blackrock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries known as “common ownership” the commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows create stock price bubbles or conversely exacerbate a decline in market prices additional commentary focuses on competition issues associated with common ownership and purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain concentrated industries with higher consumer prices and executive compensation among other things in the us the ftc during 2018 held hearings on competition and consumer protection in the 21 st century which included a discussion of common ownership and in 2020 common ownership was cited as a disqualifying factor in a newly proposed exemption from the ftc’s premerger notification rules common ownership was also cited as a consideration underlying the ftc’s consultation on the rules that apply to acquisitions of voting securities by investment entities although the ftc acknowledged that the common ownership debate remains unsettled it is expected that common ownership may be given greater consideration in connection with ftc rule proposals policy decisions andor the scrutiny of mergers in the eu both the ec and the european parliament released reports in 2020 on common ownership neither report took a position that common ownership had an adverse impact on competition it is expected that common ownership will continue to be a focus for the ec among others including in the assessment of mergers and investigations there is substantial literature highlighting the benefits of index investing as well as casting doubt on the assumptions data methodology and conclusions associated with common ownership arguments nevertheless some commentators have proposed remedies including limits on stakes managed by asset managers that if enacted into policy could have a negative impact on the capital markets increase transaction costs and limit the availability of products for investors this may in turn adversely affect blackrock

new tax legislation or changes to existing us and nonus tax laws treaties and regulations or challenges to blackrock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate business and overall financial condition 

blackrock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus tax authorities in the us legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax “ftt” on stocks bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions in the eu certain member states have also enacted similar ftts and the ec has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of eulevel legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states if enacted as proposed ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s financial results and clients’ performance results 

the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock these challenges may result in adjustments to or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition similarly the company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by blackrock or to specific tax rules to the extent there are changes in tax law or policy or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by blackrock the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and blackrock may suffer financial or reputational harm

united kingdom exit from european union 

 

on december 31 2020 the united kingdom “uk” left the european union “eu” and the uk and eu reverted to being distinct regulatory legal and customs territories although an “euuk trade and cooperation agreement” was agreed to in connection with the uk’s departure from the eu it does not include any substantive provisions with respect to financial services as a result from january 1 2021 crossborder financial services trade between the uk and the eu will be governed by their respective financial services regulations and market access regimes blackrock has implemented a number of steps to prepare for this outcome these steps which are and have been time consuming and costly and may add complexity to blackrock’s future european operations include effecting organizational governance and operational changes applying for and receiving additional licenses and permissions in the eu and engaging in client communications in addition depending on how the future relationship between the uk and the eu develops blackrock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its european operations particularly with regards to delegation and outsourcing which may impede the company’s growth or impact its financial performance

 

other development

on february 13 2020 blackrock announced the establishment of the blackrock foundation the “foundation” and the contribution of its remaining 20 stake in pennymac financial services inc “pennymac” to the foundation and the blackrock charitable fund which blackrock established in 2013 together the “charitable contribution” the charitable contribution resulted in an operating expense of 589 million which was offset by a 122 million noncash nonoperating pretax gain on the contributed shares and a tax benefit of 241 million in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2020 the charitable contribution provides longterm funding for blackrock’s philanthropic investments and partnerships the general and administration expense nonoperating gain and associated tax benefit related to the charitable contribution have been excluded from as adjusted results

business outlook 

blackrocks framework for longterm value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis blackrocks diversified platform in terms of style product client and geography enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles positioning blackrock to invest for the longterm by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management

 

the covid19 pandemic continues to result in governmental authorities taking numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of covid19 such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and limitations on business activity including closures these measures may continue to among other things severely restrict global economic activity which can disrupt supply chains lower asset valuations significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets 

towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact blackrock’s business while global markets have significantly recovered since then the effects of the pandemic are ongoing and such impact may continue in future quarters if conditions persist or worsen 

the aggregate extent to which covid19 and the related global economic crisis affect blackrock’s business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period future actions taken by governmental authorities central banks and other third parties including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform in response to the pandemic and the effects on blackrock’s products clients vendors and employees see part i item 1a  risk factors herein for information on the possible future effects of the covid19 pandemic on our results

in addition although the forthcoming environment remains uncertain blackrock’s business may be impacted by governmental changes as well as potential regulations foreign and trade policies and fiscal spending that may arise as a result of such changes 

blackrock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of aum and in some cases performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client numerous factors including price movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests on behalf of clients could impact blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings 

blackrock is currently voluntarily waiving a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintain a minimum level of daily net investment income these waivers result in a reduction of management fees a portion of which is partially offset by a reduction of blackrock’s distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries blackrock has provided voluntary yield support waivers in prior periods and may increase or decrease the level of fee waivers in future periods

blackrock manages 44 trillion of equity assets across markets globally beta divergence between equity markets where certain markets perform differently than others may lead to an increase in the proportion of blackrock aum weighted toward lower fee equity products resulting in a decline in blackrock’s effective fee rate divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of aum and investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue collectively “base fees”

blackrock’s highly diversified multiproduct platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments blackrock is positioned to provide alphaseeking active index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies in addition blackrock leverages its worldclass risk management analytics and technology capabilities including the aladdin platform on behalf of clients blackrock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe including investors in ishares etfs maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus the diversity of blackrock’s platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments and as client preferences evolve client demand continues for etfs and illiquid alternatives which are two areas of focus for blackrock

the index investing industry has been growing rapidly – with etfs as a major beneficiary – driven by structural tailwinds including the migration from commissionbased to feebased wealth management clients’ focus on value for money the use of etfs as alpha tools and the growth of alltoall networked trading ishares etfs’ growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth themes in client and 

 

product segments including core strategic which includes fixed income factors sustainable and megatrends etfs and precision exposures 

as the wealth management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a wholeportfolio approach blackrock’s retail strategy is focused on creating outcomeoriented client solutions this includes having a diverse platform of alphaseeking active index and alternative products as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings digital wealth tools are an important component of blackrock’s retail strategy as blackrock scales and customizes model portfolios extends aladdin wealth and digital wealth partnerships globally and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk management powered by aladdin in february 2021 blackrock acquired aperio a pioneer in customizing taxoptimized index equity smas to enhance our wealth platform and provide wholeportfolio solutions to ultrahigh net worth advisors by combining aperio with blackrock’s existing sma franchise the company plans to expand the breadth of personalization capabilities available to wealth managers from blackrock via taxmanaged strategies across factors broad market indexing and investor environmental social and governance preferences across all asset classes 

blackrock continues to invest in technology services offerings which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk effectively serve clients and operate efficiently anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions blackrock’s aladdin platform provides clients with an ability to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform

across blackrock more clients are focusing on the impact of sustainability on their portfolios this shift has been driven by an increased understanding of how sustainabilityrelated factors can affect economic growth asset values and financial markets as a whole as a fiduciary blackrock is committed to helping clients build more resilient portfolios since sustainable investment options have the potential to offer clients better outcomes the company is making sustainability integral to the way blackrock manages risk constructs portfolios designs products and engages with companies over the past several years blackrock has been deepening the integration of sustainability into technology risk management and product choice across blackrock and plans to accelerate those efforts

2020 compared with 2019

gaap   operating income of 5695 million increased 144 million and operating margin of 351 decreased 310 bps from 2019 operating income and operating margin reflected higher base fees performance fees and technology services revenue which were more than offset by higher expense including the impact of 589 million related to the charitable contribution higher compensation and benefits expense and higher product launch costs in 2020 product launch costs in 2020 included 87 million and 83 million associated with the close of the 23 billion blackrock health sciences trust ii and the 2 billion blackrock capital allocation trust respectively product launch costs for 2019 included 61 million associated with the close of the 14 billion blackrock science and technology trust ii 

nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests “nci” increased 289 million from 2019 driven by the impact of a pretax gain of approximately 240 million in connection with a recapitalization of icapital network inc “icapital” and 122 million pretax gain related to the charitable contribution partially offset by lower marktomarket gains on unhedged seed capital investments and lower interest income 

income tax expense for 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of 241 million recognized in connection with the charitable contribution partially offset by a noncash net expense of approximately 79 million associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities related to the legislation enacted in the united kingdom increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes income tax expense for 2020 also included 139 million of net discrete tax benefits including benefits related to changes in the company’s organizational entity structure and stockbased compensation awards income tax expense for 2019 included 28 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to stockbased compensation awards

diluted earnings per common share increased 342 or 12 from 2019 reflecting higher revenue and nonoperating income and a lower diluted share count partially offset by the impact of the charitable contribution and higher product launch costs for 2020

as adjusted    operating income of 6284 million increased 733 million and operating margin of 449 increased 120 bps from 2019 diluted earnings per common share increased 534 or 19 from 2019 primarily due to higher operating and nonoperating income and a lower diluted share count in 2020 the financial impact related to the charitable contribution and the noncash net tax expense associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities described above has been excluded from as adjusted results 

see nongaap financial measures for further information on as adjusted items 

for further discussion of blackrock’s revenue expense nonoperating results and income tax expense see discussion of financial results herein 

 

nongaap financial measures 

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” however management believes evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful for both management and investors in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance over time management also uses nongaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented nongaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock’s revenue and expense blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap nongaap measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

management uses both gaap and nongaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance adjustments to gaap financial measures “nongaap adjustments” include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow 

computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows 

1 operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted 

 



 

management believes operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time and therefore provide useful disclosure to investors management believes that operating margin as adjusted reflects the company’s longterm ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues the company uses operating margin as adjusted to assess the company’s financial performance and to determine the longterm and annual compensation of the company’s seniorlevel employees furthermore this metric is used to evaluate the company’s relative performance against industry peers as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers

 







 

2 nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted 

 



management believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods management believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides a useful measure for both management and investors of blackrock’s nonoperating results which ultimately impact blackrock’s book value in 2020 the noncash 

 

nonoperating pretax gain of 122 million related to the charitable contribution has been excluded from nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature 

 

3 net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted 

 



 

management believes net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted and diluted earnings per common share as adjusted are useful measures of blackrock’s profitability and financial performance net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted equals net income attributable to blackrock inc gaap basis adjusted for significant nonrecurring items charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow

see aforementioned discussion regarding operating income as adjusted operating margin as adjusted and nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted for information on the charitable contribution

in 2020 a discrete tax benefit of 241 million was recognized in connection with the charitable contribution the discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the charitable contribution amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash benefits expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes the amount for 2020 included a 79 million net noncash expense related to the impact of legislation enacted in the united kingdom increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes these amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented

per share amounts reflect net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted divided by diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding

4 nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations as of december 31 2020 there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding

discussion of financial results 

introduction

the company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception the identification of whether a contract contains a lease requires judgment including determining whether there are identified assets in the contract that the company has control over for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration 

 

fixed lease payments are included in the measurement of rou assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition the company recognizes rou assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of the se future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date discounted using the company’s incremental borrowing rate “ibr” management judgment is required in determining the company’s ibr including assessing the company’s credit rating using various financial metrics such as revenue operating margin and revenue growth and as appropriate performing market analysis of yields on publicly traded bonds secured or unsecured of comparable companies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information on leases 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary openend investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost in addition trade namestrademarks are considered indefinitelived intangibles if they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 

finitelived management contracts which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds investorcustomer relationships and technology related assets that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the company for a specified period of time are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2020 ranged from 1 to 10 years with a weightedaverage remaining estimated useful life of seven years 

goodwill the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment assessment performed as of july 31 2020 indicated no impairment charge was required the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2020 the company’s common stock closed at 72154 which exceeded its book value of approximately 23131 per share 

 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinitelife and finitelife classifications are still appropriate 

 

in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is less than carrying value blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates in addition the company considered other factors including i macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or other developments in equity and credit markets ii industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the company operates an increased competitive environment a decline in marketdependent multiples or metrics a change in the market for an entity’s services or regulatory legal or political developments and iii the companyspecific events such as a change in management or key personnel overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset if an indefinitelived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs

for finitelived intangible assets if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform a recoverability test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 106 million 97 million and 50 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

in 2020 2019 and 2018 the company performed impairment tests including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments the company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinitelived versus finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

contingent consideration liabilities

in connection with certain acquisitions blackrock is required to make contingent payments subject to achieving specified performance targets the fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated at the time of acquisition closing and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition as the fair value of the expected payments amount subsequently changes the contingent consideration liability is adjusted resulting in contingent consideration fair value adjustments recorded within general and administration expense of the consolidated statements of income cash payments up to the acquisition date fair value amount of the contingent consideration liability are reflected as financing activities with excess if any cash payments classified in operating activities any cash payments made soon after the acquisition date will be classified in investing activities

 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services the company enters into contracts that can include multiple services which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct management judgment is required to identify distinct services and involves assessing such factors as whether the promised services significantly modify or customize one another or are highly interdependent or interrelated management judgment may be also required when determining the following when variable consideration is no longer probable of significant reversal and hence can be included in revenue whether certain revenue should be presented gross or net of certain related costs when a promised service transfers to the customer and the applicable method of measuring progress for services transferred to the customer over time many of blackrocks promised services represent a series of distinct services eg investment advisory services in which the associated variable consideration eg management fees is allocated to specific days of service as opposed to over the entire contract term

investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the company fees are primarily based on agreedupon percentages of aum and recognized for services provided during the period which are distinct from services provided in other periods such fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows aum represents the broad range of financial assets the company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue for example net asset values 

the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients primarily to highly rated banks and brokerdealers the securities loaned are secured by collateral generally ranging from 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities for 2020 2019 and 2018 securities lending revenue earned by the company totaled 652 million 617 million and 627 million respectively and is recorded in investment advisory administration and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee 

the company receives investment advisory performance fees including incentive allocations carried interest from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds which may vary by product or account and include monthly quarterly annual or longer measurement periods

performance fees including carried interest are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of aum becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period given the unique nature of each fee arrangement contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition significant judgement is involved in making such determination performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods consequently a portion of the fees the company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period at each reporting date the company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized including carried interest these factors include but are not limited to whether 1 the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the company’s influence 2 the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts and 3 the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds 

the company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds the company may be required to reversereturn all or part of such carried interest allocationsdistributions depending upon future performance of these products carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition 

the company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2020 and 2019 the company had 584 million and 483 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition a portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense if any for these products is unknown see note 17 revenue  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2020 and 2019

fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixedrate basis revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights

distribution and service fees earned for distributing investment products and providing support services to investment portfolios are based on aum and are recognized when the amount of fees is known

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until 1 performance thresholds have been exceeded and 2 management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal

 

income taxes 

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2020 blackrock had 940 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 565 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2020 the company had deferred income tax assets of 304 million and deferred income tax liabilities of 3673 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company 

the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard the assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately 175 million and current income taxes payables of 131 million at december 31 2020

the company’s aum by product type for the years 2015 through 2019 is presented below 

 



 



 

component changes in aum by product type for the five years ended december 31 201 9 are presented below 

 



 





 

aum represents the broad range of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue for example net asset value reported aum does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice or assets that we are retained to manage on a shortterm temporary basis 

investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of aum we also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreedupon benchmark or return hurdle on some products we also may earn securities lending revenue in addition blackrock offers its proprietary aladdin investment system as well as risk management outsourcing advisory and other technology services to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions number of users or accomplishment of specific deliverables 

at december 31 2019 total aum was 743 trillion representing a cagr of 10 over the last five years aum growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains net inflows and acquisitions including bkca infraestructura institucional and futureadvisor which collectively added 22 billion of aum in 2015 bofa global capital management which added 806 billion of aum in 2016 the first reserve transaction which added 33 billion of aum in 2017 and the net aum impact from the tcp transaction the citibanamex transaction the aegon transaction and the dsp transaction which added 275 billion of aum in 2018 our aum mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range as described below

client type and product type

component changes in aum by product type and investment style for 2019 are presented below 

 



 

longterm product offerings include alphaseeking active and index strategies our alphaseeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction in contrast index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index index strategies include both our nonetf index products and ishares etfs 

although many clients use both alphaseeking active and index strategies the application of these strategies may differ for example clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns in addition institutional nonetf index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and typically reflect low fee rates net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

equity 

yearend 2019 equity aum totaled 38 trillion reflecting net inflows of 284 billion net inflows included 647 billion into ishares etfs driven by net inflows into core funds and factorbased etfs partially offset by nonetf index and active net outflows of 334 billion and 29 billion respectively

blackrock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix approximately half of blackrock’s equity aum is tied to international markets including emerging markets which tend to have higher fee rates than us equity strategies accordingly fluctuations in international 

 

equity markets which may not consistently move in tandem with us markets have a greater impact on blackrock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate 

fixed income 

fixed income aum ended 2019 at 23 trillion reflecting net inflows of 2636 billion ishares etfs net inflows of 1123 billion were led by flows into core treasuries and mortgagebacked securities funds nonetf index net inflows of 763 billion were driven by demand for liabilitydriven investment solutions active net inflows of 750 billion included two sizable institutional client wins in the second quarter of 2019 in addition to strong flows in municipal total return high yield and short duration bond offerings

component changes in multiasset aum for 2019 are presented below

 





multiasset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutionsbased advice with 281 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows and contributed 189 billion to institutional multiasset net inflows in 2019 primarily into target date and target risk product offerings retail net outflows of 93 billion were primarily due to outflows from world allocation strategies 

the company’s multiasset strategies include the following 









alternatives 

blackrock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing highalpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing our alternatives products fall into three main categories — 1 illiquid alternatives 2 liquid alternatives and 3 currency and commodities illiquid alternatives include offerings in alternative solutions private equity opportunistic and credit real estate and infrastructure liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions funds of funds

 

in 2019 alternatives generated 248 billion of net inflows or 308 billion excluding return of capitalinvestment of 60 billion the largest contributors to return of capitalinvestment were private equity solutions opportunistic and credit strategies real estate and infrastructure net inflows were driven by infrastructure direct hedge funds real estate and private equity and opportunistic strategies at yearend we had approximately 24 billion of nonfee paying unfunded uninvested commitments which are expected to be deployed in future years these commitments are not included in aum or flows until they are feepaying

we believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings our highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors

securities lending 

securities lending is managed by a dedicated team supported by quantitative analysis proprietary technology and disciplined risk management blackrock receives both cash primarily for us domiciled portfolios and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements the cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios fees for securities lending for us domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both the value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed the value of the collateral is not included in aum 

outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately 290 billion up from 267 billion at yearend 2018 on average relative to 2018 intrinsic lending spreads were slightly lower while average cash reinvestment rates remained roughly flat however continued asset gathering in lending products resulted in increased balances compared to 2018

blackrock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality liquidity and interest rate risk management disciplined risk management including a rigorous credit surveillance process is an integral part of the investment process blackrock’s cash management credit committee has established risk limits such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits across many of the products blackrock manages including over all of its cash management products in the ordinary course of our business there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed no such instances individually or in the aggregate have been material to the company to the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded the relevant portfolio will be adjusted to the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers while a risk limit may be waived temporarily such waivers are infrequent 

risk  quantitative analysis 

across all asset classes in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams the risk  quantitative analysis “rqa” group at blackrock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and thirdparty data to identify measure and manage a wide range of risks rqa provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk managementrelated analytical and information requirements where appropriate rqa will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics

regulation

virtually all aspects of blackrock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world some of which are summarized below these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients investors in registered and unregistered investment companies and trust and other fiduciary clients of blackrock institutional trust company na “btc” under these laws and regulations agencies that regulate investment advisers investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers including the power to limit restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters censures and fines both for individuals and blackrock 

the rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical accordingly the discussion below is general in nature does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report 

global regulatory reform 

blackrock’s business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world any such initiative or any new laws or regulations or changes to or in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities lead to business disruptions require blackrock to alter its business or operating activities and expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and legal costs as well as reputational harm blackrock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing banking taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce 

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank” was signed into law in the united states doddfrank is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions many of which have been adopted blackrock has implemented a conformance program to address certain regulations adopted under doddfrank as well as financial reforms that have been introduced as part of the securities and exchange commission’s “sec” investment company modernization initiatives the cost of these conformance activities has been substantially absorbed by blackrock however as certain limited aspects of doddfrank and other rules are still being adopted it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that any implementation of these rules and regulations will have upon blackrock’s business financial condition and operating activities

systemically important financial institution “sifi” review 

the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as sifis in the united states in july 2014 the fsoc pivoted from its previous entityspecific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activitiesbased approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management in december 2019 the fsoc reaffirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activitiesbased approach this reduces the risk of entitylevel designation however the fsoc retains the authority to designate an entity if an activitiesbased approach does not adequately address potential risks in the event that blackrock is designated as a sifi under doddfrank it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve the “federal reserve”

taxation 

blackrock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus tax authorities in the us legislation has been proposed in the house and senate to enact a financial transaction tax “ftt” on stocks bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions in the european union “eu” certain member states have also enacted similar ftts and the european commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of eulevel legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states if enacted as proposed ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s financial results and clients’ performance results 

the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock these challenges may result in adjustments to or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition similarly the company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by blackrock or to specific tax rules to the extent there are changes in tax law or policy or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by blackrock the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and blackrock may suffer financial or reputational harm

regulation of swaps and derivatives 

the sec federal reserve the internal revenue service “irs” and the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures swaps and other derivatives such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts if adopted these limitations could require blackrock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes which could result in additional costs andor restrictions 

 

in november 2019 the sec proposed a rule designed to enhance the regulation of the use of derivatives by registered investment companies including mutual funds other than money market funds etfs and closedend funds as well as business development companies the proposed rule would permit such funds to use derivatives such as forwards futures swaps and written options that create future payment obligations provided that the funds comply with certain conditions including adopting a derivatives risk management program and complying with a limit on the amount of leveragerelated risk that a fund may obtain based on valueatrisk if adopted without change the proposed rule would increase blackrock’s disclosure and compliance obligations and may impact certain funds’ usage of derivatives and investment strategy 

 

jurisdictions outside the us in which blackrock operates have adopted and implemented or are in the process of considering adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could further impact blackrock and the broader markets for example various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require blackrock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject these rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods reporting transactions to central data repositories mandating certain documentation standards requiring the posting and collection of initial andor variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed andor overthecounter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements

in the us certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to doddfrank central clearing and electronic trading venue execution requirements with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future in the eu central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of blackrock funds and accounts on march 1 2017 most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared including nondeliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions became subject to requirements in the us eu and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect marktomarket margin payments for certain blackrock funds and accounts initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such marktomarket margin payments these rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading noncleared derivatives for blackrocks clients and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase blackrock’s operational and legal risks

regulation of exchangetraded funds 

as part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years regulators globally are examining the implications of an increased presence of etfs in the markets including those related to transparency liquidity and structural resiliency blackrock and other sponsors of etfs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to blackrock or at all depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis or any associated structural reforms etf products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions which may require blackrock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the company’s business

in addition in september 2019 the sec adopted rule 6c11 under the investment company act of 1940 the “investment company act” known as the “etf rule” the etf rule will allow etfs that satisfy certain conditions to operate without first obtaining individual exemptive relief from the sec the etf rule is designed to create a clear and consistent regulatory framework for most etfs operating today and will impact all blackrock etfs registered under the investment company act including ishares etfs the etf rule and related form amendments became effective in december 2019 the form amendments will have a transition period of one year following the effective date in addition the etf rule rescinds one year after its effective date the existing exemptive relief for all eligible etfs including ishares etfs

volcker rule 

provisions of doddfrank referred to as the “volcker rule” created a new section of the bank holding company act of 1956 the “bank holding company act” that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds including hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds collectively “covered funds” the bank holding company act by its terms does not currently apply to blackrock the federal reserve has taken the position that pnc’s ownership interest in blackrock which is approximately 22 in combination with certain other factors causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for the purpose of the bank holding company act and that blackrock is subject to banking regulation based on this interpretation of the bank holding company act the federal reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that pnc controls blackrock under the terms of the bank holding company act any such determination if successful would subject blackrock to current and future regulatory requirements under the bank holding company act including the volcker rule conformance with the volcker rule may require blackrock to sell certain seed and coinvestments that it holds in its covered funds which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions

standards of conduct rulemaking

in june 2019 the sec adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations addressing investment adviser and brokerdealer standards of conduct the package includes new rules requiring registered advisers and registered brokerdealers to provide a relationship summary to retail investors a new rule establishing a standard of conduct for brokerdealers when making recommendations to retail customers and two new interpretations under the investment advisers act of 1940 the “advisers act” the rulemakings and interpretations could increase blackrock’s disclosure obligations impact distribution arrangements between blackrock and its distribution partners create compliance and operational challenges for blackrock’s distribution partners and limit blackrock’s ability to provide certain other services to its clients the department of labor “dol” has also indicated it intends to propose a standards of conduct rule in 2020

 

 

sec guidance on proxy voting responsibilities of investment advisors 

 

in august 2019 the sec published guidance to assist investment advisers with their proxy voting responsibilities under the advisers act the guidance confirmed that investment advisers’ fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to their clients apply to proxy voting and encouraged advisors with voting authority to review their policies and procedures in detail and consider whether more analysis may be required under certain circumstances including when a proxy advisory firm’s services are retained this guidance could impact voting arrangements between blackrock and its clients and lead to additional compliance operational and disclosure obligations for blackrock 

 

financial crimes enforcement network proposed rulemaking for registered investment advisers

in 2015 the financial crime enforcement network “fincen” issued a notice of proposed rulemaking “proposed rule” that would extend to a number of blackrock’s subsidiaries which are registered or required to be registered as investment advisers with the sec under the advisers act the requirement to establish written riskbased antimoney laundering programs and report suspicious activity to fincen under the bank secrecy act of 1970 the “bank secrecy act” the proposed rule would include investment advisers within the bank secrecy act’s definition of “financial institutions” which would require them to comply with the bank secrecy act reporting and recordkeeping requirements if adopted in its current form the proposed rule would expose blackrock to additional compliance costs

securities and exchange commission rulemakings for us registered funds and investment advisers 

blackrock’s business may also be impacted by sec regulatory initiatives the sec and its staff are engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies in particular these efforts relate to among other things embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices cybersecurity liquidity enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks the sec has adopted rules that include i new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain us registered funds ii enhanced reporting regimes for investment advisers and iii implementing liquidity risk management programs for etfs and openend funds other than money market funds these rules increase and any additional rules or regulatory initiatives resulting from the secs efforts may increase blackrock’s public reporting and disclosure requirements which could be costly and may impede blackrock’s growth 

us executive order

on february 3 2017 an executive order the “executive order” was issued articulating certain core principles for regulating the us financial system and directing the secretary of the us treasury to report on the extent to which existing laws treaties rules regulations and policies promote support or inhibit the federal regulation of the us financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles treasury has issued four reports in response to the executive order the “treasury reports” which include a number of recommendations the majority of which require further legislative or regulatory action in order to be implemented that may affect blackrock’s business or operations blackrock will continue to monitor the potential impact of the executive order as well as the treasury reports and any consequential legislative or regulatory action on its business

british exit from the eu 

following the june 2016 vote to exit the eu commonly referred to as brexit the united kingdom “uk” left the eu on january 31 2020 and entered an elevenmonth transition period during which the uk and ukbased entities will retain the rights and obligations of eu membership 

substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the future relationship between the uk and eu but the uk government has indicated its preference for negotiating a trade deal with the eu before the end of the transition period rather than continuing single market or customs union membership blackrock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes including there being no agreement in place when the transition period expires these steps many of which are time consuming and costly include effecting organizational governance and operational changes applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the eu and engaging in client communications and are expected to add complexity to blackrock’s european operations in addition depending on the terms of the future relationship between the uk and the eu blackrock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its european operations during the transition period and postbrexit which may impede the company’s growth or impact its financial performance 

reform of investment markets

blackrock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives that may affect the company’s provision of investment services globally in europe the markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated regulation together with certain secondary regulation “mifid ii” the regulation’s requirements generally apply consistently across the eu the mifid ii reforms which came into force in january 2018 are substantive materially changing market transparency requirements enhancing protections afforded to investors and increasing operational complexity for the company new disclosure and reporting obligations have been introduced together with restrictions on how research may be funded and the nature of payments that may be provided to distributors mifid ii together with other market structure reforms force more derivatives to be traded onexchange introduce new commodity derivatives position limits and significantly enhance reporting obligations associated with individual trades the broad nature of the mifid ii reforms impact blackrock’s product development client servicing and distribution models in particular additional disclosures are required to be made in respect of costs and fees blackrock charges to certain of its clients mifid ii also impacts the ability of certain of blackrock’s distribution partners to accept commissions from blackrock for distributing blackrock funds similar reforms have been introduced in switzerland and australia

 

 

eu market access 

 

the european commission and certain eu member states have recently advanced a more restrictive approach to the need for a third country ie noneu country to obtain “equivalence” which is the process by which the legal regulatory andor supervisory system in noneu member states is recognised by the european commission as comparably effective to that in the eu thereby allowing firms established in such noneu member states a degree of access to the eu single market in financial services in addition in 2019 the european commission commenced a review of the alternative investment fund managers directive to assess among other things the effectiveness of regulation on third country fund marketing passports and the continuation of national private placement regimes to the extent the review results in formal legislation that limits the scope of existing permitted activities and eu market access rights for asset management firms with noneu operations blackrock’s ability to access eubased clients may be adversely affected 

 

cessation of libor

the financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates the administrator of the london interbank offered rate libor has announced that it will no longer compel panel banks to submit rates for libor after yearend 2021 as a result sterling libor and certain other indices which are utilized as benchmarks may no longer be published the disappearance or change in the manner of administration of these benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on value of and market for any blackrock investments in instruments and securities linked to such benchmarks blackrock may also face operational challenges adopting successor benchmarks 

revised eu capital requirements for investment firms

in december 2017 the european commission published a proposal for a new directive and regulation on prudential requirements for mifid investment firms the proposal passed the eu legislative process and the final texts of the regulation and directive were published in december 2019 the new legislative package which comes into effect in 2021 will result in changes to the amount of regulatory capital blackrock is required to hold in the eu and how such capital is calculated as well as introduce revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms 

uk asset management market study

the fca has adopted requirements for uk fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer “value” to investors beginning in 2020 blackrock will be required annually to disclose the conclusions of its assessment based upon various factors including cost performance and comparable services if “value” has not been provided to consumers blackrock will need to address any identified deficiencies the fca also requested that the uk’s competition and markets authority “cma” assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets the cma’s final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and the uk regulatory regime will be revised in 2020 to introduce mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services and new standards of disclosure of fees and performance the cma’s remedies could have a significant impact on blackrock’s ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with uk pension fund clients 

macroprudential policies for asset managers 

certain european policymakers continue to raise concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider marketbased finance sector these concerns may lead to macroprudential policy measures being applied to openended investment funds broadly or regulation being introduced that requires changes to the structural features of certain openended investment funds either eventuality could limit blackrock’s ability to offer products to certain clients andor result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to blackrock

senior managers and certification regime

in the uk the fca extended the senior managers and certification regime “smcr” to all financial services firms in december 2019 the regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of uk financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence smcr impacts nearly all staff of the company in the uk and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities 

eu shareholder rights directive

the european commission has revised the shareholder rights directive to enhance engagement between companies and their longterm shareholders the revisions which became effective in june 2019 require investment managers to provide eu institutional investors with enhanced disclosures on shareholder engagement and voting and information on how the manager’s investment strategy contributes to such investors’ medium to longterm performance 

eu sustainability regulation 

in 2018 the european commission introduced a number of regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products require disclosure of sustainabilityrelated information by market participants investments products and issuers and require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors rules arising from the reform proposals will come into effect beginning in 2021

 item 1a risk factors

as a global investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks while blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify measure monitor manage and analyze market operating legal compliance fiduciary and investment risks blackrock’s business financial condition operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties including the ones discussed below 

market and competition risks 

changes in the value levels of equity debt real assets commodities foreign exchange or other asset markets may cause assets under management “aum” revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client numerous factors including price movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests could cause 











the occurrence of any of these events may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

changes in interest or foreign exchange rates andor divergent beta may cause blackrock’s aum and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the company’s net income and operating cash flows

in recent years there have been prolonged periods of historically low interest rates interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates blackrock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates similarly due to the global nature of blackrock’s operations a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar any failure by blackrock to manage movements in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar or its exposure to interest rates may cause blackrock’s aum to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the company’s base fees net income and operating cash flows 

in addition beta divergence between equity markets where certain markets perform differently than others may lead to an increase in the proportion of blackrock aum weighted toward lower fee equity products resulting in a decline in blackrock’s effective fee rate divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of aum and base fees 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services the advisory or management contracts blackrock has entered into with its clients including the agreements that govern many of blackrock’s investment funds provide investors or in some cases the independent directors of applicable investment funds with significant latitude to terminate such contracts withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty or to remove blackrock as a fund’s investment advisor or equivalent blackrock also manages its us mutual funds closedend and exchangetraded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors a majority of whom are independent from the company blackrock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors in addition if a number of blackrock’s clients terminate their contracts or otherwise remove blackrock from its advisory roles liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms the fees or carried interest blackrock earns could be reduced which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause aum in similar blackrock products to decline irrespective of blackrock’s performance 

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by blackrock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar blackrock products irrespective of the performance of such products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

increased competition may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the investment management industry is highly competitive and blackrock competes based on a number of factors including investment performance its technology and portfolio construction offerings the level of fees charged the quality and breadth of services and products provided name recognition and reputation and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors in addition the introduction of new technologies as well as regulatory changes have altered the competitive landscape for investment managers which may lead to additional fee compression or require blackrock to spend more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with products and services offered by other financial institutions technology companies trading advisory or asset management firms increased competition on the basis of any of these factors including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

 

 

failure to maintain aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the sophisticated risk analytics portfolio management trade execution and investment operations that blackrock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and aladdin clients are important elements of blackrock’s competitive success aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management trading and operations tools on a single platform increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions whether due to price competition perceived client market share platform flexibility or marketbased or regulatory factors may weaken aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the company’s revenue and earnings to decline in addition to the extent that aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than blackrock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings blackrock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share which may impede its productivity and growth moreover although blackrock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in aladdin  

blackrock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose blackrock to reputational harm additional costs or operational risk  

blackrock’s financial performance depends in part on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry respond to evolving client demands and develop market and manage new investment products and services conversely the development and introduction of new products and services including the creation of products with a focus on environmental social and governance “esg” matters requires continued innovative effort on the part of blackrock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that blackrock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timescale they require any failure to develop new products and services or successfully manage associated operational risks could harm blackrock’s reputation and expose the company to additional costs which may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

changes in the value of seed and coinvestments that blackrock owns could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings 

at december 31 2019 blackrock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately 27 billion in its investments see “item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsinvestments” primarily resulted from coinvestments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or other alternative investments could lower the value of these investments as well as other minority investments increase the volatility of blackrock’s earnings and cause earnings to decline

blackrock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default 

blackrock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients in the event of a borrower default blackrock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan blackrock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered where the collateral is in the form of cash the indemnities blackrock provides do not guarantee assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested the amount of securities on loan as of december 31 2019 and subject to this type of indemnification was 210 billion in the company’s capacity as lending agent cash and securities totaling 226 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31 2019 significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged andor increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the company’s revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time or the inability to provide support may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

while not legally mandated blackrock may at its option from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes losses on such support as well as regulatory restrictions on the company’s ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

increased geopolitical unrest and other events outside of blackrock’s control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international regional and domestic markets which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

geopolitical risks including those arising from trade tension european fragmentation unrest in the middle east brexit negotiations and terrorist activity as well as acts of civil or international hostility are increasing similarly other events outside of blackrock’s control including natural disasters pandemics or health crises such as the coronavirus may arise from time to time any such events and responses thereto may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets disruptions to commerce including to economic activity travel and supply chains loss of life and property damage and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets as well as the company’s products clients vendors and employees which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

 

risks related to investment performance 

 

poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the company’s management believes that investment performance including the efficient delivery of beta is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of aum poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline as a result of 













performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings 

a portion of blackrock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments performance fees represented 450 million or 3 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 generally the company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded a performance fee for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods the volatility of the company’s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the company’s performance fee generating assets in particular as blackrock takes on more advisory assignments for illiquid investments performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multiyear periods than those associated with more liquid products 

failure to identify errors in the quantitative models blackrock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships 

blackrock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions as well as any failure of blackrock’s governance approval testing and validation standards in respect of such models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on blackrock’s business and reputation 

technology and operational risks 

a failure in or disruption to blackrock’s operational systems or infrastructure including business continuity plans could adversely affect operations damage the company’s reputation and cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s infrastructure including its technological capacity data centers and office space is vital to the competitiveness of its business moreover a significant portion of blackrock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas including san francisco new york london budapest and gurgaon the failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of blackrock’s business or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside blackrock’s control including a major earthquake hurricane fire terrorist act pandemic health crisis such as the coronavirus or other catastrophic event or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt blackrock’s operations in any location at which blackrock maintains a major presence could materially impact operations result in disruption to the business or impede its growth 

in addition despite blackrock’s efforts to ensure business continuity if it fails to keep business continuity plans uptodate or if such plans including secure backup facilities and systems and the availability of backup employees are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption the company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline or impact the company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm regulatory fines andor sanctions 

a cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a cyberattack including a phishing scam malware or denialofservice attack or an internally caused incident such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information moreover developments in blackrock’s use of process automation as well as the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex unpredictable or beyond blackrock’s control blackrock’s growing exposure to the public internet as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyberattacks could disrupt blackrock’s operations and result in misappropriation corruption or loss of personal confidential or proprietary information in addition there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available 

 

there have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumerbased companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information and the unauthorized transfer of customer funds as well as cyberattacks involving the dissemination theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties including nation state actors and terrorist organizations blackrock has been the target of attempted cyberattacks as well as the coopting of its brand and must monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption as the failure to do so could disrupt blackrock’s operations and cause financial losses although blackrock has implemented policies and controls and takes protective measures involving significant expense to strengthen its computer systems processes software technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential data breaches inadvertent disclosures increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks and cyberrelated fraud there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective moreover due to the complexity and interconnectedness of blackrock’s systems the process of upgrading or patching the company’s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the company as well as for clients who rely upon or have exposure to blackrock’s systems 

in addition due to blackrock’s interconnectivity with thirdparty vendors advisors central agents exchanges clearing houses and other financial institutions blackrock may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyberattack or other information security event including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a thirdparty cloud environment blackrock also routinely transmits and receives personal confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means the company collaborates with clients vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyberattacks however blackrock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information 

any information security incident or cyberattack against blackrock or third parties with whom it is connected including any interception mishandling or misuse of personal confidential or proprietary information could result in material financial loss loss of competitive position regulatory fines andor sanctions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure or unavailability of thirdparty dependencies may adversely affect aladdin operations which could cause reputational harm lead to a loss of clients and impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

blackrock must maintain effective infrastructure including a robust and secure technological framework in order to maximize the benefit of the aladdin platform in so doing it relies in part on certain thirdparty service providers for example aladdin’s data architecture depends on thirdparty providers of technology solutions including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to aladdin’s growth in addition the analytical capabilities of aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into aladdin’s analytical calculations although blackrock has implemented internal controls and procedures and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the aladdin platform there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with aladdin’s size and growth or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities could compromise aladdin’s resilience result in operational difficulties cause reputational harm and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and aladdin clients 

 

continuing enhancements to aladdin’s capabilities as well as the expansion of the aladdin platform into new markets and geographies have led to significant growth in aladdin’s processing scale which may expose blackrock to reputational harm increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational data management cyber and informationsecurity risks

 

the operation of blackrock’s aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities developing testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements these updates and expansion initiatives which have led to significant growth in aladdin’s processing scale frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose blackrock to additional cyber and informationsecurity risks as well as increased execution operational and data management risks if blackrock is unable to manage the pace of or provide the operational resiliency and stability for the expansion of aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale blackrock may experience client attrition reduced business reputational harm or regulatory fines andor sanctions which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

 

in addition the highly regulated business activities of many aladdin clients may expose blackrock to heightened regulatory scrutiny for example the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which aladdin clients are based has required blackrock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client’s home location operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose blackrock to increased operational complexity as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions 

failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause blackrock’s aum liquidity and earnings to decline as well as harm its prospects for growth 

blackrock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force blackrock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives blackrock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt or secure lines of credit or commercial paper backup lines on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions a reduction in its long or shortterm credit ratings or changes in government regulations including tax and interest rates failure to obtain funds andor financing or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds andor financing may cause blackrock’s aum liquidity and earnings to decline curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth 

 

operating risks associated with blackrock’s securities lending program may result in client losses

risks related to human capital 

 

the potential for human error in connection with blackrock’s operational systems could disrupt operations cause losses lead to regulatory fines or damage the company’s reputation and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

many of blackrock’s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the company’s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies although blackrock expends considerable resources on systemic controls supervision technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients counterparties or the company blackrock’s operations are dependent on its employees from timetotime employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems controls policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors these can include calculation errors errors in software implementation or development failure to ensure data security follow processes patch systems or report issues or errors in judgment human errors even if promptly discovered and remediated may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines andor sanctions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

 

fraud the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

although blackrock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks it cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks blackrock is subject to the risk that its employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the company’s controls policies procedures workplace culture or principles persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation which could cause adverse publicity regulatory inquiries fines andor sanctions and may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the company’s ability to plan for the future longterm growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within blackrock the global market for qualified fund managers investment analysts technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive and factors that affect blackrock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the company’s reputation and workplace culture the immigration policies in the jurisdictions in which blackrock has offices the compensation and benefits it provides and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession including the development and training of qualified individuals 

in addition a percentage of the deferred compensation that blackrock pays to its employees is tied to the company’s share price as such if blackrock’s share price were to decrease the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession if blackrock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession the company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted 

risks related to key thirdparty relationships

vendor requires a long termcommitment blackrock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services 

 

blackrock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one vendor to another key contract transfers may be costly and complex and expose blackrock to heightened operational risks any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm as well as financial losses to blackrock and its clients the failure or inability of blackrock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients’ investment management agreements have an adverse financial impact on blackrock products or lead to operational and regulatory issues for the company which could result in reputational harm or legal liability fines andor sanctions and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to blackrock’s exchangetraded fund “etf” platform may adversely affect the prices at which etfs trade particularly during periods of market volatility

blackrock is the largest provider of etfs globally shares of etfs trade on stock exchanges at prices at above or below the etf’s most recent net asset value the net asset value of an etf is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the etf’s holdings the trading price of the etf’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours while an etf’s creationredemption feature and the arbitrage mechanism are designed to make it more likely that the etf’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the etf’s net asset value exchange prices may deviate significantly from the etf’s net asset value etf market prices are subject to numerous potential risks including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange inability or unwillingness of market markers authorized participants settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an etf’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively or significant market volatility although blackrock and other large issuers of etfs are working with market participants to seek to enhance us equity market resiliency there can be no assurance that structural reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion or at all moreover if market events lead to incidences where etfs trade at prices that deviate significantly from an etf’s net asset value or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market investors may lose confidence in etf products and redeem their holdings which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

legal and regulatory risks

blackrock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations including those discussed above challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance in particular violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines andor sanctions temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities reputational harm and related client terminations suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses suspension or termination of investment adviser brokerdealer or other registrations or suspension or termination of blackrock’s bank charter or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation or business and may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline for a more extensive discussion of the laws regulations and regulators to which blackrock is subject and regulated by see “item 1 – business – regulation” 

 

regulatory reforms in the united states expose blackrock to increasing regulatory scrutiny as well as regulatory uncertainty 

in recent years a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the united states and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which blackrock is subject has increased further changes to financial services regulation may arise including in connection with the executive order issued in february 2017 the “executive order” directing the us department of the treasury “treasury” to identify laws treaties regulations and other policies that promote or inhibit certain core principles for financial regulation that may directly or indirectly impact blackrock’s business or operating activities blackrock as well as its clients vendors and distributors have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose while blackrock is or may become subject to numerous reform initiatives in the united states see “item 1 – business – regulation” key regulatory reforms that may impact the company include















 

regulatory reforms in the united states could require blackrock to alter its future business or operating activities which could be costly impede the company’s growth and cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline regulatory reform may also impact blackrock’s banking insurance company and pension fund clients which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to blackrock 

 

international regulatory reforms expose blackrock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny as well as regulatory uncertainty

blackrock’s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the united states and the company may be affected by a number of proposed or fully or partially implemented reform initiatives in emea and the asiapacific region as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty including

















 



international regulatory reforms could require blackrock to alter its future business or operating activities which could be timeconsuming and costly impede the company’s growth and cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline regulatory reform may also impact blackrock’s internationallybased clients which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to blackrock

legal proceedings may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the company certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with blackrock’s activities certain of blackrock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities including the securities exchange commission office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” dol commodity futures trading commission financial conduct authority and federal reserve similarly from time to time blackrock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various us and nonus governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industrywide companyspecific or other investigations proceedings or litigations these examinations inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future if compliance failures or other violations are found cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings andor impose sanctions for violations any such action may also result in litigation by investors in blackrock’s funds other blackrock clients or blackrock’s shareholders which could harm the company’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the company being liable for damages 

in addition when clients retain blackrock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that blackrock must observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose blackrock to lawsuits harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts 

as blackrock’s business continues to grow the company must routinely address conflicts of interest as well as the perception of conflicts of interest between itself and its clients employees or vendors in addition the sec and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts blackrock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues however appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the company fails or appears to fail to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest it may face reputational damage litigation regulatory proceedings or penalties fines andor sanctions any of which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is subject to us banking regulations that may limit its business activities 

blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary which is a national banking association chartered by the occ is subject to occ regulation and capital requirements the occ has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over blackrock’s trust bank being subject to banking regulation may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations in addition as described in “item 1businessregulation” as of december 31 2019 pnc owned approximately 22 of blackrock’s capital stock which may subject blackrock to banking regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc the bank holding company act by its terms does not currently apply to blackrock the federal reserve has taken the position that this ownership interest in combination with certain other factors causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for the purpose of the bank holding company act and that blackrock is subject to banking regulation based on this interpretation of the bank holding company act the federal reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that pnc controls blackrock under the terms of the bank holding company act any such determination if successful would subject blackrock to current and future regulatory requirements under the bank holding company act including the volcker rule that are more restrictive than those the company is subject to under other applicable laws as well as the enforcement authority of the federal reserve which includes the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations any effort by blackrock to contest a control determination by the federal reserve may be costly and complex and may not result in a reversal of such determination 

failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

of note among the various international regulations to which blackrock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels thresholds across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the company the specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions blackrock continues to invest in technology training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions despite these investments the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future any such errors may expose blackrock to monetary penalties which could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about index investing and common ownership 

as a leader in the index investing and asset management industry blackrock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries known as “common ownership” the commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows create stock price bubbles or conversely exacerbate a decline in market prices additional commentary focuses on competition issues associated with common ownership and purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain concentrated industries managed by asset managers with higher consumer prices and executive compensation among other things in the us the ftc over the course of late 2018 held hearings on competition and consumer protection in the 21 st century one of which included a discussion of common ownership the hearings may be the subject of a report in 2020 in the eu the european parliament committee on economic and monetary affairs is expected to publish a report on common ownership and the european commission may do so in 2020 there is substantial literature highlighting the 

 

benefits of index investing as well as casting doubt on the assumptions data methodology and conclusions associated with common ownership arguments some commentators have proposed remedies including limits on stakes managed by asset managers that if enacted into policy measures could have a negative impact on the capital markets increase transaction costs and limit the availability of products for investors this may in turn adversely affect blackrock 

new tax legislation or changes to existing us and nonus tax laws treaties and regulations or challenges to blackrock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate business and overall financial condition 

blackrock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus tax authorities 

in the us legislation has been proposed in the house and senate to enact a financial transaction tax “ftt” on stocks bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions in the eu certain member states have also enacted similar ftts and the european commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of eulevel legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states if enacted as proposed ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s financial results and clients’ performance results 

the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock these challenges may result in adjustments to or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition similarly the company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by blackrock or to specific tax rules to the extent there are changes in tax law or policy or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by blackrock the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and blackrock may suffer financial or reputational harm

united kingdom exit from european union

following the june 2016 vote to exit the european union “eu” commonly referred to as brexit the united kingdom “uk” left the eu on january 31 2020 and entered an elevenmonth transition period during which the uk and ukbased entities will retain the rights and obligations of eu membership 

substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the future relationship between the uk and eu but the uk government has indicated its preference for negotiating a trade deal with the eu before the end of the transition period rather than continuing single market or customs union membership blackrock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes including there being no agreement in place when the transition period expires these steps many of which are time consuming and costly include effecting organizational governance and operational changes applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the eu and engaging in client communications and are expected to add complexity to blackrock’s european operations in addition depending on the terms of the future relationship between the uk and the eu blackrock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its european operations during the transition period and postbrexit which may impede the company’s growth or impact its financial performance 

 

acquisition 

on may 10 2019 the company acquired 100 of the equity interests of efront holding sas “efront transaction” or “efront” a leading alternative investment management software and solutions provider for approximately 13 billion excluding the settlement of efront’s outstanding debt the acquisition of efront expands aladdin ’s illiquid alternative capabilities and enables blackrock to provide individual alternative or wholeportfolio technology solutions to clients

business outlook 

blackrocks framework for longterm value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis blackrocks diversified platform in terms of style product client and geography enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles positioning blackrock to invest for the longterm by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management

blackrock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of aum and in some cases performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client numerous factors including price movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests on behalf of clients could impact blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings 

blackrock manages 38 trillion of equity assets across markets globally beta divergence between equity markets where certain markets perform differently than others may lead to an increase in the proportion of blackrock aum weighted toward lower fee equity products resulting in a decline in blackrock’s effective fee rate divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of aum and base fees 

blackrock’s highly diversified multiproduct platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments blackrock is positioned to provide alphaseeking active index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies in addition blackrock leverages its worldclass risk management analytics and technology capabilities including the aladdin platform on behalf of clients blackrock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe including investors in ishares etfs maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus the diversity of blackrock’s platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments and as client preferences evolve client demand continues for etfs and illiquid alternatives which are two areas of focus for blackrock

the index investing industry has been growing rapidly – with etfs as a major beneficiary – driven by structural tailwinds including the migration from commissionbased to feebased wealth management clients’ focus on value for money the use of etfs as alpha tools and the growth of alltoall networked trading ishares etfs’ growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments including core strategic which includes fixed income factors sustainable and megatrends etfs and precision exposures 

as the wealth management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a wholeportfolio approach blackrock’s retail strategy is focused on creating outcomeoriented client solutions this includes having a diverse platform of alphaseeking active index and alternative products as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings digital wealth tools are an important component of blackrock’s retail strategy as blackrock scales and customizes model portfolios extends aladdin wealth and digital wealth partnerships globally and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk management powered by aladdin 

blackrock continues to invest in technology services offerings which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk effectively serve clients and operate efficiently anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions in 2019 blackrock completed the acquisition of efront a leading endtoend alternative investment management software and solutions provider efront in combination with aladdin  will provide clients with an ability to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform

across blackrock more clients are focusing on the impact of sustainability on their portfolios this shift has been driven by an increased understanding of how sustainabilityrelated factors can affect economic growth asset values and financial markets as a whole as a fiduciary blackrock is committed to helping clients build more resilient portfolios since sustainable investment options have the potential to offer clients better outcomes we are making sustainability integral to the way blackrock manages risk constructs portfolios designs products and engages with companies over the past several years blackrock has been deepening the integration of sustainability into technology risk management and product choice across blackrock and plans to accelerate those efforts

nongaap financial measures 

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” however management believes evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful for both management and investors in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance over time management also uses nongaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented nongaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock’s revenue and expense blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap nongaap measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

management uses both gaap and nongaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance adjustments to gaap financial measures “nongaap adjustments” include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow 

computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows 

1 operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted 

management believes operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time and therefore provide useful disclosure to investors management believes that operating margin as adjusted reflects the company’s longterm ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues the company uses operating margin as adjusted to assess the company’s financial performance and to determine the longterm and annual compensation of the company’s seniorlevel employees furthermore this metric is used to evaluate the company’s relative performance against industry peers as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers

discussion of financial results 

introduction 

the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the company fees are primarily based on agreedupon percentages of aum and recognized for services provided during the period which are distinct from services provided in other periods such fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets additional fundings from existing clients including dividend reinvestment withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on and changes in the fair value of securities held in client accounts foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating nonus dollar denominated aum into us dollars for reporting purposes 

the company also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients primarily to highly rated banks and brokerdealers the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities generally the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed historically securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds revenue in the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand 

investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative andor absolute investment performance in addition to base fees based on aum investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold as such the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of the company’s revenue and earnings the magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products however the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either september 30 or december 31 

the company offers investment management technology systems risk management services wealth management and digital distribution tools all on a fee basis clients include banks insurance companies official institutions pension funds asset managers retail distributors and other investors fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixedrate basis revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights

the company also earns revenue related to certain minority investments accounted for as equity method investments 

operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits distribution and servicing costs direct fund expense general and administration expense and amortization of finitelived intangible assets 









approximately 75 of the company’s revenue is generated in us dollars the company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies primarily the euro and british pound are impacted by foreign exchange rates any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the company’s considerable nondollar expense base related to its operations outside the united states 

nonoperating income expense includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense the company primarily holds seed and coinvestments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including private equity hedge funds and real assets investments generally are made for coinvestment purposes to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes including federal reserve bank stock the company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients 

in addition nonoperating income expense includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds the portion of nonoperating income expense not attributable to the company is allocated to nci on the consolidated statements of income

critical accounting policies

investments 

equity method investments  for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where it is not the pb of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company follows the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity 

blackrock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value therefore under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income expense for investments in investment companies or as advisory and other revenue for certain corporate minority investments which are recorded in other assets since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock’s core business 

 

at december 31 2019 the company had 943 million and 531 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets respectively and at december 31 2018 the company had 781 million and 459 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets respectively

impairments of investments evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information 

 

fair value measurements 

the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements 

changes in valuation changes in value on 5489 million of investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense 342 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 528 million relates to carried interest which will not impact nonoperating income expense at december 31 2019 changes in fair value of 3270 million of consolidated sponsored investment products will impact blackrock’s net income loss attributable to nci on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of consolidated sponsored investment products was 1776 million

goodwill and intangible assets 

the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary openend investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost in addition trade namestrademarks are considered indefinitelived intangibles if they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 

finitelived management contracts which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds investorcustomer relationships and technology related assets that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the company for a specified period of time are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2019 ranged from 1 to 11 years with a weightedaverage remaining estimated useful life of 78 years 

goodwill the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment assessment performed as of july 31 2019 indicated no impairment charge was required the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2019 the company’s common stock closed at 50270 which exceeded its book value of approximately 21615 per share 

 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinitelife and finitelife classifications are still appropriate 

 

in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is less than carrying value blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates in addition the company considered other factors including i macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or other developments in equity and credit markets ii industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the company operates an increased competitive environment a decline in marketdependent multiples or metrics a change in the market for an entity’s services or regulatory legal or political developments and iii the companyspecific events such as a change in management or key personnel overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset if an indefinitelived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs

for finitelived intangible assets if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform a recoverability test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 97 million 50 million and 89 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

in 2019 2018 and 2017 the company performed impairment tests including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments the company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinitelived versus finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

contingent consideration liabilities

in connection with certain acquisitions blackrock is required to make contingent payments subject to achieving specified performance targets the fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated at the time of acquisition closing and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition as the fair value of the expected payments amount subsequently changes the contingent consideration liability is adjusted resulting in contingent consideration fair value adjustments recorded within general and administration expense of the consolidated statements of income cash payments up to the acquisition date fair value amount of the contingent consideration liability are reflected as financing activities with excess if any cash payments classified in operating activities any cash payments made soon after the acquisition date will be classified in investing activities

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services the company enters into contracts that can include multiple services which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct management judgment is required to identify distinct services and involves assessing such factors as whether the promised services significantly modify or customize one another or are highly interdependent or interrelated management judgment may be also required when determining the following when variable consideration is no longer probable of significant reversal and hence can be included in revenue whether certain revenue should be presented gross or net of certain related costs when a promised service transfers to the customer and the applicable method of measuring progress for services transferred to the customer over time many of blackrocks promised services represent a series of distinct services eg investment advisory services in which the associated variable consideration eg management fees is allocated to specific days of service as opposed to over the entire contract term

 

investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the company fees are primarily based on agreedupon percentages of aum and recognized for services provided during the period which are distinct from services provided in other periods such fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows aum represents the broad range of financial assets the company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue for example net asset values  

the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients primarily to highly rated banks and brokerdealers the securities loaned are secured by collateral generally ranging from 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities for 2019 2018 and 2017 securities lending revenue earned by the company totaled 617 million 627 million and 597 million respectively and is recorded in investment advisory administration and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee 

the company receives investment advisory performance fees including incentive allocations carried interest from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds which may vary by product or account and include monthly quarterly annual or longer measurement periods

performance fees including carried interest are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of aum becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period given the unique nature of each fee arrangement contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition significant judgement is involved in making such determination performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods consequently a portion of the fees the company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period at each reporting date the company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized including carried interest these factors include but are not limited to whether 1 the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the company’s influence 2 the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts and 3 the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds 

the company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds the company may be required to reversereturn all or part of such carried interest allocationsdistributions depending upon future performance of these funds carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition 

the company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2019 and 2018 the company had 483 million and 293 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition a portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense if any for these products is unknown see note 17 revenue  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2019 and 2018

fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixedrate basis revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights

distribution and service fees earned for distributing investment products and providing support services to investment portfolios are based on aum and are recognized when the amount of fees is known

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until 1 performance thresholds have been exceeded and 2 management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal

income taxes

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2019 blackrock had 900 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 513 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2019 the company had deferred income tax assets of 175 million and deferred income tax liabilities of 3734 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company 

 

the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard the assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately 282 million and current income taxes payables of 293 million at december 31 2019

in 2014 general and administration expense relating to the reduction of an indemnification asset has been excluded since it is directly offset by a tax benefit of the same amount and consequently did not impact blackrock’s book value in 2015 and 2014 the portion of compensation expense associated with certain longterm incentive plans “ltip” funded or to be funded through share distributions to participants of blackrock stock held by pnc has been excluded because it ultimately did not impact blackrock’s book value compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans which substantially offset this expense are reported in nonoperating income expense 





 

assets under management 

the company’s aum by product type for the years 2014 through 2018 is presented below 

 



 



 

component changes in aum by product type for the five years ended december 31 2018 are presented below 

 



 





 

aum represents the broad range of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue for example net asset value reported aum does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice or assets that we are retained to manage on a shortterm temporary basis 

investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of aum we also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreedupon benchmark or return hurdle on some products we also may earn securities lending revenue in addition blackrock offers its proprietary aladdin investment system as well as risk management outsourcing advisory and other technology services to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions number of users or accomplishment of specific deliverables 

at december 31 2018 total aum was 598 trillion representing a cagr of 7 over the last five years aum growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains net inflows and acquisitions including bkca infraestructura institucional and futureadvisor which collectively added 22 billion of aum in 2015 bofa global capital management which added 806 billion of aum in 2016 first reserve which added 33 billion of aum in 2017 and the net aum impact from the tcp transaction the citibanamex transaction the aegon transaction and the dsp transaction which added 275 billion of aum in 2018 our aum mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range as described below 

 

the company considers the categorization of its aum by client type product type investment style and client region useful to understanding its business the following discussion of the company’s aum will be organized as follows 

 



 

client type 

blackrock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe with a regionally focused business model blackrock leverages the benefits of scale across global investment risk and technology platforms while at the same time using local distribution presence to deliver solutions for clients furthermore our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent   

clients include taxexempt institutions such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans charities foundations and endowments official institutions such as central banks sovereign wealth funds supranationals and other government entities taxable institutions including insurance companies financial institutions corporations and thirdparty fund sponsors and retail investors

 

ishares etfs are a growing component of both institutional and retail client portfolios however as ishares etfs are traded on exchanges complete transparency on the ultimate endclient is unavailable therefore ishares etfs are presented as a separate client type below with investments in ishares etfs by institutions and retail clients ex cluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections 

aum by investment style and client type at december 31 2018 is presented below 

 



 

retail 

blackrock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the investment spectrum including separate accounts openend and closedend funds unit trusts and private investment funds retail investors are served principally through intermediaries including brokerdealers banks trust companies insurance companies and independent financial advisors technology solutions and digital distribution tools are increasing the number of financial advisors and endretail clients using blackrock products retail represented 11 of longterm aum at december 31 2018 and 31 of longterm base fees for 2018 

ishares etfs have a significant retail component but is shown separately below with the exclusion of ishares etfs retail aum is predominantly comprised of active mutual funds mutual funds totaled 4977 billion or 81 of retail longterm aum at yearend with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts “smas” 88 of retail longterm aum is invested in active products 

component changes in retail longterm aum for 2018 are presented below 

 



 



the retail client base is diversified geographically with 72 of longterm aum managed for investors based in the americas 23 in emea and 5 in asiapacific at yearend 2018 





ishares etfs

ishares is the leading etf provider in the world with 17 trillion of aum at december 31 2018 and was the top asset gatherer globally in 2018 1 with net inflows of 1675 billion driving an organic growth rate of 10 the ishares core had net inflows of 1062 billion while ishares etfs outside the core had net inflows of 613 billion ishares equity net inflows of 1128 billion were driven by flows into core funds products with broad developed market equity exposures and factorbased etfs fixed income net inflows of 509 billion were diversified across exposures and product lines led by flows into core treasuries and emerging market debt funds ishares etf multiasset and alternative funds contributed a combined 38 billion of net inflows primarily into commodities funds ishares etfs represented 31 of longterm aum at december 31 2018 and 41 of longterm base fees for 2018 

 

component changes in ishares etfs aum for 2018 are presented below 

 



 



our broad ishares etf product range offers investors a precise transparent and efficient way to gain exposure to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult for many investors to access as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and costefficiently

2 regional ishares etf amounts based on jurisdiction of product not underlying client 

institutional 

blackrock serves institutional investors on six continents in subcategories including pensions endowments and foundations official institutions and financial institutions institutional aum is diversified across product and region 

component changes in institutional longterm aum for 2018 are presented below 

 



 



 

institutional active aum ended 2018 at 11 trillion reflecting 96 billion of net outflows fixed income net outflows of 207 billion reflected several large client redemptions associated with client ma cash repatriation and manager consolidation equity net outflows of 79 billion were from fundamental and quantitative strategies 

 

multiasset products saw continued growth with net inflows of 119 billion reflecting ongoing demand for solutions offerings and the lifepath ® targetdate suite alternatives net inflows of 71 billion were led by inflows into infrastructure private equity solutions and real estate excluding return of capital and investment of 23 billion alternatives net inflows were 94 billion in addition 2018 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives and we raised approximately 13 billion in new commitments which will be a source of future net inflows in total institutional active represented 19 of longterm aum and 20 of longterm base fees

institutional index aum totaled 21 trillion at december 31 2018 reflecting net outflows of 537 billion equity net outflows of 918 billion resulted from client derisking reallocating rebalancing and seeking liquidity in a more volatile market environment fixed income net inflows of 373 billion were driven by demand for liabilitydriven investment solutions institutional index represented 38 of longterm aum at december 31 2018 and accounted for 9 of longterm base fees for 2018 

blackrock’s institutional franchise generated 2 organic base fee growth in 2018 despite 633 billion of net outflows reflecting strength in higherfee illiquid alternatives multiasset solutions and liabilitydriven investment strategies

the company’s institutional clients consist of the following 



 







 

client type and product type

component changes in aum by product type and investment style for 2018 are presented below 

 



 



longterm product offerings include alphaseeking active and index strategies our alphaseeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction in contrast index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index index strategies include both our nonetf index products and ishares etfs 

although many clients use both alphaseeking active and index strategies the application of these strategies may differ for example clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns in addition institutional nonetf index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and typically reflect low fee rates net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

equity 

yearend 2018 equity aum totaled 3036 trillion reflecting net inflows of 152 billion net inflows included 1128 billion into ishares etfs driven by net inflows into core funds broad developed market equities and factorbased etfs partially offset by nonetf index and active net outflows of 852 billion and 124 billion respectively

blackrock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix approximately half of blackrock’s equity aum is tied to international markets including emerging markets which tend to have higher fee rates than us equity strategies accordingly fluctuations in international equity markets which may not consistently move in tandem with us markets have a greater impact on blackrock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate 

 

fixed income 

fixed income aum ended 2018 at 1884 trillion reflecting net inflows of 791 billion ishares etfs net inflows of 509 billion were led by flows into core treasuries and emerging markets debt funds nonetf index net inflows of 402 billion were driven by demand for liabilitydriven investment solutions active net outflows of 120 billion were primarily due to several large institutional client redemptions associated with client ma cash repatriation and manager consolidation 

multiasset 

blackrock’s multiasset team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities bonds currencies and commodities and our extensive risk management capabilities investment solutions might include a combination of longonly portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays 

component changes in multiasset aum for 2018 are presented below

 







multiasset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutionsbased advice with 129 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows and contributed 177 billion to institutional multiasset net inflows in 2018 primarily into target date and target risk product offerings retail net inflows of 29 billion reflected demand for our multiasset income fund family which raised 22 billion in 2018 

the company’s multiasset strategies include the following 









alternatives 

blackrock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing highalpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing our alternatives products fall into two main categories — 1 core alternatives and 2 currency and commodities core includes liquid alternatives offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions funds of funds as well as illiquid offerings in alternative solutions private equity solutions funds of funds opportunistic and credit real estate and infrastructure blackrock alternatives products are described below 

in 2018 alternatives generated 121 billion of net inflows or 151 billion excluding return of capitalinvestment of 30 billion the largest contributors to return of capitalinvestment were private equity solutions credit and real estate net inflows were driven by infrastructure alternative solutions and hedge fund solutions in addition we raised approximately 13 billion of new commitments in 2018 across a variety of strategies led by infrastructure and private equity solutions at yearend we had approximately 24 billion of nonfee paying unfunded uninvested commitments which are expected to be deployed in future years these commitments are not included in aum or flows until they are feepaying

we believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings our highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors

securities lending 

securities lending is managed by a dedicated team supported by quantitative analysis proprietary technology and disciplined risk management blackrock receives both cash primarily for us domiciled portfolios and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements the cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios fees for securities lending for us domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both the value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed the value of the collateral is not included in aum 

outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately 267 billion up from 262 billion at yearend 2017 on average relative to 2017 asset and liability spreads were slightly lower however continued asset gathering in lending products resulted in increased balances compared to 2017

blackrock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality liquidity and interest rate risk management disciplined risk management including a rigorous credit surveillance process is an integral part of the investment process blackrock’s cash management credit committee has established risk limits such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits across many of the products blackrock manages including over all of its cash management products in the ordinary course of our business there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed no such instances individually or in the aggregate have been material to the company to the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded the relevant portfolio will be adjusted to the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers while a risk limit may be waived temporarily such waivers are infrequent 

risk  quantitative analysis 

across all asset classes in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams the risk  quantitative analysis “rqa” group at blackrock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and thirdparty data to identify measure and manage a wide range of risks rqa provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk managementrelated analytical and information requirements where appropriate rqa will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics

systemically important financial institution “sifi” review 

the financial stability board “fsb” working with the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” is considering potential systemic risk related to asset management statements made by these organizations have generally indicated that they are at this time focused on products and activities rather than designation in their approach to the review of asset managers the fsb has indicated that it may develop criteria for designation of nonbank noninsurers in the future to address “residual risks” any measures applied in relation to a global systemically important financial institution “gsifi” designation from the fsb would need to be implemented through existing regulatory processes and procedures by relevant national authorities

in the us the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as sifis the fsoc’s most recent statements generally indicate that it is focused on products and activities rather than entityspecific designation in its review of asset managers the us department of the treasury “treasury” report on asset management issued in october 2017 pursuant to the executive order as defined below also expressed this view in addition in november 2017 treasury made recommendations concerning the process by which the fsoc designates nonbanks as sifis further supporting a products and activities approach to addressing risks in asset management in the event that blackrock is designated as a sifi under doddfrank it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve the “federal reserve”

blackrock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus authorities on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” was enacted as proposed regulations and new guidance are released the company continues to assess the impact of tax reform

in addition certain european union “eu” member states have enacted financial transaction taxes “ftts” which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instruments and derivatives transactions and the european commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of eulevel legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states if enacted as proposed ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s financial results and clients’ performance results 

the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock these challenges may result in adjustments to or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition similarly the company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by blackrock or to specific tax rules to the extent there are changes in tax law or policy or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by blackrock the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and blackrock may suffer financial or reputational harm

 

regulation of swaps and derivatives 

the sec federal reserve the internal revenue service “irs” and the commodity futures trading commission each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures swaps and other derivatives such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts if adopted these limitations could require blackrock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes which could result in additional costs andor restrictions in december 2015 the sec proposed a rule governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies that if enacted would represent a fundamental change in the nature of the secs regulations governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by registered investment companies this proposal has the potential to require blackrock to change or restrict certain investment strategies or practices for some registered investment companies and incur additional costs

jurisdictions outside the us in which blackrock operates have adopted and implemented or are in the process of considering adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could further impact blackrock and the broader markets for example various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require blackrock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject these rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods reporting transactions to central data repositories mandating certain documentation standards requiring the posting and collection of initial andor variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed andor overthecounter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements

in the us certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to doddfrank central clearing and electronic trading venue requirements with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future in the eu central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of blackrock funds and accounts and will continue to be phased in for other types of blackrock funds and accounts over time on march 1 2017 most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared including nondeliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions became subject to requirements in the us eu and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect marktomarket margin payments for certain blackrock funds and accounts initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such marktomarket margin payments these rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading noncleared derivatives for blackrocks clients and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase blackrock’s operational and legal risks

regulation of exchangetraded funds 

as part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years regulators globally are examining the potential risks in etfs including those related to transparency liquidity and structural resiliency blackrock and other large issuers of etfs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to blackrock or at all depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis or any associated structural reforms etf products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions which may require blackrock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the company’s business

in addition in june 2018 the sec issued a proposed rule under the investment company act of 1940 the “investment company act” known as the “etf rule” the etf rule is intended to establish a clear and consistent framework that allows most etfs operating under the investment company act to come to market without applying for individual exemptive orders

volcker rule 

provisions of doddfrank referred to as the “volcker rule” created a new section of the bank holding company act of 1956 the “bank holding company act” that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds including hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds collectively “covered funds” the bank holding company act by its terms does not currently apply to blackrock the federal reserve has taken the position that pnc’s ownership interest in blackrock which is approximately 22 causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for the purpose of the bank holding company act and that blackrock is subject to banking regulation based on this interpretation of the bank holding company act the federal reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that pnc controls blackrock under the terms of the bank holding company act any such determination if successful would subject blackrock to current and future regulatory requirements under the bank holding company act including the volcker rule conformance with the volcker rule may require blackrock to sell certain seed and coinvestments that it holds in its covered funds which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions

securities and exchange commission standards of conduct proposal

in april 2018 the sec published a package of proposed rules and a proposed interpretation collectively the “proposals” intended to improve the retail investor experience and provide greater clarity regarding customers’ relationships with brokerdealers and investment advisers the proposals would i create a principlesbased standard of conduct for brokerdealers and require brokerdealers to act in the “best interest” of retail customers ii “clarify and reaffirm” investment advisers’ fiduciary obligations under the investment advisers act of 1940 the “advisers act” and iii create additional disclosure obligations for brokerdealers and investment advisers to help retail investors better understand relationships with investment professionals the sec also proposed the introduction of an enhanced disclosure regime in addition to certain new compliance obligations for investment advisers that currently apply only to brokerdealers if adopted without change the proposals could increase blackrock’s disclosure obligations impact distribution arrangements between blackrock and its distribution partners create compliance and operational challenges for blackrock’s distribution partners and limit blackrock’s ability to provide certain educational and other services to its clients

 

financial crimes enforcement network proposed rulemaking for registered investment advisers 

in 2015 the financial crime enforcement network “fincen” issued a notice of proposed rulemaking “proposed rule” that would extend to a number of blackrock’s subsidiaries which are registered or required to be registered as investment advisers with the sec under the advisers act the requirement to establish written riskbased antimoney laundering programs and report suspicious activity to fincen under the bank secrecy act of 1970 the “bank secrecy act” the proposed rule would include investment advisers within the bank secrecy act’s definition of “financial institutions” which would require them to comply with the bank secrecy act reporting and recordkeeping requirements if adopted in its current form the proposed rule would expose blackrock to additional compliance c osts

securities and exchange commission rulemakings for us registered funds and investment advisers 

blackrock’s business may also be impacted by sec regulatory initiatives the sec and its staff are engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies in particular in so doing it has adopted rules that include i new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain us registered funds ii enhanced reporting regimes for investment advisers and iii implementing liquidity risk management programs for etfs and openend funds other than money market funds these rules many of which are currently in an implementation period will increase blackrock’s public reporting and disclosure requirements which could be costly and may impede blackrock’s growth 

us executive order

on february 3 2017 an executive order the “executive order” was issued articulating certain core principles for regulating the us financial system and directing the secretary of the us treasury to report on the extent to which existing laws treaties rules regulations and policies promote support or inhibit the federal regulation of the us financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles treasury has issued four reports in response to the executive order the “treasury reports” which include a number of recommendations the majority of which require further legislative or regulatory action in order to be implemented that may affect blackrock’s business or operations blackrock will continue to monitor the potential impact of the executive order as well as the treasury reports and any consequential legislative or regulatory action on its business

money market fund reform

in june 2017 the european commission published new money market regulations the “mm regulations” which took effect in january 2019 the mm regulations are intended to reduce perceived risks of eubased money market products the mm regulations limit the use of constant net asset value money market funds to those holding only government money market instruments and introduce a new category of “low volatility net asset value” money market funds and two types of “variable net asset value funds” all categories of money market funds are subject to reinforced liquidity requirements as well as safeguards such as liquidity fees and redemption gates the mm regulations require fundamental changes to many of the company’s money market funds offered in the eu and may reduce their attractiveness to investors

in the us there is currently legislation pending in congress that would repeal the requirement that institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds float their net asset values it is uncertain whether the legislation will pass congress and become law 

british exit from the eu 

following the june 2016 vote to exit the eu the united kingdom “uk” served notice under article 50 of the treaty on european union on march 29 2017 to initiate the twoyear long process of exiting from the eu commonly referred to as brexit there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the terms upon which the uk will ultimately exit the eu as a result the uk’s relationship with the eu as well as whether an agreement will be reached by the march 29 2019 exit deadline remains unclear moreover the passage of time without a resolution in place has become a source of economic political and regulatory instability blackrock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes including effecting organizational governance and operational changes applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the eu and engaging in client communications these steps many of which have been timeconsuming and costly are expected to add complexity to blackrock’s european operations in addition depending on the terms of the uk’s exit from the eu blackrock may experience organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its european operations postbrexit which may impede the company’s growth or impact its financial performance

mifid ii regime

blackrock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives in europe for example in the eu rules and regulations made under the previous markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” were revised in january 2018 through implementation of “mifid ii” the mifid ii package is made up of a markets in financial instruments directive a markets in financial instruments regulation and a number of implementing and regulatory technical standards in the form of delegated acts made by the european commission following advice from the european securities and markets authority “esma” the mifid ii reforms materially changed market transparency requirements enhanced protections afforded to investors and increased operational complexity for the company in particular mifid ii introduced i enhanced governance and investor protection standards ii prescriptive rules on portfolio management firms’ ability to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes iii rules on the identification and monitoring of target markets for mifid financial instruments by mifid investment firms who manufacture andor distribute such instruments iv enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading v the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives on to regulated execution venues vi the extension of pre and posttrade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments vii restrictions on the use of socalled dark pool trading viii the creation of a new type of trading venue called the organized trading facility for nonequity financial instruments ix new commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements x a move away from vertical silos in execution clearing and settlement xi an enhanced role for esma in supervising eu securities and derivatives markets and xii new requirements regarding noneu investment firms’ access to eu financial markets the industry is continuing to adapt to the implementation of these measures which is having direct and indirect impacts on blackrock and its subsidiaries and has required significant changes to client servicing models as a result the broad nature of the mifid ii reforms may continue to impact blackrock’s product development client servicing and distribution models and will require additional disclosures in respect of costs and fees 

 

blackrock charges to certain of its clients mifid ii also impacts the ability of certain of blackrock’s distribution partners to accept commissions further as market structure reforms become fully embedded these may impact the way that the comp any executes investment decisions for client portfolios and reports on such transactions and could have an impact on general market liquidity 

eu market access

the european commission and certain eu member states have recently advanced a more restrictive approach to the need for “equivalence” which is the process by which the legal regulatory andor supervisory system in noneu member states is recognized by the european commission as comparably effective to that in the eu thereby allowing such noneu member states access to the eu single market in financial services additionally in september 2017 the european commission issued a proposal requiring that all thirdcountry outsourcing delegation and risk transfer arrangements be assessed by esma if enacted the proposal would transfer to esma the ability of eu member states to authorize the outsourcing of asset management activities beyond the eu’s borders while the proposal remains under discussion if enacted it could significantly impact asset management firms with noneu operations including blackrock and it may affect the company’s ability to delegate fund management supporting activity andor costs associated with such delegation

cessation of liboreuribor

the financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor administrator that publishes the rate has announced that it will no longer compel panel banks to submit rates for libor after yearend 2021 as a result libor the euro interbank offered rate euribor and certain other indices which are utilized as benchmarks may no longer be published the disappearance or change in the manner of administration of these benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on value of and market for any blackrock investments in instruments and securities linked to such benchmarks blackrock may also face operational challenges adopting successor benchmarks 

revised eu capital requirements 

eu regulators are considering how to design an appropriate capital regime for nonsystemically important investment firms as the current regime is based upon banking requirements and has not been materially modified for asset managers in december 2017 the european commission published a proposal for a new directive and regulation on prudential requirements for mifid investment firms the new legislative package is expected to come into effect in 2020 once agreed upon by the european council and parliament once implemented any new requirements could result in significant changes to the amount of regulatory capital that blackrock is required to hold in the eu

uk asset management market study

the fca has adopted requirements for uk fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer “value” to investors beginning in 2020 blackrock will be required annually to disclose the conclusions of its assessment based upon various factors including cost performance and comparable services if “value” has not been provided to consumers blackrock will need to address any identified deficiencies the fca also requested that the uk’s competition and markets authority “cma” assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets the cma’s final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and it will consider various remedies in 2019 including mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services and standards of disclosure of fees and performance the cma’s remedies could have a significant impact on blackrock’s ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with uk pension fund clients 

senior managers and certification regime

in the uk the fca is extending the senior managers and certification regime “smcr” to all financial services firms beginning in december 2019 the regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of uk financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence smcr impacts nearly all staff of the company in the uk and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities

reform of european retail distribution rules 

blackrock must comply with retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections overhauling mutual fund fee structures by banning the payment of commissions to distributors and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector the rules were originally introduced in the uk in 2012 and similar rules have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where blackrock operates such as the netherlands and switzerland and are under discussion elsewhere similarly mifid ii contains a ban on certain types of advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers these rules are creating inconsistencies among distribution rules in different jurisdictions and may lead to changes to blackrock’s client servicing and distribution models in particular affecting the fees blackrock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners

eu shareholder rights directive

the european commission has revised the shareholder rights directive “srd” to enhance engagement between companies and their longterm shareholders the revisions which are effective in june 2019 require investment managers to provide eu institutional investors with enhanced disclosures on shareholder engagement and voting and information on how the manager’s investment strategy contributes to such investors’ medium to longterm performance it is uncertain whether regulators throughout the eu will be unified in their approach to interpreting compliance with the srd and any inconsistencies may complicate blackrock’s ability to demonstrate compliance

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks while blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify measure monitor manage and analyze market operating legal compliance fiduciary and investment risks blackrock’s business financial condition operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties including the ones discussed below 

market and competition risks 

changes in the value levels of equity debt real assets commodities foreign exchange or other asset markets may cause assets under management “aum” revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client numerous factors including price movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests could cause 











the occurrence of any of these events may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

rising interest rates andor divergent beta may cause blackrock’s aum and base fees to decline and introduce volatility to the company’s net income and operating cash flows

a number of central banks globally have recently begun increasing interest rates following a prolonged period of historically low rates rising interest rates may among other things i cause the value of blackrock’s aum to fluctuate creating volatility in base fees net income and operating cash flows ii adversely affect the liquidity in bonds and fixedincome products resulting in lower performance yield and base fees iii introduce volatility to or negatively impact the value of blackrock’s markedtomarket investments iv result in investors withdrawing funds from lower yielding products to pursue investments with higher rates of return v lead to blackrock’s private credit clients experiencing difficulties in making higher interest payments which may result in increased credit costs and potential provisions for loan losses and chargeoffs for blackrock’s funds and vi make it more difficult for blackrock’s funds to obtain financing for new investments refinance existing investments or liquidate debt investments which could negatively impact such funds’ investment returns revenues and liquidity in the event that rising interest rates have any such effect it may cause blackrock’s aum and base fees to decline and introduce volatility to the company’s net income and operating cash flows

in addition beta divergence between equity markets where certain markets perform differently than others may lead to an increase in the proportion of blackrock aum weighted toward lower fee equity products resulting in a decline in blackrock’s effective fee rate divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of aum and base fees 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors

failure to identify errors in the quantitative models blackrock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships 

blackrock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions as well as any failure of blackrock’s governance approval testing and validation standards in respect of such models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on blackrock’s business and reputation

blackrock’s infrastructure including its technological capacity data centers and office space is vital to the competitiveness of its business moreover a significant portion of blackrock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas including san francisco new york london and gurgaon the failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of blackrock’s business or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside blackrock’s control including a major earthquake hurricane fire terrorist act pandemic or other catastrophic event in any location at which blackrock maintains a major presence could materially impact operations result in disruption to the business or impede its growth in addition despite blackrock’s efforts to ensure business continuity if it fails to keep business continuity plans uptodate or if such plans including secure backup facilities and systems and the availability of backup employees are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption the company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline or impact the company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm regulatory fines andor sanctions 

a cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a cyberattack including a phishing scam malware or denialofservice attack or an internally caused incident such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information moreover blackrock’s increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex unpredictable or beyond blackrock’s control blackrock’s growing exposure to the public internet as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyberattacks could disrupt blackrock’s operations and result in misappropriation corruption or loss of personal confidential or proprietary information in addition there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available 

there have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumerbased companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information and the unauthorized transfer of customer funds as well as cyberattacks involving the dissemination theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties including actions by terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments blackrock has 

 

been the target of attempted cyberattacks as well as th e coopting of its brand and must monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption as the failure to do so could disrupt blackrock’s operations and cause financial losses although blac krock has implemented policies and controls and takes protective measures to strengthen its computer systems processes software technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential data breaches inadvertent disclosures cyberattacks and c yberrelated fraud there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective moreover due to the complexity and interconnectedness of blackrock’s systems the process of upgrading or patching the company’s protective measures could itself cre ate a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the company as well as for clients who rely upon or have exposure to blackrock’s systems 

in addition due to blackrock’s interconnectivity with thirdparty vendors advisors central agents exchanges clearing houses and other financial institutions blackrock may be adversely affected if any of them are subject to a successful cyberattack or other information security event including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a thirdparty cloud environment blackrock also routinely transmits and receives personal confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means the company collaborates with clients vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyberattacks however blackrock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information 

any information security incident or cyberattack against blackrock or third parties with whom it is connected including any interception mishandling or misuse of personal confidential or proprietary information could result in material financial loss loss of competitive position regulatory fines andor sanctions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

the failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline

in addition a percentage of the deferred compensation that blackrock pays to its employees is tied to the company’s share price as such if blackrock’s share price were to decrease the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession if blackrock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession the company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted

of note among the various international regulations to which blackrock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels thresholds across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the company the specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions blackrock continues to invest in technology training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions despite these investments the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future any such errors may expose blackrock to monetary penalties which could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about index investing and common ownership 

as a leader in the index investing and asset management industry blackrock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries known as “common ownership” the commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows create stock price bubbles or conversely exacerbate a decline in market prices additional commentary focuses on competition issues associated with common ownership and purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain concentrated industries managed by asset managers with higher consumer prices and escalating executive compensation among other things in the us the ftc over the course of late 2018 held hearings on competition and consumer protection in the 21 st century one of which included a discussion of common ownership in the eu there are indications that the european commission’s directorate general for competition may discuss common ownership there is substantial literature highlighting the benefits of index investing as well as casting doubt on the assumptions methodology and conclusions associated with common ownership arguments some commentators have proposed remedies including limits on stakes managed by asset managers that if enacted into policy measures could adversely affect blackrock’s business operations reputation or financial condition

new tax legislation or changes to existing us and nonus tax laws treaties and regulations or challenges to blackrock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate business and overall financial condition 

blackrock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus authorities on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” was enacted as proposed regulations and new guidance are released the company continues to assess the impact of tax reform 

in addition certain eu member states have enacted financial transaction taxes “ftts” which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instrument and derivatives transactions and the european commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of eulevel legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states if enacted as proposed ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s financial results and on clients’ performance results 

the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock these challenges may result in adjustments to or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition similarly the company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by blackrock or to specific tax rules to the extent there are changes in tax law or policy or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by blackrock the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and blackrock may suffer financial or reputational harm

following the june 2016 vote to exit the eu the united kingdom “uk” served notice under article 50 of the treaty on european union on march 29 2017 to initiate the twoyear long process of exiting from the eu commonly referred to as brexit there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the terms upon which the uk will ultimately exit the eu as a result the uk’s relationship with the eu as well as whether an agreement will be reached by the march 29 2019 exit deadline remains unclear moreover the passage of time without a resolution in place has become a source of economic political and regulatory instability blackrock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes including effecting organizational governance and operational changes applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the eu and engaging in client communications these steps many of which have been timeconsuming and costly are expected to add complexity to blackrock’s european operations in addition depending on the terms of the uk’s exit from the eu blackrock may experience organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its european operations postbrexit which may impede the company’s growth or impact its financial performance

business outlook 

blackrocks framework for longterm value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis blackrocks diversified platform in terms of style product client and geography enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles positioning blackrock to invest for the longterm by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management

blackrock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of aum and in some cases performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client numerous factors including price movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests on behalf of clients could impact blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings 

blackrock manages 30 trillion of equity assets across markets globally significant global equity market declines in the fourth quarter of 2018 which reduced blackrock’s aum by approximately 466 billion over that period negatively impacted blackrock’s base fee runrate entering 2019 in addition challenged market performance in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions in 2018 may also impact performance fees for 2019 as certain quarterly and annuallocking funds are below highwater marks entering the year

blackrock’s highly diversified multiproduct platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments blackrock is positioned to provide alphaseeking active index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies in addition blackrock leverages its worldclass risk management analytics and technology capabilities including the aladdin platform on behalf of clients blackrock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe including investors in ishares etfs maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus the diversity of blackrock’s platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments and as client preferences evolve client demand continues for etfs and illiquid alternatives which are two areas of focus for blackrock

the index investing industry has been growing rapidly – with etfs as a major beneficiary – driven by structural tailwinds including the migration from commissionbased to feebased wealth management clients’ focus on value for money the use of etfs as alpha tools and the growth of alltoall networked trading ishares etfs growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments including core financial instruments and precision exposures and fixed income smart beta  sustainable etfs 

as the wealth management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a wholeportfolio approach blackrock’s retail strategy is focused on creating outcomeoriented client solutions this includes having a diverse platform of alphaseeking active index and alternative products as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings digital wealth tools are an important component of blackrock’s retail strategy as blackrock scales and customizes model portfolios extends aladdin wealth and digital wealth partnerships globally and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk management powered by aladdin 

institutional client behavior was impacted by global market uncertainty in 2018 with many choosing to derisk from equities blackrock’s institutional results will be driven by enhancing blackrock’s solutionsoriented approach deepening client relationships through product diversification and higher valueadd capabilities including illiquid alternatives and leveraging aladdin ’s analytical and risk management expertise 

blackrock continues to invest in technology services offerings which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk effectively serve clients and operate efficiently anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions

nongaap financial measures 

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” however management believes evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful for both management and investors in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance over time management also uses nongaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented nongaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock’s revenue and expense blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap nongaap measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

management uses both gaap and nongaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance adjustments to gaap financial measures “nongaap adjustments” include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow 

computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows 

1 operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted 

management believes operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time and therefore provide useful disclosure to investors 

 



 







 

revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to third parties management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the company’s products blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted the costs related to distribution and servicing costs as a proxy for su ch offsetting revenue 

 

2 net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted 

 



 



 

management believes net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted and diluted earnings per common share as adjusted are useful measures of blackrock’s profitability and financial performance net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted equals net income attributable to blackrock inc gaap basis adjusted for significant nonrecurring items charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow

see aforementioned discussion regarding operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted for information on the pnc ltip funding obligation and restructuring charge 

for each period presented the nongaap adjustment related to the restructuring charge and pnc ltip funding obligation was tax effected at the respec tive blended rates applicable to the adjustments the 2017 noncash deferred tax revaluation benefit of 1758 million and the other income tax matters were primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented a deemed repatriation tax expense of 477 million has been excluded from the 2017 as adjusted results due to the onetime nature and to ensure comparability among periods presented 

per share amounts reflect net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding

3 nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations

aum decreased 3124 billion to 598 trillion at december 31 2018 from 629 trillion at december 31 2017 driven by net market depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange movements partially offset by positive longterm net inflows led by ishares etfs active multiasset and illiquid alternatives and net aum added from strategic transactions

critical accounting policies

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this filing including information regarding the adoption of asu 201409 

consolidation

in the normal course of business the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles the company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a vie or a vre assessing whether an entity is a vie or a vre involves judgment and analysis factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company’s involvement with the entity investments that are determined to be vres are consolidated if the company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which generally exists if there is greater than 50 voting interest see note 5 consolidated voting rights entities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information investments that are determined to be vies are consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary “pb” of the entity

at december 31 2018 blackrock was determined to be the pb for certain investment products that were determined to be vies which required blackrock to consolidate them blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie the company generally consolidates vies in which it holds an equity ownership interest of 10 or greater and deconsolidates such vies once equity ownership falls below 10 see note 6 variable interest entities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information 

investments 

equity method investments  for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where it is not the pb of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company follows the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity 

blackrock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value therefore under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income expense for investments in investment companies or as advisory and other revenue for certain strategic investments which are recorded in other assets since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock’s core business 

 

at december 31 2018 the company had 781 million and 459 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets respectively and at december 31 2017 the company had 816 million and 468 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets respectively

impairments of investments evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information 

 

fair value measurements 

the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements 

changes in valuation changes in value on 4476 million of total investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense 280 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 387 million relates to carried interest which will not impact nonoperating income expense at december 31 2018 changes in fair value of 2835 million of consolidated viesvres will impact blackrock’s net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of consolidated viesvres was 1740 million 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary openend investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost in addition trade namestrademarks are considered indefinitelived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts and investorcustomer relationships which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2018 ranged from 1 to 12 years with a weightedaverage remaining estimated useful life of 65 years 

goodwill the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment assessment performed as of july 31 2018 indicated no impairment charge was required the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2018 the company’s common stock closed at 39282 which exceeded its book value of approximately 20423 per share 

 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinitelife and finitelife classifications are still appropriate 

 

in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is less than carrying value blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates in addition the company considered other factors including i macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or other developments in equity and credit markets ii industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates an increased competitive environment a decline in marketdependent multiples or metrics a change in the market for an entity’s services or regulatory legal or political developments and iii entityspecific events such as a change in management or key personnel overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset if an indefinitelived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs

for finitelived intangible assets if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform a recoverability test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 50 million 89 million and 99 million for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

in 2018 2017 and 2016 the company performed impairment tests including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments the company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinitelived versus finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles were required the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

 

contingent consideration liabilities 

in connection with certain acquisitions blackrock is required to make contingent payments subject to achieving specified performance targets the fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated at the time of acquisition closing and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition as the fair value of the expected payments amount subsequently change the contingent consideration liability is adjusted resulting in contingent consideration fair value adjustments recorded within general and administration expense of the consolidated statements of income cash payments up to the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration liability are reflected as financing activities with excess if any cash payments classified in operating activities any cash payments made soon after the acquisition date will be classified in investing activities

income taxes

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2018 blackrock had 795 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 462 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2018 the company had deferred income tax assets of 163 million and deferred income tax liabilities of 3571 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company 

the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard the assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately 282 million and current income taxes payables of 341 million at december 31 2018

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services the company enters into contracts that can include multiple services which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct management judgment is required to identify distinct services and involves assessing such factors as whether the promised services significantly modify or customize one another or are highly interdependent or interrelated management judgment may be also required when determining the following when variable consideration is no longer probable of significant reversal and hence can be included in revenue whether certain revenue should be presented gross or net of certain related costs when a promised service transfers to the customer and the applicable method of measuring progress for services transferred to the customer over time many of blackrocks promised services represent a series of distinct services eg investment advisory services in which the associated variable consideration eg management fees is allocated to specific days of service as opposed to over the entire contract term

investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the company fees are primarily based on agreedupon percentages of aum and recognized for services provided during the period which are distinct from services provided in other periods such fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows aum represents the broad range of financial assets the company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue for example net asset value 

the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients primarily to highly rated banks and brokerdealers the securities loaned are secured by collateral generally ranging from 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities for 2018 2017 and 2016 securities lending revenue earned by the company totaled 627 million 597 million and 579 million respectively and is recorded in investment advisory administration and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee 

the company receives investment advisory performance fees including incentive allocations carried interest from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds which may vary by product or account and include monthly quarterly annual or longer measurement periods

 

 

performance fees including carried interest are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the amount of aum becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period given the unique nature of each fee arrangement contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition significant judgement is involved in making such determination performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods consequently a portion of the fees the company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period at each reporting date the company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized including carried interest these factors include but are not limited to whether 1 the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the company’s in fluence 2 the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts and 3 the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds 

the company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds the company may be required to reversereturn all or part of such carried interest allocationsdistributions depending upon future performance of these funds therefore carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investmentsinvestments of consolidated vies or cashcash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition 

the company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2018 and 2017 the company had 293 million and 219 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilitiesother liabilities of consolidated vies on the consolidated statements of financial condition a portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense if any for these products is unknown see note 15  revenue in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2018 and 2017

fees earned for technology services are recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixedrate basis 

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until 1 performance thresholds have been exceeded and 2 management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal

distribution and service fees represent fees earned for distributing investment products and for providing other support services to investment portfolios are based on net asset values and are recognized when the amount of fees is known

interestratecredit spread risk at december 31 2018 the company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately 1540 million of total investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments in the aggregate would result in a decrease or increase of approximately 39 million in the carrying value of such investments 

foreign exchange rate risk as discussed above the company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes the carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound and euro was 666 million at december 31 2018 a 10 adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a 666 million decline in the carrying value of such investments 

other market risks the company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of certain foreign exchange risk movements at december 31 2018 the company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately 22 billion

in 2014 general and administration expense relating to the reduction of an indemnification asset has been excluded since it is directly offset by a tax benefit of the same amount and consequently did not impact blackrock’s book value in 2013 the company made a charitable contribution of the company’s investment in pennymac financial services inc “pennymac” to a donor advised fund the expense related to the charitable contribution was excluded from operating income as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature and because the noncash nonoperating pretax gain directly related to the contributed pennymac investment was reported in nonoperating income expense in 2014 and 2013 the portion of compensation expense associated with certain longterm incentive plans “ltip” funded or to be funded through share distributions to participants of blackrock stock held by pnc has been excluded because it ultimately did not impact blackrock’s book value compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans which substantially offset this expense are reported in nonoperating income expense

aum represents the broad range of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue for example net asset value reported aum does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice or assets that we are retained to manage on a shortterm temporary basis 

investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of aum we also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreedupon benchmark or return hurdle on some products we also may earn securities lending revenue in addition blackrock offers its proprietary aladdin investment system as well as risk management outsourcing advisory and other technology services to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions number of users or accomplishment of specific deliverables 

at december 31 2017 total aum was 6288 trillion representing a cagr of 11 over the last five years aum growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains net inflows and acquisitions including credit suisse and mgpa which collectively added 269 billion of aum in 2013 bkca infraestructura institucional and futureadvisor which collectively added 22 billion of aum in 2015 bofa global capital management which added 806 billion of aum in 2016 and first reserve which added 33 billion of aum in 2017 our aum mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range as described below

institutional active aum ended 2017 at 11 trillion reflecting 59 billion of net inflows institutional active represented 19 of longterm aum and 18 of longterm base fees growth in aum reflected continued strength in multiasset products with net inflows of 196 billion reflecting ongoing demand for solutions offerings and the lifepath ® targetdate suite alternatives net inflows of 06 billion were led by inflows into infrastructure hedge fund solutions and alternatives solutions offerings excluding return of capital and investment of 60 billion alternatives net inflows were 66 billion in addition 2017 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives and we raised approximately 11 billion in new commitments which will be a source of future net inflows equity and fixed income net outflows were 136 billion and 07 billion respectively 

institutional index aum totaled 23 trillion at december 31 2017 reflecting net inflows of 491 billion fixed income net inflows of 875 billion were driven by demand for liabilitydriven investment solutions particularly in europe equity net outflows of 348 billion were primarily due to lowfee regional index equity outflows as clients looked to reallocate rebalance or meet their cash needs alternatives net outflows of 29 billion reflected outflows from passive currency overlays institutional index represented 40 of longterm aum at december 31 2017 and accounted for 10 of longterm base fees for 2017

product type and investment style 

component changes in aum by product type and investment style for 2017 are presented below 

 



 



longterm product offerings include alphaseeking active and index strategies our alphaseeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction in contrast index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index index strategies include both our nonetf index products and ishares etfs 

although many clients use both alphaseeking active and index strategies the application of these strategies may differ for example clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns in addition institutional nonetf index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and typically reflect low fee rates net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

equity 

yearend 2017 equity aum totaled 3372 trillion reflecting net inflows of 1301 billion net inflows included 1744 billion into ishares etfs driven by net inflows into core funds and broad developed and emerging market equities partially offset by nonetf index and active net outflows of 257 billion and 185 billion respectively

blackrock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix approximately half of blackrock’s equity aum is tied to international markets including emerging markets which tend to have higher fee rates than us equity strategies accordingly fluctuations in international equity markets which may not consistently move in tandem with us markets have a greater impact on blackrock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate 

fixed income 

fixed income aum ended 2017 at 1855 trillion reflecting net inflows of 1788 billion in 2017 active net inflows of 215 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings and included strong inflows into municipal unconstrained and total return bond funds ishares etfs net inflows of 675 billion were led by flows into core corporate and treasury bond funds nonetf index net inflows of 898 billion were driven by demand for liabilitydriven investment solutions 

multiasset 

blackrock’s multiasset team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities bonds currencies and commodities and our extensive risk management capabilities investment solutions might include a combination of longonly portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays 

component changes in multiasset aum for 2017 are presented below

 





multiasset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutionsbased advice with 189 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows and contributed 208 billion to institutional multiasset net inflows in 2017 primarily into target date and target risk product offerings retail net inflows of 11 billion reflected demand for our multiasset income fund family which raised 58 billion in 2017 

the company’s multiasset strategies include the following 









alternatives 

blackrock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing highalpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing our alternatives products fall into two main categories — 1 core alternatives and 2 currency and commodities core includes liquid alternatives offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions funds of funds as well as illiquid offerings in alternative solutions private equity solutions funds of funds opportunistic private equity and credit real estate and infrastructure blackrock alternatives products are described below 

in 2017 alternatives generated 10 billion of net inflows or 78 billion excluding return of capitalinvestment of 68 billion the largest contributors to return of capital were real estate and private equity solutions net inflows were driven by infrastructure alternative solutions and hedge fund solutions in addition we raised approximately 11 billion of new commitments in 2017 across a variety of strategies led by infrastructure and private equity solutions at yearend we had approximately 17 billion of nonfee paying unfunded uninvested commitments which are expected to be deployed in future years these commitments are not included in aum or flows until they are feepaying

we believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings as a top ten alternatives provider 3 our highly diversified 1293 billion alternatives franchise is well positioned to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors

securities lending 

securities lending is managed by a dedicated team supported by quantitative analysis proprietary technology and disciplined risk management blackrock receives both cash primarily for us domiciled portfolios and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements the cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios fees for securities lending for us domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both the value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed the value of the collateral is not included in aum 

outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately 262 billion up from 222 billion at yearend 2016 on average relative to 2016 asset and liability spreads were slightly lower however strong market performance and asset gathering resulted in increased balances compared to 2016 

blackrock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality liquidity and interest rate risk management disciplined risk management including a rigorous credit surveillance process is an integral part of the investment process blackrock’s cash management credit committee has established risk limits such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits across many of the products blackrock manages including over all of its cash management products in the ordinary course of our business there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed no such instances individually or in the aggregate have been material to the company to the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded the relevant portfolio will be adjusted to the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers while a risk limit may be waived temporarily such waivers are infrequent 

risk  quantitative analysis 

across all asset classes in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams the risk  quantitative analysis “rqa” group at blackrock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and thirdparty data to identify measure and manage a wide range of risks rqa provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk managementrelated analytical and information requirements where appropriate rqa will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics

regulation

virtually all aspects of blackrock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world some of which are summarized below these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients investors in registered and unregistered investment companies trust and other fiduciary clients of blackrock institutional trust company na “btc” pnc and its bank subsidiaries and their customers and the financial system under these laws and regulations agencies that regulate investment advisers investment funds trust banks and bank holding companies and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers including the power to limit restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters censures and fines both for individuals and blackrock 

the rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical accordingly the discussion below is general in nature does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report 

global regulatory reform 

blackrock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives around the world any such initiative or any new laws or regulations or changes to or in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities lead to business disruptions require blackrock to alter its business or operating activities and expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and legal costs as well as reputational harm blackrock’s profitability also could be materially and 

adversely affected by modificati on of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing banking taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce 

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank” was signed into law in the united states doddfrank is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions many of which have been adopted blackrock has implemented a conformance program to address certain regulations adopted under doddfrank as well as financial reforms that have been introduced as part of the securities and exchange commission’s “sec” investment company modernization initiatives the cost of these conformance activities has been substantially absorbed by blackrock however as certain limited aspects of doddfrank and other rules are still being adopted it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that any implementation of these rules and regulations will have upon blackrock’s business financial condition and operating activities

systemically important financial institution “sifi” review 

the financial stability board “fsb” working with the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” is considering potential systemic risk related to asset management statements made by these organizations have generally indicated that they are at this time focused on a products and activities rather than designation approach in their review of asset managers the fsb has indicated that it may develop criteria for designation of nonbank noninsurers in the future to address “residual risks” any measures applied in relation to a global systemically important financial institution “gsifi” designation from the fsb would need to be implemented through existing regulatory processes and procedures by relevant national authorities 

in the united states the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as sifis the fsoc’s most recent statements generally indicate that it is focused on products and activities rather than designation in its review of asset managers the us department of the treasury “treasury” report on asset management issued in october 2017 pursuant to the executive order as defined below also expressed this view in addition in november 2017 treasury made recommendations concerning the process by which the fsoc designates nonbanks as sifis further supporting a products and activities approach to addressing risks in asset management in the event that blackrock is designated as a sifi under doddfrank the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” is charged with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions and blackrock could become subject to direct supervision by the federal reserve 

taxation 

blackrock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus authorities on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” was enacted over the next few months as the company finalizes the impact of tax reform and clarifies the potential for future investment opportunities blackrock intends to reassess its capital management plans for the balance of 2018 

in addition certain eu member states such as france and italy have enacted financial transaction taxes “ftts” which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instruments and derivatives transactions and the european commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of eulevel legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states in general any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would impact investors and would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that blackrock manages in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products an ftt could significantly increase the operational costs of blackrock entering into on behalf of its clients securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to an ftt which could adversely impact blackrock’s financial results and clients’ performance results

the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock these challenges may result in adjustments to or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition 

regulation of swaps and derivatives 

the sec federal reserve the internal revenue service “irs” and the commodity futures trading commission each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures swaps and other derivatives such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts if adopted these limitations could require blackrock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes which could result in additional costs andor restrictions in december 2015 the sec proposed a new rule governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies that if enacted would represent a fundamental change in the nature of the secs regulations governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies while not on the sec’s current agenda for finalization this proposal has the potential to require blackrock to change or restrict certain investment strategies or practices for some investment companies and incur additional costs

jurisdictions outside the us in which blackrock operates have adopted and implemented or are in the process of considering adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could further impact blackrock and the broader markets for example various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require blackrock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject these rules introduce new requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods reporting transactions to central data repositories mandating certain documentation standards requiring the posting and collection of initial andor variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed andor overthecounter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements

in the united states certain interest r ate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to doddfrank central clearing and electronic trading venue requirements with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future in the euro pean union “eu” central clearing requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of blackrock funds and accounts and will continue to be phased in for other types of blackrock funds and accounts over time on march 1 2017 most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared including nondeliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions became subject to requirements in the united states eu and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect marktomarket margin payments these rules have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading noncleared derivatives for blackrocks clients the new rules and regulations may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase blackrock’s operational and legal risks 

regulation of exchangetraded funds 

as part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years regulators globally are examining the potential risks in etfs including those related to transparency liquidity and structural resiliency blackrock and other large issuers of etfs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to blackrock or at all depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis or any associated structural reforms etf products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions which may require blackrock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the company’s business

 

volcker rule 

provisions of doddfrank referred to as the “volcker rule” created a new section of the bank holding company act of 1956 the “bank holding company act” that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds including hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds collectively “covered funds” the bank holding company act by its terms does not currently apply to blackrock the federal reserve currently takes the position that pnc’s ownership interest in blackrock which is approximately 22 causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for the purpose of the bank holding company act and that blackrock is subject to banking regulation based on this interpretation of the bank holding company act the federal reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that pnc controls blackrock under the terms of the bank holding company act any such determination if successful would subject blackrock to current and future regulatory requirements under the bank holding company act including the volcker rule conformance with the volcker rule may require blackrock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds and to sell certain seed and coinvestments that it holds in those funds which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions

revised department of labor “dol” fiduciary rule

in april 2016 the dol proposed a new regulation defining the term fiduciary for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of title i of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” and the prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the internal revenue code the substantive provisions of the rule began to apply in june 2017 however the applicability date of many conditions of the prohibited transaction exemptions accompanying the rule has been delayed until july 2019 while the dol continues its reexamination of the rule and the prohibited transaction exemptions if the dol does not repeal or revise the rule or revise the prohibited transaction exemptions the rule could require blackrock to revise a number of its distribution relationships create compliance and operational challenges for blackrock’s distribution partners and may limit blackrock’s ability to provide certain useful services and education to its clients

financial crimes enforcement network proposed rulemaking for registered investment advisers

in 2015 the financial crime enforcement network “fincen” issued a notice of proposed rulemaking “proposed rule” that would extend to a number of blackrock’s subsidiaries which are registered or required to be registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 the “advisers act” the requirement to establish antimoney laundering programs and report suspicious activity to the fincen under the bank secrecy act of 1970 the “bank secrecy act” the proposed rule would extend to those blackrock subsidiaries captured within the bank secrecy act’s definition of “financial institutions” which would require them to comply with the bank secrecy act reporting and recordkeeping requirements if adopted in its current form the proposed rule would expose blackrock to additional compliance costs

us executive order

on february 3 2017 an executive order the “executive order” was issued articulating certain core principles for regulating the us financial system and directing the secretary of the us treasury to report on the extent to which existing laws treaties rules regulations and policies promote support or inhibit the federal regulation of the us financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles the treasury has issued three of an expected four reports in response to the executive order the “treasury reports” which include a number of recommendations the majority of which require further legislative or regulatory action in order to be implemented that may affect blackrock’s business or operations blackrock will continue to monitor the potential impact of the executive order as well as the treasury reports and any consequential legislative or regulatory action on its business

securities and exchange commission rulemakings for us registered funds a nd investment advisers 

blackrock’s business may also be impacted by sec regulatory initiatives the sec and its staff are engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies in particular in so doing it has adopted rules that include i new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain us registered funds ii enhanced reporting regimes for investment advisers and iii implementing liquidity risk management programs for etfs and openend funds other than money market funds the rules many of which are currently in an implementation period will increase blackrock’s public reporting and disclosure requirements which could be costly and may impede blackrock’s growth 

certain other rules impacting investment advisers and us registered funds were proposed or were under discussion for proposal by the sec’s prior leadership however the sec’s current leadership has indicated that these efforts are not expected to result in any shortterm action in the event the sec moves forward with any such proposals any new rules guidance or regulatory initiatives could expose blackrock to additional compliance costs and may require the company to change how it operates its business andor manages its funds

money market fund reform 

in november 2016 the eu council announced political agreement with the european parliament on certain money market funds reforms that are intended to reduce perceived risks associated with these products the final text was published in the official journal of the eu in june 2017 starting an 18month transition period for existing funds to comply the reforms will limit the use of constant net asset value money market funds to those holding only government debt and introduce a new category of “low volatility net asset value” money market funds with both categories of money market funds being subject to reinforced liquidity requirements as well as safeguards such as liquidity fees and redemption gates they may also reduce the attractiveness of certain money market funds to investors blackrock is evaluating the reforms and potential impact to its existing constant net asset value money market funds 

in the united states there is currently legislation pending in congress that would repeal the requirement that institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds float their net asset values in order to understand the potential impact of this legislation a review of the impact of the 2014 money market fund reforms on financial stability shortterm funding markets issuers and money market fund investors should be undertaken it is uncertain whether the legislation will pass congress and become law 

british exit from the european union 

following the june 2016 vote to exit the eu the united kingdom served notice under article 50 of the treaty on european union on march 29 2017 to initiate the process of exiting from the eu commonly referred to as brexit the outcome of the negotiations between the united kingdom and the eu in connection with brexit is highly uncertain and information regarding the longterm consequences is expected to become clearer over time as negotiations progress the company continues to prepare for a range of potential outcomes in connection with brexit

 

mifid ii regime

 

blackrock is also subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives in europe for example in the eu rules and regulations made under the previous markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” have been revised through implementation of the “mifid ii” package of measures which came into effect in january 2018 and is made up of a new markets in financial instruments directive a new markets in financial instruments regulation and a number of implementing and regulatory technical standards in the form of delegated acts made by the european commission following advice from the european securities and markets authority “esma” mifid ii builds upon many of the measures introduced by mifid and extends investor protection trading transparency clearing and trading venue access and reporting requirements it is expected that the reforms introduced by mifid ii will have significant and wideranging impacts on eu securities and derivatives markets in particular mifid ii introduces i enhanced governance and investor protection standards ii prescriptive rules on portfolio management firms’ ability to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes iii rules on the identification and monitoring of target markets for mifid financial instruments by mifid investment firms who manufacture andor distribute such instruments iv enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading v the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives on to regulated execution venues vi the extension of pre and posttrade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments vii restrictions on the use of socalled dark pool trading viii the creation of a new type of trading venue called the organized trading facility for nonequity financial instruments ix new commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements x a move away from vertical silos in execution clearing and settlement xi an enhanced role for esma in supervising eu securities and derivatives markets and xii new requirements regarding noneu investment firms’ access to eu financial markets implementation of these measures will have direct and indirect impacts on blackrock and its subsidiaries and may require significant changes to client servicing models a significant number of the impacts are yet to be determined because mifid ii contains a wide ranging and complex set of measures the broad nature of the mifid ii reforms may impact blackrock’s product development client servicing and distribution models in particular additional disclosures are required in respect of costs and fees blackrock charges to certain of its clients mifid ii may also impact the ability of certain of blackrock’s distribution partners to accept commissions further market structure reforms may impact the way that the company executes investment decisions for client portfolios and reports on such transactions and could have an impact on general market liquidity

eu market access

the european commission and certain eu member states have recently advanced a more restrictive approach to the need for “equivalence” which is the process by which the legal regulatory andor supervisory system in noneu member states is recognized by the european commission as comparably effective to that in the eu thereby allowing such noneu member states access to the eu single market in financial services additionally in september 2017 the european commission issued a proposal to enhance the european supervisory authorities’ powers by requiring that all third country outsourcing delegation and risk transfer arrangements be assessed by esma if enacted the proposal would transfer to esma the ability of eu member states to authorize the outsourcing of asset management activities beyond the eu’s borders the proposal could have a significant impact on asset management firms with operations based outside of the eu including blackrock and it may affect the company’s ability to delegate fund management andor costs associated with such delegation

undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities 

the eu has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” the latest initiative in this area ucits v seeks to align the ucits depositary regime ucits remuneration rules and regulators’ power to sanction for breaches of the ucits directive with the requirements of the alternative investment fund managers directive ucits v came into effect in march 2016 with further implementing measures commencing in october 2016 compliance with the updated ucits directive subjects blackrock to additional expenses associated with new depositary oversight and other organizational requirements 

eu benchmarks regulation 

political agreement on the eu benchmarks regulation was reached at the end of 2015 the regulation provides the legislative framework to implement the 2013 international organization of securities commissions principles for financial benchmarks the scope of the regulation is broad as it includes submissionbased benchmarks through to transactionbased market indices proportionality is applied to create a stricter framework for the systemically relevant benchmarks such as the london interbank offered rate libor and the euro interbank offered rate euribor although the regulation creates a number of obligations on administrators of and submitters to benchmarks it is less extensive with respect to obligations on users of benchmarks such as asset managers the regulation formalizes due diligence procedures for users and imposes other additional administrative requirements of users of thirdparty benchmarks managers using thirdparty andor bespoke benchmarks to assess fund performance are also subject to the regulation the regulation came into effect in january 2018 imposing additional administrative and due diligence requirements on the company the burden of which is likely to increase as blackrock makes additional enhancements to its indexing business

revised eu capital requirements 

eu regulators are considering how to design an appropriate capital regime for nonsystemically important investment firms as the current regime is based upon banking requirements and has not been materially modified for asset managers in december 2017 the european commission published a legislative proposal addressed to the european parliament and council for a new directive and new regulation on prudential requirements for mifid investment firms the new legislative package is currently expected to come into effect in 2020 following agreement between the european council and parliament once implemented any new requirements could result in significant changes to the methodology used to determine the amount of regulatory capital that blackrock is required to hold in the eu

reform of european retail distribution rules 

blackrock must also comply with retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections overhauling mutual fund fee structures by banning the payment of commissions to distributors and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector the rules were originally introduced in the united kingdom in 2012 and similar rules have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where blackrock operates such as the netherlands and are under discussion elsewhere similarly mifid ii contains a ban on certain types of advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers these rules will lead to greater fragmentation of distribution rules and may lead to changes to blackrock’s client servicing and distribution models in particular affecting the fees blackrock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners 

revised retail consumer disclosure requirements

 item 1a risk factors 

as a global investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks while blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify measure monitor manage and analyze market operating legal compliance fiduciary and investment risks blackrock’s business financial condition operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties including the ones discussed below 

market and competition risks 

changes in the value levels of equity debt real assets commodities foreign exchange or other asset markets may cause assets under management “aum” revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client numerous factors including price movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests could cause 











the occurrence of any of these events may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services the advisory or management contracts blackrock has entered into with its clients including the agreements that govern many of blackrock’s investment funds provide investors or in some cases the independent directors of private investment funds with significant latitude to terminate such contracts withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty or to remove blackrock as a fund’s investment advisor or equivalent blackrock also manages its us mutual funds closedend and exchangetraded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors a majority of whom are independent from the company blackrock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors in addition if a number of blackrock’s clients terminate their contracts remove blackrock from advisory roles liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms the fees or carried interest blackrock earns could be reduced which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

increased competition may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry blackrock competes based on a number of factors including investment performance the level of fees charged the quality and diversity of services and products provided name recognition and reputation and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors in addition the introduction of new technologies as well as regulatory changes have altered the competitive landscape for investment managers which may lead to fee compression or require blackrock to spend more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with products and services offered by other financial institutions technology companies trading advisory or asset management firms increased competition on the basis of any of these factors including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure to maintain aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the sophisticated risk analytics that blackrock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and aladdin clients are an important element of blackrock’s competitive success aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management trading and operations tools on a single platform increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions whether due to price competition perceived client market share platform flexibility or marketbased or regulatory factors may weaken aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the company’s revenue and earnings to decline in addition there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in aladdin 

the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause aum in similar blackrock products to decline irrespective of blackrock’s performance 

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by blackrock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar blackrock products irrespective of the performance of such products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

changes in the value of seed and coinvestments that blackrock owns could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings 

at december 31 2017 blackrock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately 21 billion in its investments see “item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsinvestments and investments of consolidated vies” primarily resulted from coinvestments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or other alternative investments could lower the value of these investments as well as other minority investments increase the volatility of blackrock’s earnings and cause earnings to decline

operating risks associated with blackrock’s securities lending program may result in client losses 

blackrock lends securities to banks and brokerdealers on behalf of certain of its clients in these securities lending transactions the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral blackrock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks the failure of blackrock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs separate from the risks of collateral investments and blackrock may be held liable for any failure to manage any such risks 

blackrock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default 

blackrock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients in the event of a borrower default blackrock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan blackrock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered where the collateral is in the form of cash the indemnities blackrock provides do not guarantee assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested the amount of securities on loan as of december 31 2017 and subject to indemnification was 200 billion blackrock held as agent cash and securities totaling 214 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31 2017 significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged andor increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the company’s revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time or the inability to provide support may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

while not legally mandated blackrock may at its option from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes losses on such support as well as regulatory restrictions on the company’s ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international regional and domestic markets which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism and acts of civil or international hostility both within the united states and abroad as well as heightened security measures in response to these types of acts may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets loss of life property damage disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity global unrest or conflict or acts of terror as well as any changes in the current geopolitical environment may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets and cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

risks related to investment performance 

 

poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the company’s management believes that investment performance including the efficient delivery of beta is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of aum poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline as a result of 













performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings 

a portion of blackrock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments performance fees represented 594 million or 5 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2017 generally the company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement pursuant to which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded a performance fee for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on 

cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods the volatility of the company’s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the company’s performance fee generating assets in particular as blackrock takes on more advisory assignments for illiquid investments performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multiyear periods than those associated with more liquid products 

failure to identify errors in the quantitative models blackrock utilizes to manage its business could adversely impact product performance and client relationships 

blackrock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions and allocations including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on blackrock’s business and reputation 

technology and operational risks 

a failure in blackrock’s operational systems or infrastructure including business continuity plans could disrupt operations damage the company’s reputation and cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s infrastructure including its technological capacity data centers and office space is vital to the competitiveness of its business moreover a significant portion of blackrock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas including san francisco new york london and gurgaon the failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of blackrock’s business or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside blackrock’s control including a major earthquake hurricane fire terrorist act pandemic or other catastrophic event in any location at which blackrock maintains a major presence could materially impact operations result in disruption to the business or impede its growth in addition despite blackrock’s efforts to ensure business continuity if it fails to keep business continuity plans uptodate or if such plans including secure backup facilities and systems and the availability of backup employees are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption the company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline or impact the company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm regulatory fines andor sanctions 

a cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a cyberattack including a phishing scam virus or denialofservice attack or an internally caused incident such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information moreover blackrock’s increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex unpredictable or beyond blackrock’s control blackrock’s growing exposure to the public internet as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyberattacks could disrupt blackrock’s operations and result in misappropriation corruption or loss of personal confidential or proprietary information in addition there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available

there have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumerbased companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information as well as cyberattacks involving the dissemination theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties including actions by terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments blackrock has been the target of attempted cyberattacks as well as the coopting of its brand to create fraudulent websites and must monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption as the failure to do so could disrupt blackrock’s operations and cause financial losses although blackrock takes protective measures and endeavors to strengthen its computer systems software technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential cyberattacks there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective moreover due to the complexity and interconnectedness of blackrock’s systems the process of upgrading or patching the company’s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the company as well as for clients who rely upon or have exposure to blackrock’s systems

in addition due to blackrock’s interconnectivity with thirdparty vendors advisors central agents exchanges clearing houses and other financial institutions blackrock may be adversely affected if any of them are subject to a successful cyberattack or other information security event including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a thirdparty cloud environment blackrock also routinely transmits and receives personal confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means the company collaborates with clients vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyberattacks however blackrock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information 

any information security incident or cyberattack against blackrock or third parties with whom it is connected including any interception mishandling or misuse of personal confidential or proprietary information could result in material financial loss loss of competitive position regulatory fines andor sanctions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure or unavailability of thirdparty dependencies may adversely affect aladdin operations and could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

blackrock relies on its ability to maintain a robust and secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the aladdin platform the analytical capabilities of aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into aladdin 

analytical calculations the failure of these third parties to provide such data or information or disruption of such information flows could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and aladdin c lients 

continuing enhancements to aladdin’s capabilities as well as the expansion of blackrock’s aladdin platform into new markets and geographies may expose blackrock to heightened cyber and informationsecurity operational and data management risks

the operation of blackrock’s aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities developing new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies including to address client or regulatory requirements these activities may expose blackrock to additional cyber and informationsecurity risks as well as increased execution operational and data management risks particularly in new geographies and markets in addition the highly regulated business activities of many aladdin clients may indirectly expose blackrock to heightened regulatory scrutiny for example the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which aladdin clients are based has required blackrock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client’s home location operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose blackrock to increased operational and information security risks as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions any failure by blackrock to manage or mitigate risks related to enhancing or expanding its aladdin platform may lead to client attrition reduced business reputational harm or regulatory fines andor sanctions which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause blackrock’s aum liquidity and earnings to decline as well as harm its prospects for growth 

blackrock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors including its ability to maintain and grow its aum creditworthiness and operating cash flows failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force blackrock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives blackrock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt or secure lines of credit or commercial paper backup lines on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions a reduction in its long or shortterm credit ratings or changes in government regulations including tax and interest rates failure to obtain funds andor financing or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds andor financing may cause blackrock’s aum liquidity and earnings to decline curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth 

blackrock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose blackrock to additional costs or operational risk  

blackrock’s financial performance depends in part on its ability to develop market and manage new investment products and services the development and introduction of new products and services require continued innovative efforts on the part of blackrock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements a failure to successfully manage these risks may have an adverse impact on blackrock’s reputation or cause the company’s costs to fluctuate which may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

inorganic transactions may harm the company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful 

blackrock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings increase product offerings access new clients leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies inorganic strategies have included hiring smallersized investment teams making minority investments in early to midstage technological and other ventures and acquiring investment management businesses and other small and mediumsized companies or divisions of companies inorganic transactions involve a number of financial accounting tax regulatory geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties including in some cases the assumption of preexisting liabilities any failure to identify and mitigate these risks through due diligence and indemnification provisions could adversely impact blackrock’s reputation may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline and may harm the company’s competitive position in the investment management industry moreover there can be no assurance that blackrock will be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from inorganic transactions 

investments in real assets such as real estate infrastructure and energy assets may expose blackrock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities as well as reputational harm 

investments in real assets including real estate infrastructure and energy assets may expose blackrock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets these may include



















the above risks may expose blackrock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities including costs associated with delays or remediation costs and increased legal or regulatory costs all of which could impact the returns earned by blackrock’s clients these risks could also result in direct liability for blackrock by exposing blackrock to regulatory sanction or litigation including claims for compensatory or punitive damages similarly market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which blackrock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of blackrock’s clients the occurrence of any such events may expose blackrock to reputational harm divert management’s attention away from blackrock’s other business activities or cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

operating in international markets increases blackrock’s operational political regulatory and other risks 

as a result of blackrock’s extensive international operations the company faces associated operational regulatory reputational political and foreign exchange rate risks many of which are outside of the company’s control operating outside the united states may also expose blackrock to increased compliance risks as well as higher compliance costs to comply with us and nonus anticorruption antimoney laundering and sanctions laws and regulations the failure of the company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines andor sanctions which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

 

risks related to human capital

the potential for human error in connection with blackrock’s operational systems could disrupt operations cause losses lead to regulatory fines or damage the company’s reputation and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

many of blackrock’s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the company’s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies although blackrock expends considerable resources on systemic controls supervision technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients counterparties or the company blackrock’s operations are dependent on its employees from timetotime employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors these can include calculation errors errors in software implementation or development failure to follow protocols patch systems or report issues or errors in judgment human errors even if promptly discovered and remediated may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines andor sanctions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

fraud the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

although blackrock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks it cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks blackrock is subject to the risk that its employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the company’s controls policies procedures workplace culture or principles persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation which could cause adverse publicity costly regulatory inquiries fines andor sanctions and may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the company’s ability to plan for the future longterm growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within blackrock the global market for qualified fund managers investment analysts technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive and factors that affect blackrock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the company’s reputation and workplace culture the immigration policies in the jurisdictions in which blackrock has offices the compensation and benefits it provides and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession including the development and training of qualified individuals 

in addition a percentage of the deferred compensation that blackrock pays to its employees is tied to the company’s share price as such if blackrock’s share price were to decrease materially the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession if blackrock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession the company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted 

risks related to key thirdparty relationships 

the impairment or failure of third parties may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages to many different industries and counterparties including distributors brokers and dealers commercial and investment banks clearing organizations mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients transactions with counterparties expose the products and accounts blackrock manages to credit risk in the event the 

applicable counterparty defaults although blackrock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterp arties such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may otherwise fail to meet their obligations any such impairment or failure could negatively impact the perfor mance of products or accounts managed by blackrock which could lead to the loss of clients and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

 

the failure of a key vendor to blackrock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation or business which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration accounting custody market data market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs blackrock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations however to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered there may be few or no feasible alternative vendors available to blackrock in certain areas 

in addition blackrock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one vendor to another for example blackrock is currently in the process of moving custody services on more than 1 trillion of client assets from state street corp to jpmorgan chase  co the migration of which is expected to be complete by the end of 2018 key contract transfers may be costly and complex and expose blackrock to heightened operational risks any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm as well as financial losses to blackrock and its clients the failure or inability of blackrock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients’ investment management agreements have an adverse financial impact on blackrock products or lead to operational and regulatory issues for the company which could result in reputational harm or legal liability fines andor sanctions and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

any disruption to the company’s distribution channels may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution portfolio administration and servicing for certain blackrock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels blackrock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the company’s future performance and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs andor reductions in the amount of blackrock products and services being marketed or distributed moreover new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors business models and more limited product offerings potentially resulting in reduced distribution andor marketing of certain of the company’s products and services and fee compression if blackrock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully if it experiences an increase in distributionrelated costs or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings may decline in addition improper activities as well as inadequate antimoney laundering diligence conducted by thirdparty distributors could create reputational harm to blackrock 

disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to blackrock’s exchangetraded fund “etf” platform may adversely affect the prices at which etfs trade particularly during periods of market volatility

blackrock is the largest provider of etfs globally shares of etfs trade on stock exchanges at prices at above or below the etf’s most recent net asset value the net asset value of an etf is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the etf’s holdings the trading price of the etf’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours while an etf’s creationredemption feature and the arbitrage mechanism are designed to make it more likely that the etf’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the etf’s net asset value exchange prices may deviate significantly from the etf’s net asset value etf market prices are subject to numerous potential risks including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange inability or unwillingness of market markers authorized participants settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an etf’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively or significant market volatility although blackrock and other large issuers of etfs are working with market participants to seek to enhance us equity market resiliency there can be no assurance that structural reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion or at all moreover if market events lead to incidences where etfs trade at prices that deviate significantly from an etf’s net asset value or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market investors may lose confidence in etf products and redeem their holdings which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

legal and regulatory risks 

blackrock is subject to extensive regulation around the world

blackrock may also be adversely affected by its failure to comply with current laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance in particular violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines andor sanctions temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities reputational harm and related client terminations suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses suspension or termination of investment adviser brokerdealer or other registrations or suspension or termination of bank charter or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation or business and may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to 

decline for a m ore extensive discussion of the laws regulations and regulators to which blackrock is subject see “item 1 – business – regulation” 

 

regulatory reforms in the united states expose blackrock to increasing regulatory scrutiny as well as regulatory uncertainty

in recent years a number of regulatory reforms have been introduced in the united states including several that remain proposals or that are at various phases of implementation and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which blackrock is subject has increased in addition there are numerous potential changes to financial services regulation under current consideration including reform and repeal initiatives arising out of or in connection with the executive order issued in february 2017 directing the us department of the treasury “treasury” to identify the extent to which existing laws treaties rules regulations and policies promote support or inhibit certain core principles for financial regulation set forth in the order the “executive order”  that may directly or indirectly impact blackrock’s business or operating activities blackrock as well as its clients vendors and distributors have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose while blackrock is or may become subject to numerous reform initiatives in the united states see “item 1 – business – regulation” key regulatory reforms that may impact the company include

 









 

regulatory reforms in the united states could require blackrock to alter its future business or operating activities which could be costly impede the company’s growth and cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline regulatory reform may also impact blackrock’s banking insurance company and pension fund clients which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to blackrock

 

international regulatory reforms expose blackrock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny as well as regulatory uncertainty

blackrock’s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the united states and the company may be affected by a number of pending regulatory reform initiatives in emea and the asiapacific region as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty including



















 

international regulatory reforms could require blackrock to alter its future business or operating activities which could be timeconsuming and costly impede the company’s growth and cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline regulatory reform may also impact blackrock’s internationallybased clients which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to blackrock

 

legal proceedings may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the company certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with blackrock’s activities certain of blackrock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities including the securities exchange commission office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” dol commodity futures trading commission financial conduct authority and federal reserve similarly from time to time blackrock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various us and nonus governmental and 

regulatory authorities in connection with certain industrywide companyspecific or other investigations or proceedings these examinations inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future if compliance fail ures or other violations are found cause the relevant regulator to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations any such action may also result in litigation by investors in blackrock’s funds other blackrock clients or blackrock’s sharehold ers which could harm the company’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the company being liable for damages 

in addition when clients retain blackrock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that blackrock must observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose blackrock to lawsuits harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts 

as blackrock’s business continues to grow the company must routinely address conflicts of interest as well as the perception of conflicts of interest between itself and its clients employees or vendors in addition the sec and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts blackrock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues however appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the company fails or appears to fail to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest it may face reputational damage litigation regulatory proceedings or penalties fines andor sanctions any of which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is subject to us banking regulations that may limit its business activities 

blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary which is a national banking association chartered by the occ is subject to occ regulation and capital requirements the occ has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over blackrock’s trust bank being subject to banking regulation may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations in addition as described in “item 1businessregulation” pnc owns approximately 22 of blackrock’s capital stock  which may subject blackrock to banking regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc the bank holding company act by its terms does not currently apply to blackrock the federal reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for the purpose of the bank holding company act and that blackrock is subject to banking regulation based on this interpretation of the bank holding company act the federal reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that pnc controls blackrock under the terms of the bank holding company act any such determination if successful would subject blackrock to current and future regulatory requirements under the bank holding company act including the volcker rule that are more restrictive than those the company is subject to under other applicable laws as well as the enforcement authority of the federal reserve which includes the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations any effort by blackrock to contest a control determination by the federal reserve may be costly and complex and may not result in a reversal of such determination 

failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

of note among the various international regulations to which blackrock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels thresholds across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the company the specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions blackrock continues to invest in technology training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions despite these investments the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future any such errors may expose blackrock to monetary penalties which could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock has been the subject of thirdparty commentary citing concerns about index investing and common ownership 

as a leader in the index investing and asset management industry blackrock has been the subject of thirdparty commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries known as “common ownership” the commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows create stock price bubbles or conversely exacerbate a decline in market prices additional commentary focuses on competition issues associated with common ownership and purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain concentrated industries managed by asset managers with higher consumer prices and escalating executive compensation among other things although there is substantial literature highlighting the benefits of index investing as well as casting doubt on the assumptions methodology and conclusions associated with common ownership arguments some commentators have proposed policy measures in connection with the discourse in this area including limits on stakes managed by asset managers if the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers blackrock’s business operations reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected 

new tax legislation or changes to existing us and nonus tax laws treaties and regulations or challenges to blackrock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate business and overall financial condition 

blackrock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus authorities on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” was enacted over the next few months as the company finalizes the impact of tax reform and clarifies the potential for future investment opportunities blackrock intends to reassess its capital management plans for the balance of 2018 

in addition certain eu member states have enacted financial transaction taxes “ftts” which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instrument and derivatives transactions and the european commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of eulevel legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states if introduced as proposed ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s financial results and on clients’ performance results 

the application of complex tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock these challenges may result in adjustments to or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adverse ly affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition

nongaap financial measures 

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” however management believes evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful for both management and investors in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance over time management also uses nongaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented nongaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock’s revenue and expense blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap nongaap measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

management uses both gaap and nongaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance adjustments to gaap financial measures “nongaap adjustments” include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow 

computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows 

1 operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted 

management believes operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time and therefore provide useful disclosure to investors 

 



 





revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third pa rties management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the company’s products in addition management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consi stency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services which due to the terms of the contracts are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue amortization of deferre d sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time substantially offset distribution fee revenue the company earns for each of these items blackrock excludes from revenue used f or operating margin as adjusted the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue 

 

2 net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted 

 



 

management believes net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted and diluted earnings per common share as adjusted are useful measures of blackrock’s profitability and financial performance net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted equals net income attributable to blackrock inc gaap basis adjusted for significant nonrecurring items charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow

see aforementioned discussion regarding operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted for information on the pnc ltip funding obligation and the restructuring charge 

for each period presented the nongaap adjustment related to the restructuring charge and pnc ltip funding obligation was tax effected at the respec tive blended rates applicable to the adjustments the noncash deferred tax revaluation benefit of 1758 million and the other income tax matters were primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill these amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented a deemed repatriation tax expense of 477 million has been excluded from the 2017 as adjusted results due to the onetime nature and to ensure comparability among periods presented 

per share amounts reflect net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding

3 nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations

discussion of financial results 

introduction 

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets additional fundings from existing clients including dividend reinvestment withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on and changes in the fair value of securities held in client accounts foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating nonus dollar denominated aum into us dollars for reporting purposes 

blackrock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and brokerdealers the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities generally the revenue earned is shared between blackrock and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed historically securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds revenue in the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand 

investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative andor absolute investment performance in addition to base fees based on aum investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold as such the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of blackrock’s revenue and earnings the magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products however the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either september 30 or december 31 

blackrock offers investment management technology systems risk management services wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis clients include banks insurance companies official institutions pension funds asset managers retail distributors and other investors fees earned for technology and risk management revenue are recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixedrate basis

blackrock advises global financial institutions regulators and government entities across a range of risk regulatory capital markets and strategic services fees earned for advisory services which are included in advisory and other revenue are determined using fixedrate fees and recorded upon delivery 

the company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a tradedate basis as securities transactions occur 

the company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments 

operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits distribution and servicing costs amortization of deferred sales commissions direct fund expense general and administration expense and amortization of finitelived intangible assets 







general and administration expense includes marketing and promotional occupancy and officerelated costs portfolio services including clearing expense related to transition management services technology professional services communications product launch costs and other general and administration expense including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement foreign currency remeasurement gains losses were 5 million 6 million and 8 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

approximately 75 of the company’s revenue is generated in us dollars the company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies primarily the euro and british pound are impacted by foreign exchange rates any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the company’s considerable nondollar expense base related to its operations outside the united states 

nonoperating income expense includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments excluding availableforsale investments and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to availableforsale investments blackrock primarily holds seed and coinvestments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including private equity hedge funds and real assets investments generally are made for coinvestment purposes to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes including federal reserve bank stock blackrock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients 

in addition nonoperating income expense includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds the portion of nonoperating income expense not attributable to blackrock is allocated to nci on the co nsolidated statements of income

carried interest clawback as a general partner in certain investment funds including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds the company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements the company may from time to time be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements therefore blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in total investments or cashcash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed and as a deferred carried interest liabilityother liabilities of consolidated vies on its consolidated statements of financial condition carried interest is recorded as performance fees on consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable 

indemnifications in the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements blackrock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances the terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability if any cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and therefore has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31 2017 see further discussion in note 13 commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing 

on behalf of certain clients the company lends securities to highly rated banks and brokerdealers in these securities lending transactions the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral blackrock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement at december 31 2017 the company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately 200 billion the company held as agent cash and securities totaling 214 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31 2017 the fair value of these indemnifications was not material at december 31 2017 

while the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement in the event of a borrower default the company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations if the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the company has provided indemnification blackrock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall these indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above and do not in any way guarantee assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested

critical accounting policies

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this filing 

consolidation

in the normal course of business the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles the company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a vie or a vre assessing whether an entity is a vie or a vre involves judgment and analysis factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company’s involvement with the entity investments that are determined to be vres are consolidated if the company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which generally exists if there is greater than 50 voting interest see note 4 consolidated voting rights entities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information investments that are determined to be vies are consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary “pb” of the entity

at december 31 2017 blackrock was determined to be the pb for certain investment funds that were determined to be vies which required blackrock to consolidate them blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie the company generally consolidates vies in which it holds an equity ownership interest of 10 or greater and 

deconsolidates such vies once equity ownership falls below 10 see note 5 variable interest entities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information 

investments 

equity method investments  for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where it is not the pb of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company follows the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity 

blackrock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value therefore under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income expense for investments in investment companies or as advisory and other revenue for certain strategic investments which are recorded in other assets since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock’s core business 

at december 31 2017 the company had 816 million and 468 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets respectively and at december 31 2016 the company had 730 million and 348 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets respectively 

impairments of investments management periodically assesses equity method availableforsale heldtomaturity and cost investments for otherthantemporary impairment “otti” if an otti exists an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income expense on the consolidated statements of income 

for equity method heldtomaturity and cost method investments if circumstances indicate that an otti may exist the investments are evaluated using market values where available or the expected future cash flows of the investment if the company determines an otti exists an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value 

for availableforsale securities when the fair value is lower than cost the company considers among other factors the length of time the security has been in a loss position the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses for equity securities if the impairment is considered otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value for debt securities the company considers whether 1 it has the intent to sell the security 2 it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or 3 it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security if the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value must be recognized in earnings if the company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered an impairment related to credit the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total decline in value and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

 

for the company’s investments in clos the company reviews cash flow estimates over the life of each clo investment on a quarterly basis if the present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows an impairment is considered to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value

evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 

fair value measurements 

the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements 

changes in valuation changes in value on 2878 million of total investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense 103 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income 195 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 298 million relates to carried interest which will not impact nonoperating income expense at december 31 2017 changes in fair value of approximately 1739 million of consolidated viesvres will impact blackrock’s net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of consolidated viesvres was 1419 million 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary openend investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost in addition trade namestrademarks are considered indefinitelived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts and investorcustomer relationships which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2017 ranged from 1 to 11 years with a weightedaverage remaining estimated useful life of 65 years 

goodwill the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment assessment performed as of july 31 2017 indicated no impairment charge was required the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2017 the company’s common stock closed at 51371 which exceeded its book value of approximately 19761 per share 

 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinitelife and finitelife classifications are still appropriate 

 

in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is less than carrying value blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates in addition the company considered other factors including i macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or other developments in equity and credit markets ii industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates an increased competitive environment a decline in marketdependent multiples or metrics a change in the market for an entity’s services or regulatory legal or political developments and iii entityspecific events such as a change in management or key personnel overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset if an indefinitelived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs

for finitelived intangible assets if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform a recoverability test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 89 million 99 million and 128 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

in 2017 2016 and 2015 the company performed impairment tests including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments the company determined that no impairment charges were required the classification of indefinitelived versus finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles were required the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

income taxes

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2017 blackrock had 629 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 316 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2017 the company had deferred tax assets of 19 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately 3538 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company 

the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard the assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately 1 42 million and current income taxes payables of 256 million at december 31 2017 

for further information on the 2017 tax act see note 21 income taxes  in the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this filing

revenue recognition

investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on agreedupon percentages of the net asset value of aum or committed capital investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers 

the company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the company manages such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the fee paid by the fund in certain cases the fund primarily international funds takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the company bears no credit risk to the thirdparty the company currently records its management fees net of retrocessions the company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which due to the terms of the contracts are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income 

the company earns revenue by lending securities as an agent on behalf of clients primarily to brokerage institutions revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis the securities loaned are secured by collateral generally ranging from 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities generally the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or other thirdparty accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed for 2017 2016 and 2015 securities lending revenue earned by the company totaled 597 million 579 million and 513 million respectively and is recorded in investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee 

the company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which varies by product or account and could be monthly quarterly annually or longer 

in addition the company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds blackrock may be required to reversereturn all or part of such carried interest allocations depending upon future performance of these funds therefore blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in total investments or cashcash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable 

the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2017 and 2016 the company had 219 million and 152 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilitiesother liabilities of consolidated vies on the consolidated statements of financial condition a portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue if any for these products is unknown 

the following table presents changes in the deferred carried interest liability including the portion related to consolidated vies for 2017 and 2016 

 



 

for 2017 2016 and 2015 performance fee revenue which included recognized carried interest totaled 594 million 295 million and 621 million respectively 

fees earned for technology and risk management revenue are recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixedrate basis for 2017 2016 and 2016 technology and risk management revenue totaled 677 million 595 million and 528 million respectively

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable 

accounting developments 

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 revenue from contracts with customers “asu 201409” asu 201409 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance the guidance also changes the accounting for certain contract costs and revises the criteria for determining if an entity is acting as a principal or agent in certain arrangements 

the key changes in the standard that impact the company’s revenue recognition relate to the presentation of certain revenue contracts and associated contract costs the most significant of these changes relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs which are currently presented net against revenues contrarevenue and will be presented as an expense on a gross basis the company adopted asu 201409 effective january 1 2018 on a full retrospective basis which will require 2016 and 2017 to be restated in future filings the cumulative effect adjustment to the 2016 opening retained earnings was not material the company currently expects the net gross up to revenue to be approximately 1 billion with a corresponding gross up to expense for both 2016 and 2017 consequently the company expects its gaap operating margin to decline upon adoption due to the gross up of revenue however no material impact is expected on the company’s as adjusted operating margin

see “item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — nongaap financial measures” for further information on nongaap financial measures and for as adjusted items for 2016 2015 and 2014 in 2013 the company made a charitable contribution of approximately six million units of the company’s investment in pennymac financial services inc “pennymac” to a donor advised fund the expense related to the charitable contribution was excluded from operating income as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature and because the noncash nonoperating pretax gain directly related to the contributed pennymac investment was reported in nonoperating income expense in 2012 operating income as adjusted included an adjustment related to estimated lease exit costs initially recorded in 2011 and the contribution to certain of the company’s bankmanaged shortterm investment funds in 2013 and 2012 the portion of compensation expense associated with certain longterm incentive plans “ltip” funded or to be funded through share distributions to participants of blackrock stock held by pnc has been excluded because it ultimately did not impact blackrock’s book value compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans which substantially offset this expense are reported in nonoperating income expense 





 

 

assets under management 

the company’s aum by product type for the years 2012 through 2016 is presented below 

 



 



component changes in aum by product type for the five years ended december 31 2016 are presented below 

 



 







 

aum represents the broad range of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue for example net asset value reported aum does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice or assets that we are retained to manage on a shortterm temporary basis 

investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of aum we also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreedupon benchmark or return hurdle on some products we also may earn securities lending revenue in addition blackrock offers its proprietary aladdin investment system as well as risk management outsourcing advisory and technology services to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries under the blackrock solutions name revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions number of users accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives 

at december 31 2016 total aum was 51 trillion representing a cagr of 8 over the last five years aum growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains net inflows and acquisitions including claymore and srpep which collectively added 137 billion of aum in 2012 credit suisse and mgpa which collectively added 269 billion of aum in 2013 bkca infraestructura institucional and futureadvisor which collectively added 22 billion of aum in 2015 and bofa global capital management which added 806 billion of aum in 2016 our aum mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range as described below 

the company considers the categorization of its aum by client type product type investment style and client region useful to understanding its business the following discussion of the company’s aum will be organized as follows 

 



 

client type 

our organizational structure was designed to ensure that strong investment performance is our highest priority and that we best align with our clients’ needs to capitalize on broader industry trends furthermore our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent   specifically our investments functions are split into distinct strategies active equity and fixed income beta multiasset alternatives and tradingliquidity   

we serve a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe clients include taxexempt institutions such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans charities foundations and endowments official institutions such as central banks sovereign wealth funds supranationals and other government entities taxable institutions including insurance companies financial institutions corporations and thirdparty fund sponsors and retail investors ishares is presented as a separate client type below with investments in ishares by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections below 

aum by investment style and client type at december 31 2016 is presented below 

 



 

retail 

blackrock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the active and passive spectrum including separate accounts openend and closedend funds unit trusts and private investment funds retail investors are served principally through intermediaries including brokerdealers banks trust companies insurance companies and independent financial advisors clients invest primarily in mutual funds which totaled 4430 billion or 82 of retail longterm aum at yearend with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts “smas” 91 of longterm retail aum is invested in active products although this is impacted by ishares  which has a significant retail component and is shown separately retail represented 12 of longterm aum at december 31 2016 and 34 of longterm base fees for 2016 

component changes in retail longterm aum for 201 6 are presented below 

 



 

the retail client base is diversified geographically with 71 of longterm aum managed for investors based in the americas 23 in emea and 6 in asiapacific at yearend 2016 





ishares 

ishares is the leading etf provider in the world with 13 trillion of aum at december 31 2016 and was the top asset gatherer globally in 2016 1 with record net inflows of 1405 billion resulting in an organic growth rate of 13 equity net inflows of 749 billion were driven by flows into the core range and into funds with us and broad developed market equity exposures record fixed income net inflows of 599 billion were diversified across exposures and product lines led by flows into the core range corporate and high yield bond funds ishares multiasset and alternatives funds contributed a combined 57 billion of net inflows primarily into commodities funds ishares represented 27 of longterm aum at december 31 2016 and 36 of longterm base fees for 2016 

component changes in ishares aum for 2016 are presented below 

 



 



our broad ishares product range offers investors a precise transparent and efficient way to tap market returns and gain access to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult for many investors to access as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and costefficiently 





institutional 

blackrock’s institutional aum is well diversified by both product and region and we serve institutional investors on six continents in subcategories including pensions endowments and foundations official institutions and financial institutions 





component changes in institutional longterm aum for 2016 are presented below 

 



 

institutional active aum ended 2016 at 10 trillion reflecting 179 billion of net inflows institutional active represented 21 of longterm aum and 20 of longterm base fees growth in aum reflected continued strength in multiasset products with net inflows of 133 billion reflecting ongoing demand for solutions offerings and the lifepath ® targetdate suite our topperforming fixed income platform generated net inflows of 102 billion diversified across exposures alternatives net inflows of 18 billion were led by inflows into infrastructure and alternatives solutions offerings in addition 2016 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives and we raised 50 billion in new commitments which will be a source of future net inflows equity net outflows of 74 billion reflected fundamental and scientific net outflows of 50 billion and 24 billion respectively 

institutional index aum totaled 19 trillion at december 31 2016 reflecting net inflows of 335 billion fixed income net inflows of 414 billion were driven by demand for liabilitydriven investment solutions particularly in europe equity net outflows of 86 billion were primarily due to lowfee regional index equity outflows as clients looked to reallocate rebalance or meet their cash needs institutional index represented 40 of longterm aum at december 31 2016 and accounted for 10 of longterm base fees for 2016 

the company’s institutional clients consist of the following 







product type and investment style 

component changes in aum by product type and investment style for 2016 are presented below 

 



 



longterm product offerings include active and index strategies our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile we offer two types of active strategies those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction in contrast index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index index strategies include both our nonetf index products and ishares etfs 

although many clients use both active and index strategies the application of these strategies may differ for example clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns in addition institutional nonetf index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and typically reflect low fee rates this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

equity 

yearend 2016 equity aum totaled 2657 trillion reflecting net inflows of 514 billion net inflows included 749 billion into ishares  driven by net inflows into the core ranges and broad developed and emerging market equities ishares net inflows were partially offset by active and nonetf index net outflows of 202 billion and 33 billion respectively

blackrock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix approximately half of blackrock’s equity aum is tied to international markets including emerging markets which tend to have higher fee rates than us equity strategies accordingly fluctuations in international equity markets which may not consistently move in tandem with us markets have a greater impact on blackrock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues 

fixed income 

fixed income aum ended 2016 at 1572 trillion reflecting net inflows of 1200 billion in 2016 active net inflows of 166 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings and included strong inflows from insurance clients fixed income ishares net inflows of 599 billion were led by flows into the core ranges emerging market high yield and corporate bond funds nonetf index net inflows of 434 billion were driven by demand for liabilitydriven investment solutions 

multiasset 

blackrock’s multiasset team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities bonds currencies and commodities and our extensive risk management capabilities investment solutions might include a combination of longonly portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays 

component changes in multiasset aum for 2016 are presented below

 





multiasset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutionsbased advice with 132 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows a nd contributed 113 billion to institutional multiasset net inflows in 2016 primarily into target date and target risk product offerings retail net outflows of 94 billion were primarily due to outflows from world allocation strategies 

the company’s multiasset strategies include the following 









alternatives 

blackrock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing highalpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing our alternatives products fall into two main categories — 1 core alternatives and 2 currency and commodities core includes alternative solutions direct hedge funds hedge fund and private equity solutions funds of funds opportunistic private equity and credit real estate and infrastructure offerings blackrock alternatives products are described below 

in 2016 alternatives generated 50 billion of net inflows driven by net inflows into currency and commodities and infrastructure blackrock returned 61 billion of capital to investors upon the completion of investment periods which is included in outflows the largest contributors to return of capital were real estate and private equity solutions in addition we raised 50 billion of new commitments in 2016 across a variety of strategies including private equity solutions hedge fund solutions opportunistic credit alternative solutions real estate and infrastructure at yearend we had 108 billion of nonfee paying unfunded uninvested commitments which are expected to be deployed in future years these commitments are not included in aum or flows until they are invested

we believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings as a top ten alternative provider 3 our highly diversified 1169 billion alternatives franchise is well positioned to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors 

 

component changes in alternatives aum for 2016 are presented in the table below

securities lending 

securities lending is managed by a dedicated team supported by quantitative analysis proprietary technology and disciplined risk management blackrock receives both cash primarily for us domiciled portfolios and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements the cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios fees for securities lending for us domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both the value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed the value of the collateral is not included in aum 

outstanding loan balanc es end ed the year at approximately  222 billion up from  218 billion at ye arend 201 5  on average l iability spreads were slightly lower compared to 2015 levels  

blackrock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality liquidity and interest rate risk management disciplined risk management including a rigorous credit surveillance process is an integral part of the investment process blackrock’s cash management credit committee has established risk limits such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits across many of the products blackrock manages including over all of its cash management products in the ordinary course of our business there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed no such instances individually or in the aggregate have been material to the company to the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded the relevant portfolio will be adjusted to the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers while a risk limit may be waived temporarily such waivers are infrequent 

risk  quantitative analysis 

across all asset classes in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams the risk  quantitative analysis “rqa” group at blackrock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and thirdparty data to identify measure and manage a wide range of risks rqa provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk managementrelated analytical and information requirements where appropriate rqa will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics 

 

 

competition 

blackrock competes with investment management firms mutual fund complexes insurance companies banks brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to or alternatives to those offered by blackrock in order to grow its business blackrock must be able to compete effectively for aum key competitive factors include investment performance track records the efficient delivery of beta for index products investment style and discipline client service and brand name recognition historically the company has competed principally on the basis of its longterm investment performance track record its investment process its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service

regulation 

virtually all aspects of blackrock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world some of which are summarized below these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients investors in registered and unregistered investment companies trust clients of blackrock institutional trust company na “btc” pnc and its bank subsidiaries and their customers and the financial system under these laws and regulations agencies that regulate investment advisers investment funds and bank holding companies and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers including the power to limit restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters censures and fines both for individuals and blackrock 

the rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical accordingly the discussion below is general in nature does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report 

global regulatory reform 

blackrock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives around the world any such initiative or any new laws or regulations or changes to or in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities lead to business disruptions require blackrock to alter its business or operating activities and expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and legal costs as well as reputational harm blackrock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing banking taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce 

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank” was signed into law in the united states doddfrank is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions many of which have been adopted blackrock has commenced a conformance program to address certain regulations adopted under doddfrank as well as financial reforms that have been introduced as part of the securities and exchange commission’s “sec” investment company modernization initiatives the cost of these conformance activities has been absorbed by blackrock however as the full extent of doddfrank and other 

rules will only become evident over time it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that doddfrank or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions will have upon blackrock’s bu siness financial condition and operating activities 

systemically important financial institution “sifi” review 

both the financial stability board “fsb” working with the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” and the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” are considering potential systemic risk related to asset management statements made by these organizations have generally indicated that they are at this time focused on a products and activities rather than designation approach in their review of asset managers this sentiment was most recently reiterated in the fsb’s final policy recommendations to address structural vulnerabilities from asset management activities released in january 2017 which continues to concentrate primarily on products and activities and includes 14 recommendations largely focused on liquidity in openend funds leverage in funds operational risk and securities lending certain of which iosco is expected to engage on in the future 

the fsb has indicated that it may develop criteria for designation of nonbank noninsurers in the future to address “residual risks” any measures applied in relation to a global systemically important financial institution “gsifi” designation from the fsb would need to be implemented through existing regulatory processes and procedures by relevant national authorities in the united states the fsoc has not indicated whether or not it intends to designate any asset managers as sifis in the event that blackrock receives a sifi designation under doddfrank the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” is charged with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions and blackrock could become subject to direct supervision by the federal reserve 

 

sec rulemakings for us registered funds and investment advisers 

blackrock’s business may also be impacted by sec regulatory initiatives the sec and its staff continue to engage in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies in particular in so doing it has introduced rules that include i new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain us registered funds ii enhanced reporting regimes for investments advisers and iii the implementation of fund board approved liquidity risk management programs for etfs and openend funds other than money market funds the new rules will increase blackrock’s public reporting and disclosure requirements which could be costly 

 

the sec has also proposed rules requiring all advisers to implement enhanced business continuity and transition plans as well as more stringent asset segregation rules and leverage limits for us registered funds which may require funds holding derivatives to hold more cash which in turn could cause performance drag and increase tracking error in addition the sec has indicated an intention to propose new rules for the stress testing of registered investment companies and transition planning by asset managers including the transfer of client assets while these proposals have yet to be finalized into new rules any new rules guidance or regulatory initiatives resulting from these efforts could expose blackrock to additional compliance costs and may require the company to change how it operates its business andor manages its funds 

regulation of swaps and derivatives 

the sec the internal revenue service “irs” and the commodity futures trading commission each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures swaps and other derivatives such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts if adopted these limitations could require blackrock to change certain business practices or implement new reporting or compliance processes which could result in additional costs andor restrictions in december 2015 the sec proposed a new rule governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies that if enacted would represent a fundamental change in the nature of the secs regulations governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies this proposal has the potential to require blackrock to change or restrict certain investment strategies or practices for some investment companies and incur additional costs in some circumstances the proposed rule could make certain products less competitive with other investment options in the marketplace which could negatively impact aum 

further the full implementation of regulations under doddfrank and similar regulations in the european union “eu” and other global jurisdictions relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner in which blackrockadvised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives increasing the costs of derivatives trading for blackrock’s clients jurisdictions outside the us or eu in which blackrock operates also have adopted and implemented or are in the process of considering adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could further impact blackrock and the broader markets for example various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require blackrock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject these rules introduce new requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods reporting transactions to central data repositories mandating certain documentation standards requiring the posting and collection of initial andor variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed andor overthecounter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements 

in the united states certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to doddfrank central clearing and electronic trading venue requirements with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future in the eu central clearing requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of blackrock funds and accounts and will continue to be phased in for other types of blackrock funds and accounts over the course of 2017 and beyond on march 1 2017 most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared including nondeliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions will become subject to requirements in the united states eu and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect marktomarket margin payments these rules have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading noncleared derivatives for blackrocks clients the new rules and regulations may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase blackrock’s operational and legal risks

regulation of exchange traded funds 

as a result of market volatility regulators globally are examining the potential risks in etfs including those related to transparency liquidity and structural resiliency blackrock and other large issuers of etfs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to blackrock or at all depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis or any associated structural reforms etf products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions which may require blackrock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the company’s business

taxation 

blackrock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus authorities in particular a number of proposals for broad tax reform of the corporate tax system in the united states are under evaluation by various legislative bodies but it is not possible to determine accurately the overall impact of such proposals at this time similarly the company manages assets that have investment objectives which conform to specific tax law rules which could be impacted by changes in tax law or policy particularly with respect to investment income 

for example blackrock may be impacted by the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” and the common reporting standard “crs” which have introduced new investor onboarding withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring persons with financial assets outside of their tax residence country pay appropriate taxes fatca and crs rules impact both us and nonus funds and subject blackrock to additional administrative burdens and reporting obligations in many instances bilateral intergovernmental agreements between the united states and the countries in which blackrock does business will govern implementation of the new rules while many of these bilateral intergovernmental agreements have been put into place others have yet to be concluded 

the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” has also launched a base erosion and profit shifting “beps” proposal that aims to rationalize tax treatment across jurisdictions in october 2015 the oecd released its final beps package in an effort to curb the use of certain tax regimes and elements of tax planning primarily in a crossborder context the final package was endorsed by the g20 and is subject to implementation as it stands beps contains a number of provisions that would result in increased taxation for crossborder funds particularly affecting fund raising for high alpha alternative products in europe such as private debt and equity in addition in july 2016 the european council formally adopted the antitax avoidance package which contains measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning and to boost tax transparency the beps package and the antitax avoidance package could curtail the amount of investments channeled by and have unintended taxation consequences for funds as well as blackrock’s overall tax position which could adversely affect blackrock’s financial condition and that of its clients

in addition certain eu member states such as france and italy have enacted financial transaction taxes “ftts” which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instruments and derivatives transactions several other member states continue to discuss introducing ftts in general any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would impact investors and would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that blackrock manages in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products an ftt could significantly increase the operational costs of blackrock entering into on behalf of its clients securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to an ftt which could adversely impact blackrock’s financial results and clients’ performance results

lastly the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock these challenges may result in adjustments to or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition 

volcker rule 

provisions of doddfrank referred to as the “volcker rule” created a new section of the bank holding company act of 1956 the “bank holding company act” that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds including hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds collectively “covered funds” the bank holding company act by its terms does not currently apply to blackrock the federal reserve currently takes the position that pnc’s ownership interest in blackrock which is approximately 22 causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for the purpose of the bank holding company act and that blackrock is subject to banking regulation based on this interpretation of the bank holding company act the federal reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that pnc controls blackrock under the terms of the bank holding company act any such determination if successful would subject blackrock to current and future regulatory requirements under the bank holding company act including the volcker rule conformance with the volcker rule may require blackrock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds and to sell certain seed and coinvestments that it holds in those funds which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions 

revised department of labor “dol” fiduciary rule

in april 2016 the dol proposed a new regulation defining the term fiduciary for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of title i of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” and the prohibited transaction exercise tax provisions of the irs the rule is scheduled to begin to apply in april 2017 the rule would require blackrock to revise a number of its distribution relationships create compliance and operational challenges for blackrock’s distribution partners and may limit blackrock’s ability to provide certain useful services and education to its clients on february 3 2017 a presidential memorandum directed the dol to examine the fiduciary rule’s impact and to prepare an updated economic and legal analysis of the rule the “dol memorandum” which could include proposing rules to revise or rescind the fiduciary rule on the same day the dol issued a statement that it would consider its legal options to delay the applicability date of the fiduciary rule as it complies with the dol memorandum

financial crimes enforcement network proposed rulemaking for registered investment advisers 

the financial crime enforcement network has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking “proposed rule” that would extend to a number of blackrock’s subsidiaries which are registered or required to be registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 the “advisers act” the requirement to establish antimoney laundering programs and report suspicious activity to the financial crime enforcement network under the bank secrecy act of 1970 the “bank secrecy act” the proposed rule would extend to those blackrock subsidiaries captured within the bank secrecy act’s definition of “financial institutions” which would require them to comply with the bank secrecy act reporting and recordkeeping requirements if enacted in its current form the proposed rule would expose blackrock to additional compliance costs 

 

us executive order

 

on february 3 2017 a us presidential executive order the “executive order” articulated certain core principles for regulating the us financial system and directed the secretary of the us treasury to report to the president within 120 days on the extent to which existing laws treaties rules regulations and policies promote support or inhibit the federal regulation of the us financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles blackrock will continue to monitor the potential impact of the executive order on its business

british exit from the european union

markets in financial instruments directives 

blackrock is also subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives in europe for example in the eu rules and regulations made under the current markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” regime described more particularly under “— european regulation” below are in the process of being revised through implementation of the “mifid ii” package of measures made up of a recast directive and a new markets in financial instruments regulation mifid ii which is scheduled to come into effect in january 2018 will be implemented through a number of implementing and regulatory technical standards to be made through delegated acts made by the european commission following advice from the european securities and markets authority mifid ii will build upon many of the measures introduced by mifid and will extend investor protection trading transparency clearing and trading venue access and reporting requirements it is expected that mifid ii will have significant and wideranging impacts on eu securities and derivatives markets in particular there will be i enhanced governance and investor protection standards ii prescriptive rules on portfolio management firms’ ability to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes iii enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading iv the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives on to regulated execution venues v the extension of pre and posttrade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments vi restrictions on the use of socalled dark pool trading vii the creation of a new type of trading venue called the organized trading facility for nonequity financial instruments viii new commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements ix a move away from vertical silos in execution clearing and settlement x an enhanced role for the european securities and markets authority in supervising eu securities and derivatives markets and xi new requirements regarding noneu investment firms’ access to eu financial markets implementation of these measures will have direct and indirect impacts on blackrock and its subsidiaries and may require significant changes to client servicing models a significant number of the impacts are yet to be determined because mifid ii contains a wide ranging and complex set of measures the broad nature of the mifid ii reforms may impact blackrock’s distribution client servicing and distribution models in particular affecting the fees blackrock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners market structure reforms may also impact the way that the company executes investment decisions for client portfolios and have an impact on general market liquidity

undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities 

the eu has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” the latest initiative in this area ucits v seeks to align the ucits depositary regime ucits remuneration rules and regulators’ power to sanction for breaches of the ucits directive with the requirements of the alternative investment fund managers directive ucits v came into effect in march 2016 with further implementing measures commencing in october 2016 compliance with the updated ucits directive will subject blackrock to additional expenses associated with new depositary oversight and other organizational requirements 

reform of european retail distribution 

blackrock must also comply with retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections overhauling mutual fund fee structures by banning the payment of commissions to distributors and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector the rules were originally introduced in the uk in 2012 and similar rules have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where blackrock operates such as the netherlands and are under discussion elsewhere similarly mifid ii will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers these rules will lead to greater fragmentation of distribution rules and may lead to changes to blackrock’s client servicing and distribution models in particular affecting the fees blackrock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners 

eu benchmarks regulation 

political agreement on the eu benchmarks regulation was reached at the end of 2015 the regulation provides the legislative framework to implement the 2013 international organization of securities commissions principles for financial benchmarks the scope of the regulation is broad as it includes submissionbased benchmarks through to transactionbased market indices proportionality is applied to create a stricter framework for the systemically relevant benchmarks such as the london interbank offered rate libor and the euro interbank offered rate 

euribor although the regulation creates a number of ob ligations on administrators of and submitters to benchmarks it is less extensive with respect to obligations of users of benchmarks such as asset managers the regulation formalizes due diligence procedures for users and imposes other additional admini strative requirements of users of thirdparty benchmarks managers using thirdparty andor bespoke benchmarks to assess fund performance are also subject to the regulation the regulation comes into effect in january 2018 detailed technical standards are expected to be published this year the regulation will impose additional administrative and due diligence requirements on the company the burden of which is likely to increase as blackrock makes additional enhancements to its indexing business 

 

revised eu capital requirements

revised retail consumer disclosure requirements 

 

eu legislators have introduced a new “key information document” “kid” which is applicable where a retail consumer is sold certain investment products the kid must include specific information on costs risks and performance blackrock will be required to produce a kid for each fund in scope as well as to make information available to distribution partners who sell these funds in the eu

 item 1a r isk factors 

as a global investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks while blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify measure monitor manage and analyze market operating legal compliance fiduciary and investment risks blackrock’s business financial condition operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties including the ones discussed below 

market and competition risks 

changes in the value levels of equity debt real assets commodities foreign exchange or other asset markets may cause assets under management “aum” revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client numerous factors including price movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real assets commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests could cause 











the occurrence of any of these events may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from its investment advisory business the advisory or management contracts blackrock has entered into with its clients including the agreements that govern many of blackrock’s investment funds provide investors or in some cases the independent directors of private investment funds with significant latitude to terminate such contracts withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty or to remove blackrock as a fund’s investment advisor or equivalent blackrock also manages its us mutual funds closedend and exchangetraded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors a majority of whom are independent from the company blackrock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be subject to reduction including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors in addition if a number of blackrock’s clients terminate their contracts remove blackrock from advisory roles liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms the fees or carried interest blackrock earns could be reduced which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

increased competition may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry blackrock competes based on a number of factors including investment performance the level of fees charged the quality and diversity of services and products provided name recognition and reputation and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors in addition the introduction of new technologies as well as regulatory changes have altered the competitive landscape for investment managers which may lead to fee compression or require blackrock to spend more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with products and services offered by other financial institutions technology companies trading advisory or asset management firms increased competition on the basis of any of these factors including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure to maintain aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics c ould lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the sophisticated risk analytics that blackrock provides via the aladdin technology platform to support investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients are an important element of blackrock’s competitive success aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine sophisticated risk analytics with comprehensive portfolio management trading and operations tools on a single platform increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions whether due to price competition or marketbased or regulatory factors may weaken aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the company’s revenue and earnings to decline in addition there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in aladdin

the failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline

in addition a percentage of the deferred compensation that blackrock pays to its employees is tied to the company’s share price as such if blackrock’s share price were to decrease materially the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession if blackrock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession the company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted

in addition when clients retain blackrock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that blackrock must observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose blackrock to lawsuits harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts 

as blackrock’s business continues to grow the company must routinely address conflicts of interest as well as the perception of conflicts of interest between itself and its clients employees or vendors in addition the sec and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts blackrock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues however appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the company fails or appears to fail to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest it may face reputational damage litigation regulatory proceedings or penalties fines andor sanctions any of which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

as described in “item 1businessregulation” pnc owns approximately 22 of blackrock’s capital stock  which may subject blackrock to banking regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc the bank holding company act by its terms does not currently apply to blackrock the federal reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for the purpose of the bank holding company act and that blackrock is subject to banking regulation based on this interpretation of the bank holding company act the federal reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that pnc controls blackrock under the terms of the bank holding company act any such determination if successful would subject blackrock to current and future regulatory requirements under the bank holding company act including the volcker rule that are more restrictive than those the company is subject to under other applicable laws as well as the enforcement authority of the federal reserve which includes the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations any effort by blackrock to contest a control determination by the federal reserve may be costly and complex and may not result in a reversal of such determination in addition blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary which is organized as a national bank is separately subject to banking regulation by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” the occ has broad supervisory and 

enforcement authority over blackrock’s trust bank and also subjects it to capital requirements being subject to banking regulation may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations 

failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline

nongaap financial measures 

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with gaap however management believes evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators for both management and investors of blackrock’s financial performance over time management also uses nongaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented nongaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock’s revenue and expense blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 

management uses both gaap and nongaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance adjustments to gaap financial measures “nongaap adjustments” include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow 

computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows 

1 operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted 

management believes operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time and therefore provide useful disclosure to investors 

 



 





revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the company’s products in addition management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services which due to the terms of the contracts are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time substantially offset distribution fee revenue the company earns for each of these items blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue 

2 nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted 

nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted equals nonoperating income expense gaap basis less net income loss attributable to nci adjusted for compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans the compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income this compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans which are reported in nonoperating income expense gaap basis 

management believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides comparability of information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock’s nonoperating contribution to results 

 



 

3 n et income attributable to blackrock as adjusted 

 



 

management believes net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted and diluted earnings per common share as adjusted are useful measures of blackrock’s profitability and financial performance net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted equals net income attributable to blackrock inc gaap basis adjusted for significant nonrecurring items charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow

see aforementioned discussion regarding operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted for information on the pnc ltip funding obligation and the restructuring charge 

for each period presented the nongaap adjustment related to the restructuring charge and pnc ltip funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash benefits expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented   

per share amounts reflect net income attributable to blackrock as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding

discussion of financial results 

introduction 

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets additional fundings 

from existing clients including dividend reinvestment withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investmen ts to investors market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on and changes in the fair value of securities held in client accounts foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating nonus dollar denominated aum in to us dollars for reporting purposes 

blackrock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and brokerdealers the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities generally the revenue earned is shared between blackrock and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed historically securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds revenue in the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand 

investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative andor absolute investment performance in addition to base fees based on aum investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold as such the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of blackrock’s revenue and earnings the magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products however the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either september 30 or december 31 

blackrock provides a variety of risk management investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions pension funds asset managers foundations consultants mutual fund sponsors real estate investment trusts government agencies and retail intermediaries these services are provided under the brand name blackrock solutions and include a wide array of risk management services valuation services related to illiquid securities disposition and workout assignments including longterm portfolio liquidation assignments strategic planning and execution enterprise investment system outsourcing and wealth management technology services to clients the company’s aladdin operating platform serves as the investmentrisk solutions system for blackrock and other institutional investors fees earned for blackrock solutions and advisory services are determined using some or all of the following methods i percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform ii fixedrate fees and iii fees billed on a time and materials basis

approximately 75 of the company’s revenue is generated in us dollars the company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies primarily the euro and british pound are impacted by foreign exchange rates any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the company’s considerable nondollar expense base related to its operations outside the united states 

nonoperating income expense includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments excluding availableforsale investments and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to availableforsale investments blackrock primarily holds seed and coinvestments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including private equity hedge funds and real assets investments generally are made for coinvestment purposes to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes including federal reserve bank stock blackrock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients

contingent payments related to business acquisitions  in connection with certain acquisitions blackrock is required to make contingent payments subject to achieving specified performance targets which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products the fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at december 31 2016 totaled 115 million and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition

subject to such clawback provisions in total investments or cashcash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed and as a deferred carried interest liabilityother liabil ities of consolidated vies on its consolidated sta tements of financial condition carried interest is recorded as performance fees on blackrock’s consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically imp robable 

indemnifications in the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements blackrock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances the terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability if any cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and therefore has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31 2016 see further discussion in note 13 commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing 

on behalf of certain clients the company lends securities to highly rated banks and brokerdealers in these securities lending transactions the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral blackrock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligation under the securities lending agreement at december 31 2016 the company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately 1693 billion the company held as agent cash and securities totaling 1801 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31 2016 the fair value of these indemnifications was not material at december 31 2016 

while the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement in the event of a borrower default the company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations if the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the company has provided indemnification blackrock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall these indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above and do not in any way guarantee assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing 

consolidation

in the normal course of business the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles the company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a vie or a vre assessing whether an entity is a vie or a vre involves judgment and analysis factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company’s involvement with the entity investments that are determined to be vres are consolidated if the company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which generally exists if there is greater than 50 voting interest see note 4 consolidated voting rights entities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information investments that are determined to be vies are consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary “pb” of the entity

at december 31 2016 blackrock was determined to be the pb for certain investment funds that were determined to be vies which required blackrock to consolidate them blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie the company generally consolidates vies in which it holds an equity ownership interest of 10 or greater and deconsolidates such vies once equity ownership falls below 10 see note 5 variable interest entities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information 

investments 

equity method investments  for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where it is not the pb of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company follows the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity 

blackrock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value therefore under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently availab le information and is recorded as nonoperating income expense for investments in investment companies or as other revenue for certain strategic investments which are recorded in other assets since such investees are considered to be an extension of bl ackrock’s core business 

at december 31 2016 the company had 730 million and 348 million of equity method investments including equity method investments held for deferred compensation reflected within investments and other assets respectively and at december 31 2015 the company had 527 million and 265 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets respectively 

impairments of investments management periodically assesses equity method availableforsale heldtomaturity and cost investments for otherthantemporary impairment “otti” if an otti exists an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income expense on the consolidated statements of the income 

for equity method heldtomaturity and cost method investments if circumstances indicate that an otti may exist the investments are evaluated using market values where available or the expected future cash flows of the investment if the company determines an otti exists an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value 

for availableforsale securities when the fair value is lower than cost the company considers among other factors the length of time the security has been in a loss position the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses for equity securities if the impairment is considered otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value for debt securities the company considers whether 1 it has the intent to sell the security 2 it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or 3 it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security if the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value must be recognized in earnings if the company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered an impairment related to credit the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total decline in value and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

 

for the company’s investments in clos the company reviews cash flow estimates over the life of each clo investment on a quarterly basis if the present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows an impairment is considered to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value

evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 

fair value measurements 

the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements 

changes in valuation changes in value on 2255 million of total investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense 80 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income 142 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 126 million relates to carried interest which will not impact nonoperating income expense at december 31 2016 changes in fair value of approximately 1365 million of such consolidated viesvres will impact blackrock’s net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was 1176 million 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary openend investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost in addition trade namestrademarks are considered indefinitelived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with current accounting guidance indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2016 ranged from 1 to 9 years with a weightedaverage remaining estimated useful life of 38 years 

goodwill the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment assessment performed as of july 31 2016 indicated no impairment charge was required the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2016 the company’s common stock closed at 38054 which exceeded its book value of approximately 17838 per share 

 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinitelife and finitelife classifications are still appropriate 

 

in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is less than carrying value blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates in addition the company considered other factors including i macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions limitations on acce ssing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or other developments in equity and credit markets ii industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates an increased competitive environment a decline in marketdependent multiples or metrics a change in the market for an entity’s services or regulatory legal or political developments and iii entityspecific events such as a change in management or key personnel overall financial perfo rmance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset if an indefinitelived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired then the fair value of the asset is c ompared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 

for finitelived intangible assets if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform a recoverability test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 99 million 128 million and 157 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

in 2016 2015 and 2014 the company performed impairment tests including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments the company determined that no impairment charges were required the classification of indefinitelived versus finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles were required the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

income taxes

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2016 blackrock had 410 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 284 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2016 the company had deferred tax assets of 20 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately 4840 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company 

the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard the assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately 247 million and current income taxes payables of 75 million at december 31 2016 

revenue recognition

investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or in the case of certain real asset clients net operating income generated by the underlying properties investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers 

the company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the company manages such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund in certain cases the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the company bears no credit risk to the thirdparty the company records its management fees net of retrocessions retrocessions for 2016 2015 and 2014 were 804 million 870 million and 891 million respectively the company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which due to the terms of the contracts are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income 

the company earns revenue by lendin g securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and brokerdealers revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis the securities loaned are secured by collateral generally rangi ng from 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities generally the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed for 201 6  201 5 and 201 4  securities lending revenue earned by the company totaled  579 million  513 million and 4 7 7 million respectively and is recorded in investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as th e fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee 

the company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which varies by product or account and could be monthly quarterly annually or longer 

in addition the company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds blackrock may be required to reversereturn all or part of such carried interest allocations depending upon future performance of these funds therefore blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in total investments or cashcash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable 

the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2016 and 2015 the company had 152 million and 143 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilitiesother liabilities of consolidated vies on the consolidated statements of financial condition a portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue if any for these products is unknown 

the following table presents changes in the deferred carried interest liability including the portion related to consolidated vies for 2016 and 2015 

 



 

for 2016 2015 and 2014 performance fee revenue totaled 295 million 621 million and 550 million respectively 

fees earned for blackrock solutions  which include advisory services are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some or all of the following methods i percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform ii fixedrate fees and iii fees billed on a time and materials basis revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of onetime advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on aum of the respective portfolio assignment for 2016 2015 and 2014 blackrock solutions and advisory revenue totaled 714 million 646 million and 635 million respectively 

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable

assets under management 

the company’s aum by product type for the years 2011 through 2015 is presented below 

 



 



component changes in aum by product type for the five years ended december 31 2015 are presented below 

 



 







 

aum represents the broad range of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing for example net asset value reported aum does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice or assets that we are retained to manage on a shortterm temporary basis 

investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of aum we also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreedupon benchmark or return hurdle on some products we also may earn securities lending revenue in addition blackrock offers its proprietary aladdin investment system as well as risk management outsourcing and advisory services to institutional investors under the brs name revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions number of users accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives 

at december 31 2015 total aum was 4645 trillion representing a cagr of 5 over the last five years aum growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains net inflows and acquisitions including claymore and srpep which collectively added 137 billion of aum in 2012 credit suisse and mgpa which collectively added 269 billion of aum in 2013 and bkca infraestructura institucional and futureadvisor which collectively added 22 billion of aum in 2015 our aum mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range as described below 

the company considers the categorization of its aum by client type product type investment style and client region useful to understanding its business the following discussion of the company’s aum will be organized as follows 

 



 

client type 

our organizational structure was designed to ensure that strong investment performance is our highest priority and that we best align with our clients’ needs to capitalize on broader industry trends furthermore our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent   specifically our investments functions are split into distinct strategies active equity and fixed income beta multiasset alternatives and tradingliquidity   

we serve a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe clients include taxexempt institutions such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans charities foundations and endowments official institutions such as central banks sovereign wealth funds supranationals and other government entities taxable institutions including insurance companies financial institutions corporations and thirdparty fund sponsors and retail investors ishares is presented as a separate client type below with investments in ishares by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections below 

aum by investment style and client type at december 31 2015 is presented below 

 



 

retail 

blackrock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the active and passive spectrum including separate accounts openend and closedend funds unit trusts and private investment funds retail investors are served principally through intermediaries including brokerdealers banks trust companies insurance companies and independent financial advisors clients invest primarily in mutual funds which totaled 4464 billion or 83 of retail longterm aum at yearend with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts “smas” the majority 92 of longterm retail aum is invested in active products although this is impacted by ishares being shown separately retail represented 13 of longterm aum at december 31 2015 and 35 of longterm base fees for 2015 

component changes in retail longterm aum for 2015 are presented below 

 



 



the retail client base is diversified geographically with 70 of longterm aum managed for investors based in the americas 24 in emea and 6 in asiapacific at yearend 2015 





ishares 

ishares is the leading etf provider in the world with 11 trillion of aum at december 31 2015 and was the top asset gatherer globally in 2015 1 with 1299 billion of net inflows for an organic growth rate of 13 equity net inflows of 784 billion were driven by flows into the core series and into funds with broad developed market equity exposures partially offset by outflows from emerging market products record fixed income net inflows of 503 billion were diversified across exposures and product lines led by flows into core corporate and high yield bond funds ishares multiasset class and alternatives funds contributed a combined 12 billion of net inflows primarily into core allocation funds ishares represented 25 of longterm aum at december 31 2015 and 35 of longterm base fees for 2015 

component changes in ishares aum for 2015 are presented below 

 



 



our broad ishares product range offers investors a precise transparent and efficient way to tap market returns and gain access to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult for many investors to access as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and costefficiently 





institutional 

blackrock’s institutional aum is well diversified by both product and region and we serve institutional investors on six continents in subcategories including pensions endowments and foundations official institutions and financial institutions 





component changes in institutional longterm aum for 2015 are presented below 

 



 



institutional active aum ended 2015 at 9629 billion reflecting 268 billion of net inflows institutional active represented 22 of longterm aum and 20 of longterm base fees growth in aum reflected continued strength in multiasset class products with net inflows of 184 billion reflecting ongoing demand for solutions offerings and the lifepath ® targetdate suite our topperforming fixed income platform generated net inflows of 57 billion diversified across exposures alternatives net inflows of 31 billion were led by inflows into infrastructure and alternatives solutions offerings in addition 2015 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives and we raised over 5 billion in new commitments which will be a source of future net inflows equity net outflows of 05 billion reflected fundamental net outflows of 22 billion which were partially offset by scientific net inflows of 17 billion 

institutional index aum totaled 1739 trillion at december 31 2015 reflecting net outflows of 431 billion equity net outflows of 337 billion were primarily due to lowfee global and regional index equity outflows as clients looked to reallocate rebalance or meet their cash needs fixed income net outflows of 102 billion were concentrated in local currency mandates linked to outflows from liability management strategies institutional index represented 40 of longterm aum at december 31 2015 and accounted for 10 of longterm base fees for 2015 

the company’s institutional clients consist of the following 







product type 

component changes in aum by product type and investment style for 2015 are presented below 

 



 



longterm product offerings include active and index strategies our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile we offer two types of active strategies those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction in contrast index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index index strategies include both our nonetf index products and ishares etfs 

although many clients use both active and index strategies the application of these strategies may differ for example clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class in addition institutional nonetf index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and typically reflect low fee rates this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

equity 

yearend 2015 equity aum totaled 2424 trillion reflecting net inflows of 528 billion net inflows included 784 billion and 42 billion into ishares and active products respectively ishares net inflows were driven by the core series and flows into broad developed market equity exposures and active net inflows reflected demand for international equities ishares and active net inflows were partially offset by nonetf index net outflows of 298 billion 

blackrock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix approximately half of blackrock’s equity aum is tied to international markets including emerging markets which tend to have higher fee rates than us equity strategies accordingly fluctuations in international equity markets which do not consistently move in tandem with us markets may have a greater impact on blackrock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues 

fixed income 

fixed income aum ended 2015 at 1422 trillion increasing 287 billion or 2 from december 31 2014 the increase in aum reflected 769 billion in net inflows partially offset by 482 billion in net market depreciation and foreign exchange movements in 2015 active net inflows of 359 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings with strong flows into our unconstrained total return and high yield strategies flagship funds in these product areas include our unconstrained strategic income opportunities and fixed income strategies funds with net inflows of 70 billion and 37 billion respectively our total return fund with net inflows of 27 billion and our high yield bond fund with net inflows of 35 billion fixed income ishares net inflows of 503 billion were led by flows into core corporate and high yield bond funds active and ishares net inflows were partially offset by nonetf index net outflows of 93 billion 

multiasset class 

blackrock’s multiasset class team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities bonds currencies and commodities and our extensive risk management capabilities investment solutions might include a combination of longonly portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays 

component changes in multiasset class aum for 2015 are presented below 

 



 



multiasset class net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutionsbased advice with 174 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows and contributed 73 billion to institutional multiasset class net new business in 2015 primarily into target date and target risk product offerings retail net outflows of 13 billion were primarily due to a large singleclient transition out of mutual funds into a series of ishares across asset classes notwithstanding this transition retail flows reflected demand for our multiasset income fund family which raised 46 billion in 2015

the company’s multiasset class strategies include the following 









alternatives 

blackrock alternative investors “bai” focuses on sourcing and managing highalpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing our alternatives products fall into two main categories — 1 core and 2 currency and commodities core includes alternative solutions direct hedge funds hedge fund and private equity solutions funds of funds opportunistic private equity and credit real estate and infrastructure offerings the products offered under the bai umbrella are described below 

in 2015 blackrock returned 33 billion of capital to investors which is included in outflows in addition we raised 57 billion of new commitments in 2015 across a variety of strategies including private equity solutions opportunistic credit alternative solutions real estate and infrastructure at yearend we had 109 billion of nonfee paying unfunded commitments which are expected to be deployed in future years these commitments are not included in aum until they are invested 

we believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings as a top ten alternative provider 3 our highly diversified 1128 billion alternatives franchise is well positioned to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors 

 



 

component changes in alternatives aum for 2015 are presented in the table below

securities lending 

securities lending is managed by a dedicated team supported by quantitative analysis proprietary technology and disciplined risk management blackrock receives both cash primarily for us domiciled portfolios and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements the cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios fees for securities lending for us domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both the value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed the value of the collateral is not included in aum 

outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately 218 billion up from 187 billion at yearend 2014 liability spreads were generally flat compared to 2014 levels 

blackrock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality liquidity and interest rate risk management disciplined risk management including a rigorous credit surveillance process is an integral part of the investment process blackrock’s cash management credit committee has established risk limits such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits across many of the products blackrock manages including over all of its cash management products in the ordinary course of our business there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed no such instances individually or in the aggregate have been material to the company to the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded the relevant portfolio will be adjusted to the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers while a risk limit may be waived temporarily such waivers are infrequent 

risk  quantitative analysis 

across all asset classes in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams the risk  quantitative analysis “rqa” group at blackrock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and thirdparty data to identify measure and manage a wide range of risks rqa provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk managementrelated analytical and information requirements where appropriate rqa will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics

regulation 

virtually all aspects of blackrock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world some of which are summarized below these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients investors in registered and unregistered investment companies trust customers of blackrock institutional trust company na “btc” pnc and its bank subsidiaries and their customers and the financial system under these laws and regulations agencies that regulate investment advisers investment funds and bank holding companies and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers including the power to limit restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time revocation of investment adviser and other registrations censures and fines both for individuals and blackrock 

the rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical accordingly the discussion below is general in nature does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report 

global regulatory reform 

blackrock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives around the world any such initiative or any new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities lead to business disruptions require blackrock to alter its business or operating activities and expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and legal costs as well as reputational harm blackrock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing banking taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce 

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “dfa” was signed into law in the us the dfa is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions many of which have been adopted blackrock has commenced a conformance program to address certain regulations adopted under the dfa as well as financial reforms that have been introduced as part of the sec’s investment company modernization initiatives the cost of these initial conformance activities have been absorbed by blackrock however as the full extent of the dfa and other rules will only become evident over time it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that the dfa or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions will have upon blackrock’s business financial condition and operating activities 

systemically important financial institution review 

both the financial stability board “fsb” working with the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” and the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” are considering potential systemic risk related to asset management in july 2014 the fsoc issued a statement indicating that their review would focus on products and activities and fsoc subsequently released a request for information addressing market liquidity and fund redemption risk the use of leverage operational risk and the resolution of asset managers including the transition of client assets in june 2015 iosco issued a statement indicating they also favored a products and activities approach in their review of asset managers and in july 2015 the fsb made a similar announcement in september 2015 the fsb released a statement indicating that their review would focus on market liquidity and fund redemption risk the use of leverage securities lending practices operational risk and risks from pension funds and sovereign wealth funds

although fsoc iosco and fsb have shifted from a focus on designating firms andor funds as systemically important ie gsifi or sifi designations the process is ongoing and may lead to designations in the future in the event that blackrock receives a sifi designation under the dfa the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” is charged with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions and blackrock could become subject to direct supervision by the federal reserve if blackrock was designated a sifi or gsifi it could become subject to enhanced prudential capital supervisory and other requirements such as riskbased capital requirements leverage limits liquidity requirements resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements concentration limits a contingent capital requirement enhanced public disclosures shortterm debt limits and overall risk management requirements requirements such as these which were designed to regulate banking institutions would be extremely burdensome for blackrock unless they were modified to be applicable to an asset manager no proposals have been made indicating how such measures would be adapted for asset managers if at all 

securities and exchange commission review of asset managers 

blackrock’s business may also be impacted by securities and exchange commission “sec” regulatory initiatives the sec and its staff continue to engage in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies in particular during 2015 the sec proposed among other things enhanced reporting by investment advisors enhanced reporting on registered mutual funds new rules for liquidity risk management in registered funds and new rules governing the use of derivatives and leverage by registered investment companies and business development companies furthermore in june 2015 the sec issued a request for comments regarding practices related to exchangetraded funds “etfs” which is 

widely expected to result in a future rulemaking the sec has also indicated an intention to propose new rules for the stress testing of registered investment companies and transition planning by asset managers including the transfer of client assets the sec’s focus has also been directed toward risk identification and controls in various areas including the use of derivatives and other trading practices as reflected in the sec’s late december 2015 rule proposal described more particularly under” – regulation of swaps and derivatives below   cybersecurity and the evaluation of systemic risks while these proposals have yet to be finali zed into new rules a ny new rules guidance or regulatory initiatives resulting from these efforts could expose blackrock to additional compliance and reporting costs and may require the company to change how it operates its business or manages funds  

money market fund reform 

in july 2014 the sec adopted new rules designed to reform the regulatory structure governing money market funds “mmfs” and to address the perceived systemic risks that such funds present the new rules to which us mmfs must conform by october 2016 require institutional prime and institutional municipal mmfs to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the marketbased value of fund assets retail mmfs may continue operating with a constant net asset value per share the rules also provide for new tools for institutional and retail mmfs’ boards designed to address market shocks including liquidity fees and redemption gates the new rules do not apply to government nonmunicipal mmfs although such funds may “optin” to the new liquidity fee and redemption gate provisions if previously disclosed to investors implementation of these new rules requires the development of new or additional systems by blackrock and the funds’ service providers blackrock has commenced efforts to move its mmfs into compliance in advance of the deadline the impact of the rules that affect the structure of the funds on blackrock’s business remains uncertain as clients must decide which products fit their investment needs the new rules will however affect certain of blackrock’s funds’ investment strategies portfolio liquidity and return potential the new rules will also result in changes to blackrock’s existing us mmfs and may reduce the attractiveness of certain us mmfs to investors

regulation of swaps and derivatives 

the sec the internal revenue service “irs” and the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures swaps and other derivatives such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts if adopted these limitations could require blackrock to change certain business practices or implement new reporting or compliance processes which could result in additional costs andor restrictions in december 2015 the sec proposed a new rule governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies that if enacted would represent a fundamental change in the nature of the secs regulations governing the use of derivatives and other financial commitment transactions by investment companies this proposal has the potential to require blackrock to change or restrict certain investment strategies or practices for some investment companies and incur additional costs in some circumstances the proposed rule could make certain products less competitive with other investment options in the marketplace which could negatively impact assets under management 

further the full implementation of regulations under the dfa and similar regulations in the european union “eu” and other global jurisdictions relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner in which blackrockadvised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives increasing the costs of derivatives trading for blackrock’s clients for example various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require blackrock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject these rules also introduce new requirements for centrally clearing certain swaps transactions and for executing certain swaps transactions on or through cftc or secregistered trading venues as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods 

jurisdictions outside the us in which blackrock operates also have adopted and implemented or are in the process of considering adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could further impact blackrock and the broader markets this includes the implementation of mandated central clearing of swaps in the eu and the implementation of trade reporting documentation central clearing and other requirements in various jurisdictions globally 

in the united states certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are already subject to the dfa central clearing and electronic trading venue requirements with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in 2016 and beyond for swaps and securitybased swaps that are not centrally cleared us bank regulators recently adopted rules that could require blackrockadvised funds and accounts to post margin payments when trading with a swap dealer that is regulated by one of the us bank regulators the cftc also recently adopted similar margin rules applicable when trading noncleared swaps with swap dealers who are not regulated by one of the us bank regulators these rules have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading noncleared derivatives for blackrocks clients in emea central clearing requirements will be implemented in a phased manner and will apply to blackrock funds and accounts beginning in the latter half of 2016 the new rules and regulations may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase blackrock’s operational and legal risks

regulation of exchange traded funds 

as a result of recent market volatility regulators globally are examining the potential risks in etfs including those related to transparency liquidity and structural resiliency blackrock and other large issuers of etfs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to blackrock or at all depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis or any associated structural reforms etf products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions which may require blackrock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the company’s business

taxation 

blackrock’s businesses may be affected by new tax legislation or regulations or the modification of existing tax laws regulations and rulings by us or nonus authorities in particular blackrock may be impacted by the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” and the common reporting standard “crs” which have introduced new investor onboarding withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring persons with financial assets outside of the their tax residence country pay appropriate taxes fatca and crs rules will impact both us and 

nonus funds and subject blackrock to additional administrative burdens in many instances bilateral intergovernmental agreements “igas” between the us and the countries in which blackrock does business will g overn implementation of the new rules while many of these igas have been put into place others have yet to be concluded 

the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” has also launched a base erosion and profit shifting “beps” proposal that aims to rationalize tax treatment across jurisdictions in october 2015 the oecd released its final beps package in an effort to curb the use of certain tax regimes and elements of tax planning primarily in a crossborder context the final package was endorsed by the g20 and is subject to implementation in addition in january 2016 the european commission announced an antitax avoidance package “eu package” for consideration by the european parliament and council containing measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning and to boost tax transparency once implemented the beps package and the eu package could curtail the amount of investments channeled by and have unintended taxation consequences for funds as well as blackrock’s overall tax position which could adversely affect blackrock’s financial condition and that of its clients

in addition certain eu member states such as france and italy have enacted financial transaction taxes “ftts” which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instruments and derivatives transactions several other member states continue to discuss introducing ftts in general any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would impact investors and would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that blackrock manages in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products an ftt could significantly increase the operational costs of blackrock entering into on behalf of its clients securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to an ftt which could adversely impact blackrock’s financial results and clients’ performance results

lastly the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge blackrock’s historical tax positions these challenges may result in adjustments to blackrock’s tax position or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition 

volcker rule 

provisions of the dfa referred to as the “volcker rule” place limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds including hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds collectively “covered funds” because the federal reserve currently treats blackrock as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc blackrock may be required to conform its activities to the requirements of the volcker rule on december 18 2014 the federal reserve announced a second extension to the volcker rule conformance period giving banking entities until july 21 2016 to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to december 31 2013 “legacy covered funds” the federal reserve also announced its intention to grant banking entities an additional oneyear extension of the conformance period until july 21 2017 to conform ownership interests in and relationships with these legacy covered funds the volcker rule’s restrictions may among other things limit blackrock’s ability to invest in covered funds and require blackrock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds which could subject blackrock to additional expense the volcker rule may also require blackrock to sell certain seed and coinvestments that it holds in covered funds which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions the volcker rule may also reduce the level of market making and liquidity activities of several of blackrock’s trading counterparties which may adversely impact the liquidity and in some cases the pricing of various financial instruments in which blackrock client accounts invest for a further discussion of the volcker rule see “item 1a — risk factors — legal and regulatory risks” 

revised department of labor “dol” fiduciary rule

in april 2015 the dol proposed a new regulation defining the term fiduciary for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of title i of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” and the prohibited transaction exercise tax provisions of the irs the rule has been highly criticized by industry participants particularly retail intermediaries and blackrock is engaging with the dol trade associations and industry participants in an effort to affect revisions to the proposed rule to the extent the rule is enacted as written it will require blackrock to repaper a number of its distribution relationships create compliance and operational challenges for blackrock’s distribution partners and may limit blackrock’s ability to provide certain useful services and education to its clients 

markets in financial instruments directives 

blackrock is also subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives in europe for example in the eu rules and regulations made under the current markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” regime described more particularly under “— european regulation” below are in the process of being revised through implementation of the “mifid ii” package of measures made up of a recast directive and a new markets in financial instruments regulation mifid ii which was originally scheduled to come into effect in january 2017 but is now scheduled to come into effect in january 2018 will be implemented through a number of implementing and regulatory technical standards to be made through delegated acts made by the european commission following advice from the european securities and markets authority “esma” mifid ii will build upon many of the measures introduced by mifid and will extend investor protection trading transparency clearing and trading venue access and reporting requirements it is expected that mifid ii will have significant and wideranging impacts on eu securities and derivatives markets in particular there will be i enhanced governance and investor protection standards ii prescriptive rules on portfolio management firms’ ability to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes iii enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading iv the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives on to regulated execution venues v the extension of pre and posttrade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments vi restrictions on the use of socalled dark pool trading vii the creation of a new type of trading venue called the organized trading facility for nonequity financial instruments viii commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements ix a move away from vertical silos in execution clearing and settlement x an enhanced role for esma in supervising eu securities and derivatives markets and xi new requirements regarding noneu investment firms’ access to eu financial markets implementation of these measures will have direct and indirect impacts on blackrock and its subsidiaries and may require significant changes to client servicing models a significant number of the impacts are yet to be determined because mifid ii contains a wide ranging and complex set of measures 

undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities 

the eu has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” the latest initiative in this area ucits v seeks to align the ucits depositary regime ucits remuneration rules and regulators’ power to sanction for breaches of the ucits directive with the requirements of the alternative investment fund managers directive “aifmd” ucits v is required to be adopted in the national law of each eu member state by march 18 2016 though further implementing measures will only become effective in late 2016 compliance with the updated ucits directive will subject blackrock to additional expenses associated with new depositary oversight and other organizational requirements 

reform of european retail distribution 

blackrock must also comply with retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections overhauling mutual fund fee structures by banning the payment of commissions to distributors and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector the rules were originally introduced in the united kingdom in 2012 and similar rules have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where blackrock operates such as the netherlands and are under discussion elsewhere similarly mifid ii will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers these rules will lead to greater fragmentation of distribution rules and may lead to changes to blackrock’s client servicing and distribution models in particular affecting the fees blackrock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners 

eu benchmarks regulation 

political agreement on the eu benchmarks regulation was reached at the end of 2015 the regulation provides the legislative framework to implement the 2013 iosco principles for financial benchmarks the scope of the regulation is broad as it includes submission based benchmarks through to transaction based market indices proportionality is applied to create a stricter framework for the systemically relevant benchmarks such as libor and euribor although the regulation creates a number of obligations on administrators of and submitters to benchmarks it is less extensive as regards the obligations of users of benchmarks such as asset managers the regulation formalizes due diligence procedures for users and implies other additional administrative requirements of users of thirdparty benchmarks managers using thirdparty andor bespoke benchmarks to assess fund performance are also caught by the regulation it is expected that detailed rulemaking underpinning the regulations framework will be developed during 2016 and implemented beginning in 2018 while it is not yet possible to assess the full effect of the regulation on blackrocks business it may impose additional administrative and due diligence requirements on the company the burden of which is likely to increase as blackrock makes additional enhancements to its indexing business

financial crimes enforcement network “fincen” proposed rulemaking for registered investment advisers

fincen has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking “proposed rule” that would extend to a number of blackrock’s subsidiaries which are registered or required to be registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 the “advisers act” the requirement to establish antimoney laundering programs and report suspicious activity to fincen under the bank secrecy act of 1970 the “bank secrecy act” the proposed rule would extend to those blackrock subsidiaries captured within the bank secrecy act’s definition of “financial institutions” which would require them to comply with the bank secrecy act reporting and recordkeeping requirements if enacted in its current form the proposed rule would expose blackrock to additional compliance costs 

financial conduct authority “fca” asset management market survey

as part of its strategic priorities the fca is undertaking a market study into the asset management sector the aim of this study is to understand whether competition is working effectively to enable both institutional and retail investors to get value for money when purchasing asset management services the fca is interested in understanding whether there are any barriers to innovation or technological advances which may be preventing new ways of doing business that could benefit investors fintech if the fca concludes that competition is not working well the fca may intervene through rulemaking introducing firmspecific remedies or enforcement action publishing general guidance or proposing enhanced industry selfregulation blackrock is one of 40 firms included in the study and is currently responding to an information request that consists of qualitative and quantitative data the fca is aiming to engage with firms throughout 2016 with the proposal to issue a draft report to the industry in the summer of 2016 the fca expect to publish their final report in early 2017

us banking regulation 

pnc is a bank holding company and regulated as a “financial holding company” by the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of 1956 the “bhc act” as described in “item 1business” as of december 31 2015 pnc owned approximately 22 of blackrock’s capital stock based on the federal reserve’s interpretation of the bhc act the federal reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for purposes of the bhc act thereby subjecting blackrock to banking regulation including the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve and to most banking laws regulations and orders that apply to pnc including the volcker rule the supervision and regulation of pnc and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws are intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries its depositors the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation and the financial system as a whole rather than for the protection of stockholders creditors or clients of pnc or blackrock 

blackrock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company under the bhc act investment management is an authorized activity but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements which in some cases are more restrictive than those blackrock faces under applicable securities laws blackrock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory administrative or other services only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations based on the federal reserve’s position that blackrock is a nonbank subsidiary of pnc the federal reserve has broad powers to approve deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for blackrock to conduct new activities acquire or divest businesses or assets or reconfigure existing operations and there are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of pnc to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with blackrock or its funds pnc and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of blackrock’s businesses furthermore the federal reserve has broad enforcement authority over nonbank subsidiaries including the power to prohibit them from conducting any activity that in the federal reserve’s opinion is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice the federal reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws regulations and orders the dfa strengthened the federal reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s nonbank subsidiaries 

any failure of pnc to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain blackrock activities and its growth such a change of status could be caused by any failure of pnc or one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” by any examination downgrade of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries or by any failure of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 

one of blackrock’s subsidiaries btc is organized as a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans btc is a member of the federal reserve system accordingly btc is examined and supervised by the occ and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the occ such as capital adequacy regulations governing fiduciaries conflicts of interest selfdealing and antimoney laundering laws and regulations btc is also subject to various federal reserve regulations applicable to member institutions such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of btc’s customers and not btc blackrock and its affiliates or blackrock’s stockholders 

regulation of securities lending financing transactions

in its 2014 annual report the fsoc identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers who act as lending agents as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring the federal reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions “sfts” in addition in october 2015 the european parliament adopted the european commission’s proposal for a european regulation on the reporting and transparency of sfts the sft regulation aims to improve the transparency surrounding sfts and limit the perceived risks of sfts by among other things requiring central reporting of sfts requiring disclosure of sfts to investors and imposing minimum requirements relating to the difference in prices at which a market maker can buy and sell a security in sfts if the recent scrutiny of sfts results in additional regulatory requirements or reporting obligations blackrock may be 

required to introduce additional compliance measures which will subject blackrock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in blackrock’s sft activities including po tential adjustments to its activities as agent lender for its clients  

existing international regulation — overview

the occurrence of any of these events may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from its investment advisory business the advisory or management contracts blackrock has entered into with its clients including the agreements that govern many of blackrock’s investment funds provide investors or in some cases the independent directors of private investment funds with significant latitude to terminate such contracts withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty or to remove blackrock as a fund’s investment advisor or equivalent blackrock also manages its us mutual funds closedend and exchangetraded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors a majority of whom are independent from the company blackrock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be subject to reduction including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors in addition if a number of blackrock’s clients terminate their contracts remove blackrock from advisory roles liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms the fees or carried interest blackrock earns could be reduced which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

increased competition may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry blackrock competes based on a number of factors including investment performance the level of fees charged the quality and diversity of services and products provided name recognition and reputation and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors increased competition on the basis of any of these factors including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure to maintain aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the sophisticated risk analytics that blackrock provides via the aladdin technology platform to support investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients are an important element of blackrock’s competitive success aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine sophisticated risk analytics with comprehensive portfolio management trading and operations tools on a single platform increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions whether due to marketbased or regulatory factors may weaken aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the company’s revenue and earnings to decline in addition there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in aladdin 

the impairment or failure of other financial institutions may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages to many different industries and counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial and investment banks clearing organizations mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients transactions with counterparties expose the products and accounts blackrock manages to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults although blackrock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may otherwise fail to meet their obligations any such impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts managed by blackrock which could lead to the loss of clients and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by blackrock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar blackrock products irrespective of the performance of such products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

changes in the value of seed and coinvestments that blackrock owns could affect its nonoperating income and could increase the volatility of its earnings 

at december 31 2015 blackrock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately 15 billion in its investments see “item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsinvestments” primarily resulted from coinvestments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real estate commodities or alternative investments could lower the value of these investments increase the volatility of blackrock’s earnings and may cause earnings to decline 

acts of terror and the continued threat of terrorism as well as increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international regional and domestic markets which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism and acts of civil or international hostility both within the united states and abroad as well as ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets loss of life property damage disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity acts of terror may also result in increased border security between countries which could adversely affect trade impede growth and exacerbate refugee crises arising out of civil or international conflicts continued geopolitical unrest and terrorist activity that adversely affect the global economy or capital markets may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline

risks related to investment performance 

poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the company’s management believes that investment performance including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of aum poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline as a result of 













performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings 

a portion of blackrock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments performance fees represented 621 million or 5 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 generally the company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement pursuant to which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded a performance fee for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods which may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure to identify errors in the quantitative models blackrock utilizes to manage its business could adversely impact product performance and client relationships 

blackrock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions and allocations including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on blackrock’s business and reputation 

technology and operational risks 

a failure in blackrock’s operational systems or infrastructure including business continuity plans could disrupt operations damage the company’s reputation and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s infrastructure including its technological capacity data centers and office space is vital to the competitiveness of its business moreover a significant portion of blackrock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas including san francisco new york london and gurgaon the failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of blackrock’s business or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside blackrock’s control including a major earthquake hurricane fire terrorist act pandemic or other catastrophic event in any location at which blackrock maintains a major presence could materially impact operations result in disruption to the business or impede its growth notwithstanding blackrock’s efforts to ensure business continuity if it fails to keep business continuity plans uptodate or if such plans including secure backup facilities and systems and the availability of backup employees are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption the company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline or impact the company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm regulatory fines andor sanctions 

a cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cyber security policies procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a hacker attack virus phishing scam or worm or an internally caused issue such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information 

there have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumerbased companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information as well as cyberattacks involving the dissemination theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties including actions by terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments blackrock has been the target of attempted cyberattacks as well as the coopting of its brand to create fraudulent websites and must continuously monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption as the failure to do so could disrupt blackrock’s operations and cause financial losses in addition due to blackrock’s interconnectivity with thirdparty vendors central agents exchanges clearing houses and other financial institutions blackrock may be adversely affected if any of them are subject to a successful cyberattack or other information security event any information security incident or cyberattack against blackrock or third parties with whom it is connected could result in material financial loss loss of competitive position regulatory fines andor sanctions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure or unavailability of thirdparty dependencies may adversely affect aladdin operations and could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

blackrock relies on its ability to maintain a robust and secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the aladdin platform the analytical capabilities of aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into aladdin analytical calculations the failure of these third parties to provide such data or information or disruption of such information flows could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients 

operating risks associated with blackrock’s securities lending program may result in client losses 

blackrock lends securities to banks and brokerdealers on behalf of certain of its clients in these securities lending transactions the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral blackrock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks the failure of blackrock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs separate from the risks of collateral investments and blackrock may be held liable for any failure to manage any such risks 

blackrock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default 

blackrock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients in the event of a borrower default blackrock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan blackrock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered where the collateral is in the form of cash the indemnities blackrock provides do not guarantee assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested the amount of securities on loan as of december 31 2015 and subject to indemnification was 1693 billion blackrock held as agent cash and securities totaling 1796 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31 2015 significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged andor increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time or the inability to provide support may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock may at its option from time to time support investment products through capital or other credit support such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes losses on such support as well as regulatory restrictions on the company’s ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause blackrock’s aum liquidity and earnings to decline as well as harm its prospects for growth 

blackrock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors including its ability to maintain and grow aum its creditworthiness and operating cash flows failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force blackrock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives blackrock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt or secure lines of credit or commercial paper backup lines on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions a reduction in its long or shortterm credit ratings or changes in government regulations including tax and interest rates failure to obtain funds andor financing or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds andor financing may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth 

fraud or the circumvention of controls and risk management policies could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

although blackrock has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks it cannot assure that such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to its businesses blackrock is subject to the risk that its employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with the company’s controls policies and procedures persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation which could cause costly regulatory inquiries fines andor sanctions and may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose blackrock to additional costs or operational risk  

blackrock’s financial performance depends in part on its ability to develop market and manage new investment products and services the development and introduction of new products and services require continued innovative efforts on the part of blackrock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements a failure to continue to innovate to introduce new products and services or to successfully manage the risks associated with such products and services may cause blackrock’s costs to fluctuate which may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the company’s ability to plan for the future longterm growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within blackrock the market for qualified fund managers investment analysts technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive and factors that affect blackrock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the company’s reputation the compensation and benefits it provides and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession including the development and training of qualified individuals blackrock’s ability to attract and retain talent may also be affected if european regulations instituting bonus caps or limiting the amount of compensation that asset managers can pay to certain employees are enacted in the varying formats in which they have been proposed 

in addition a percentage of the deferred compensation that blackrock pays to its employees is tied to the company’s share price as such if blackrock’s share price were to decrease materially the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession if blackrock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession the company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted 

future inorganic transactions may harm the company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful 

blackrock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings increase product offerings access new clients leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies inorganic strategies have included hiring smallersized investment teams and acquiring investment management businesses and other small and mediumsized companies inorganic transactions involve a number of financial accounting tax regulatory geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties including in some cases the assumption of preexisting liabilities any failure to identify and mitigate these risks through due diligence and indemnification provisions could adversely impact blackrock’s reputation may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline and may harm the company’s competitive position in the investment management industry moreover there can be no assurances that blackrock will be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from future inorganic transactions 

investments in real assets such as real estate infrastructure and energy assets may expose blackrock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities as well as reputational harm 

investments in real assets including real estate infrastructure and energy assets may expose blackrock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets these may include



















the above risks may expose blackrock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities including costs associated with delays or remediation costs and increased legal or regulatory costs all of which could impact the returns earned by blackrock’s clients these risks could also result in direct liability for blackrock by exposing blackrock to regulatory sanction or litigation including claims for compensatory or punitive damages similarly market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which blackrock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of blackrock’s clients the occurrence of any such events may expose blackrock to reputational harm divert management’s time and attention away from blackrock’s business activities or cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

operating in international markets increases blackrock’s operational political regulatory and other risks 

as a result of blackrock’s extensive international operations the company faces associated operational regulatory reputational political and foreign exchange rate risks many of which are outside of the company’s control the failure of the company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines andor sanctions which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

 

risks related to key thirdparty relationships

disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to blackrock’s exchange traded fund “etf” platform may adversely affect the prices at which etfs trade particularly during periods of market volatility

regulatory reforms in the united states and internationally expose blackrock and its clients to increasing regul atory scrutiny 

in recent years a number of proposals for regulatory reform have been introduced and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which blackrock is subject is expected to increase see “item 1 – business – regulation” a number of regulatory reforms that have been proposed may require blackrock to alter its business or operating activities which could be timeconsuming and costly and which may impede the company’s growth and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline regulatory reform may also impact blackrock’s banking insurance company and pension fund clients which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to blackrock key regulatory reforms that may impact the company include 





 













 





legal proceedings may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the company certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with blackrock’s activities certain of blackrock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities including the sec federal reserve occ dol cftc and fca similarly from time to time blackrock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various us and nonus governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industrywide companyspecific or other investigations or proceedings these examinations inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future if compliance failures or other violations are found cause the relevant regulator to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations any such action may also result in litigation by investors in blackrock’s funds other blackrock clients or by blackrock’s shareholders which could harm the company’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the company being liable for damages 

in addition when clients retain blackrock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that blackrock must observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose blackrock to lawsuits harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts 

as blackrock’s business continues to grow the company must routinely address conflicts of interest as well as the perception of conflicts of interest between itself and its clients employees or vendors in addition the sec and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts blackrock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues however appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the company fails or appears to fail to appropriately deal with any conflict of interest it may face reputational damage litigation regulatory proceedings or penalties fines andor sanctions any of which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities 

as described in “item 1businessregulation” pnc owns approximately 22 of blackrock’s capital stock based on the federal reserve’s interpretation of the bhc act the federal reserve takes the position that this ownership interest causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for purposes of the bhc act thereby subjecting blackrock to banking regulation including the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that a nonbank subsidiary may conduct the federal reserve has broad enforcement authority over nonbank subsidiaries including the power to prohibit them from conducting any activity that in the federal reserve’s opinion is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations pnc is regulated as a “financial holding company” under the bhc act which allows pnc and blackrock to engage in a much broader set of activities than would otherwise be permitted under the bhc act any failure of pnc to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain blackrock activities and its growth 

in addition blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary which is organized as a national bank is separately subject to banking regulation by the occ the occ has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary and also subjects it to capital requirements being subject to banking regulation may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations 

failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

of note among the various international regulations to which blackrock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels thresholds across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the company the specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions blackrock continues to invest in technology training and its employees to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures despite these investments the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions will occasionally occur in the future any such errors may expose blackrock to monetary penalties which could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

new tax legislation or changes in us and foreign tax laws treaties and regulations or challenges to blackrock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate business and overall financial condition 

blackrock’s businesses may be affected by new tax legislation or regulations or the modification of existing tax laws regulations and rulings by us or nonus authorities in particular fatca and the crs have introduced new investor onboarding withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring persons with financial assets outside of their tax residence country pay appropriate taxes fatca and crs will impact both us and nonus funds and subject blackrock to additional administrative burdens similarly certain eu member states have enacted ftts which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instrument and derivatives transactions several other eu member states continue to discuss introducing ftts if introduced as proposed ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s financial results and on clients’ performance results in addition in october 2015 the oecd released its final beps package in an effort to curb the use of certain tax regimes and elements of tax planning primarily in a crossborder context the final package was endorsed by the g20 and is subject to implementation beps contains a number of provisions that may negatively impact crossborder investing using commingled investment vehicles in addition in january 2016 the european commission announced an antitax avoidance package “eu package” for consideration by the european parliament and council containing measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning further and to boost tax transparency once implemented the beps package and the eu package could curtail the amount of investments channeled by and have unintended taxation consequences for funds as well as the blackrock’s overall tax position which could adversely affect blackrock’s financial condition and that of its clients 

the company also manages significant assets in products and accounts that have specific tax objectives which could be adversely impacted by changes in tax law or policy particularly with respect to us municipal income the us individual income tax rate on qualified dividends and longterm capital gains and globally alternative products the application of complex tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge blackrock’s historical tax positions these challenges may result in adjustments to blackrock’s tax position or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition

nongaap financial measures 

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with gaap however management believes evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators for both management and investors of blackrock’s financial performance over time management also uses nongaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented nongaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock’s revenue and expense blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 

management uses both gaap and nongaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock’s financial performance adjustments to gaap financial measures “nongaap adjustments” include certain items management deems nonrecurring or occur infrequently transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow 

computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows 

1 operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted 

management believes operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time and therefore provide useful disclosure to investors 

 



 





revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services which due to the terms of the contracts are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time substantially offset distribution fee revenue the company earns for each of these items blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue 

2 nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted 

nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted equals nonoperating income expense gaap basis less net income loss attributable to nci adjusted for compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans the compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income this compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans which are reported in nonoperating income expense gaap basis 

during 2013 the noncash nonoperating pretax gain of 80 million related to the contributed pennymac investment was excluded from nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature and because the more than offsetting associated charitable contribution expense of 124 million is reported in operating income 

 



 

3 n et income attributable to blackrock as adjusted 

 



 

see the aforementioned discussion regarding operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted for information on the pnc ltip funding obligation and the charitable contribution 

for each period presented the nongaap adjustment related to the pnc ltip funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments amounts for 2013 included a tax benefit of approximately 48 million recognized in connection with the charitable contribution the tax benefit has been excluded from net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted due to the nonrecurring nature of the charitable contribution 

nongaap income tax matters adjustments for 2015 2014 and 2013 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities the amount for 2015 included a 54 million net noncash benefit primarily related to the impact of legislation enacted in the united kingdom and state and local income tax changes the amount for 2014 included a 9 million net noncash tax benefit arising primarily from state and local income tax changes the amount for 2013 included a 69 million noncash tax benefit primarily related to the impact of legislation enacted in the united kingdom and state and local income tax changes such amounts for 2015 2014 and 2013 have been excluded from as adjusted results as they will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented

net market appreciation of 2617 billion included 1408 billion of growth in equity products primarily due to higher us equity markets and appreciation of 988 billion and 210 billion in fixed income and multiasset products respectively across the majority of strategies 

aum decreased 1277 billion from foreign exchange movements primarily resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro the british pound and the japanese yen 

 

 

discussion of financial results 

introduction 

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets additional fundings from existing clients including dividend reinvestment withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on and changes in the fair value of securities held in client accounts foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating nonus dollar denominated aum into us dollars for reporting purposes 

blackrock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and brokerdealers the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities generally the revenue earned is shared between blackrock and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed historically securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand 

investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative andor absolute investment performance in addition to base fees based on aum investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold as such the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of blackrock’s revenue and earnings the magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products however the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either september 30 or december 31 

blackrock provides a variety of risk management investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions pension funds asset managers foundations consultants mutual fund sponsors real estate investment trusts and government agencies these services are provided under the brand name blackrock solutions and include a wide array of risk management services valuation services related to illiquid securities disposition and workout assignments including longterm portfolio liquidation assignments strategic planning and execution and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients the company’s aladdin operating platform serves as the investmentrisk solutions system for blackrock and other institutional investors fees earned for blackrock solutions and advisory services are determined using some or all of the following methods i percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform ii fixed fees and iii performance fees if contractual thresholds are met

approximately 75 of the company’s revenue is generated in us dollars the company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies primarily the euro and british pound are impacted by foreign exchange rates any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the company’s considerable nondollar expense base related to its operations outside the united states 

nonoperating income expense includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments excluding availableforsale investments and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to availableforsale investments blackrock primarily holds seed and coinvestments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including private equity hedge funds and real estate investments generally are made for coinvestment purposes to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes including federal reserve bank stock blackrock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k 

consolidation

in the normal course of business the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles the company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a vie or a vre assessing whether an entity is a vie or a vre involves judgment and analysis factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company’s involvement with the entity investments that are determined to be vres are consolidated if the company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which generally exists if there is greater than 50 voting interest see note 4 consolidated voting right entities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for more information investments that are determined to be vies are consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary “pb” of the entity

at december 31 2015 blackrock was determined to be the pb for certain investment products that were determined to be vies which required blackrock to consolidate them blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie see note 5 variable interest entities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for more information

see note 2 significant accounting policies — accounting pronouncements adopted in 2015  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for more information on asu 201502

investments 

equity method investments  for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where it is not the pb of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company follows the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity 

blackrock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value therefore under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income expense for investments in investment companies or as other revenue for certain strategic investments which are recorded in other assets since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock’s core business 

at december 31 2015 the company had 527 million and 265 million of equity method investments including equity method investments held for deferred compensation reflected within investments and other assets respectively and at december 31 2014 the company had 654 million and 208 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets respectively 

impairments of investments management periodically assesses equity method availableforsale heldtomaturity and cost investments for otherthantemporary impairment “otti” if an otti exists an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income expense on the consolidated statements of the income 

for equity method heldtomaturity and cost method investments if circumstances indicate that an otti may exist the investments are evaluated using market values where available or the expected future cash flows of the investment if the company determines an otti exists an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value 

for availableforsale securities when the fair value is lower than cost the company considers among other factors the length of time the security has been in a loss position the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses for equity securities if the impairment is considered otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value for debt securities the company considers whether 1 it has the intent to sell the security 2 it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or 3 it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security if the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the 

security the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value must be recognized in earnings if the company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required t o sell the security but the security has suffered a n impairment related to credit the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total decline in value and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

 

for the company’s investments in clos the company reviews cash flow estimates over the life of each clo investment on a quarterly basis if the present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows an impairment is considered to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value

evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 

fair value measurements 

the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for more information on fair value measurements 

changes in valuation changes in value on 2261 million of total investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense 44 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income 203 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 100 million relates to carried interest which will not impact nonoperating income expense at december 31 2015 changes in fair value of approximately 1649 million of such consolidated viesvres will impact blackrock’s net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was 1268 million

the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary openend investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost in addition trade namestrademarks are considered indefinitelived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with the applicable provisions of asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other “asc 350” indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2015 ranged from 1 to 9 years with a weightedaverage remaining estimated useful life of 37 years 

goodwill the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment assessment performed as of july 31 2015 indicated no impairment charge was required the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2015 the company’s common stock closed at 34052 which exceeded its book value of approximately 17212 per share 

 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinitelife and finitelife classifications are still appropriate 

 

in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is less than carrying value blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates in addition the company considered other factors including i macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or other developments in equity and credit markets ii industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates an increased competitive environment a decline in marketdependent multiples or metrics a change in the market for an entity’s services or regulatory legal or political developments and iii entityspecific events such as a change in management or key personnel overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset if an indefinitelived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs

for finitelived intangible assets if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform a recoverability test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 128 million 157 million and 161 million for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

in 2015 2014 and 2013 the company performed impairment tests including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments the company determined that no impairment charges were required the classification of indefinitelived versus 

finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles were requi red the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

income taxes

deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2015 blackrock had 466 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 320 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2015 the company had deferred tax assets of 20 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately 4851 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company 

the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard the assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately 166 million and current income taxes payables of 79 million at december 31 2015 

revenue recognition

investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or in the case of certain real estate clients net operating income generated by the underlying properties investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers 

the company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the company manages such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund in certain cases the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the company bears no credit risk to the thirdparty the company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with asc 60545 revenue recognition — principal agent considerations “asc 60545” and records its management fees net of retrocessions retrocessions for 2015 2014 and 2013 were 870 million 891 million and 785 million respectively the company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which due to the terms of the contracts are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income 

the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and brokerdealers revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis the securities loaned are secured by collateral generally ranging from 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities generally the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed for 2015 2014 and 2013 securities lending revenue earned by the company totaled 513 million 477 million and 447 million respectively and is recorded in investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee 

the company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations from certain actively managed investment funds and certain smas these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which varies by product or account and could be monthly quarterly annually or longer 

in addition the company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds blackrock may be required to reversereturn all or part of such carried interest allocations depending upon future performance of these funds therefore blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in total investments or cashcash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable 

the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2015 and 2014 the company had 143 million and 105 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilitiesother liabilities of consolidated vies on the consolidated statements of financial condition a portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue if any for these products is unknown 

the following table presents changes in the deferred carried interest liability in cluding the portion related to consolidated vies for 2015 and 2014 

 



 

for 2015 2014 and 2013 performance fee revenue totaled 621 million 550 million and 561 million respectively 

fees earned for blackrock solutions  which include advisory services are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some or all of the following methods i percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform ii fixed fees and iii performance fees if contractual thresholds are met revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of onetime advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on aum of the respective portfolio assignment for 2015 2014 and 2013 blackrock solutions and advisory revenue totaled 646 million 635 million and 577 million respectively 

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance revenue until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable

component changes in aum by product type for the five years ended december 31 2014 are presented below 

 

  

   

aum represents the broad ranges of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing for example net asset value reported aum does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice or assets that we are retained to manage on a shortterm temporary basis

proprietary aladdin investment system as well as risk management outsourcing and advisory services to institutional investors under the brs name revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions number of users accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives 

at december 31 2014 total aum was 4652 trillion representing a cagr of 7 over the last five years aum growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains net new business and acquisitions including claymore and srpep which added 137 billion of aum in 2012 and credit suisse and mgpa which collectively added 269 billion of aum in 2013 our aum mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range as described below

aum by investment style and client type at december 31 2014 is presented below 

 

 retail 

  

blackrock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the active and passive spectrum including separate accounts openend and closedend funds unit trusts and private investment funds retail investors are served principally through intermediaries including brokerdealers banks trust companies insurance companies and independent financial advisors clients invest primarily in mutual funds which totaled 4402 

billion or 82 of retail longterm aum at yearend with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts “smas” the majority 93 of longterm retail aum is invested in active products although this is impacted by ishares being shown separately retail represented 12 of longterm aum at december 31 2014 and 35 of longterm base fees for 2014 

 

 

component changes in retail aum for 2014 are presented below 

 

   

the retail client base is diversified geographically with 71 of longterm aum managed for investors based in the americas 23 in emea and 6 in asiapacific at yearend 2014 

 



  



 

 

 

ishares 

ishares is the leading etf provider in the world with 10 trillion of aum at december 31 2014 and was the top asset gatherer globally in 2014 1 with 1006 billion of net inflows for an organic growth rate of 11 equity net inflows of 596 billion were driven by flows into the core series and into funds with broad us equity market exposures partially offset by outflows from emerging markets products fixed income net inflows of 400 billion were diversified across exposures and product lines with europeanlisted ishares raising 166 billion or 41 of fixed income net inflows ishares multiasset class and alternatives funds contributed a combined 10 billion of net inflows primarily into commodities ishares represented 24 of longterm aum at december 31 2014 and 35 of longterm base fees for 2014 

component changes in ishares aum for 2014 are presented below 

 

  

   

our broad ishares product range offers investors a precise transparent and efficient way to tap market returns and gain access to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult for many investors to access as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and costefficiently 

 



 institutional 

blackrock’s institutional aum is well diversified by both product and region and we serve institutional investors on six continents in subcategories including pensions endowments and foundations official institutions and financial institutions 

 

  



 

component changes in institutional aum for 2014 are presented below 

 

  

 

institutional active aum ended 2014 at 9592 billion up 268 billion or 3 since yearend 2013 institutional active represented 22 of longterm aum and 20 of longterm base fees growth in aum reflected continued strength in multiasset class products with net inflows of 158 billion largely from defined contribution plans into target date offerings multiasset class net inflows were offset by equity net outflows of 186 billion with 63 of outflows coming from fundamental strategies fixed income net outflows of 69 billion were primarily due to several large clientspecific asset allocation decisions and corporate actions such as client acquisitions these events offset positive momentum in credit mandates alternatives net outflows of 07 billion included 31 billion of return of capital excluding return of capital alternatives net inflows of 24 billion were led by inflows into hedge fund and private equity solutions 

institutional index aum totaled 1816 trillion at december 31 2014 reflecting net inflows of 361 billion flows were led by fixed income with net inflows of 263 billion primarily into local currency us targeted duration and global bond mandates reflecting solutionsbased ldi activity and portfolio rebalancing equities saw net inflows of 99 billion primarily into global mandates as clients increasingly looked to use passive vehicles for broad macro exposure institutional index represented 42 of longterm aum at december 31 2014 and accounted for 10 of longterm base fees for 2014 

the company’s institutional clients consist of the following 

 



  

  



 

product type 

component changes in aum by product type and investment style for 2014 are presented below 

 

  

 

longterm product offerings include active and index strategies our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile we offer two types of active strategies those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction in contrast index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index index strategies include both our nonetf index products and ishares etfs 

although many clients use both active and index strategies the application of these strategies may differ for example clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class in addition institutional nonetf index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and typically reflect low fee rates this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

equity 

yearend 2014 equity aum of 2451 trillion increased by 1334 billion or 6 from the end of 2013 due to net new business of 524 billion and net market appreciation and foreign exchange movements of 810 billion net inflows were driven by 596 billion and 177 billion into ishares and nonetf index accounts respectively index inflows were offset by active net outflows of 249 billion with outflows of 180 billion and 69 billion from fundamental and scientific active equity products respectively 

blackrock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix approximately half of blackrock’s equity aum is 

tied to international markets including emerging markets which tend to have higher fee rates than similar us equity strategies accordingly fluctuations in international equity markets which do not consistently move in tandem with us markets may have a greater impact on blackrock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues

securities lending 

securities lending is managed by a dedicated team supported by quantitative analysis proprietary technology and disciplined risk management the cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings andor as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral the value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the corresponding asset class being managed the value of the collateral is not included in aum 

outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately 187 billion up from 156 billion at yearend 2013 liability spreads declined from 2013 levels as the proportion of “special collateral” securities commanding premium lending fees declined due to low idiosyncratic risk low single stock volatility and lack of ma activity 

blackrock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality liquidity and interest rate risk management disciplined risk management including a rigorous credit surveillance process is an integral part of the investment process blackrock’s cash management credit committee has established risk limits such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits across many of the products blackrock manages including over all of its cash management products in the ordinary course of our business there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed no such instances individually or in the aggregate have been material to the company to the extent that daily evaluationreporting of the profile of the portfolios 

 

 

 

identifies that a limit has been exceeded the relevant portfolio will be adjusted to the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers while a risk limit may be waived such temporary waivers are infrequent 

risk  quantitative analysis 

across all asset classes in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams the risk  quantitative analysis “rqa” group at blackrock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and thirdparty data to identify measure and manage a wide range of risks rqa provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk managementrelated analytical and information requirements where appropriate rqa will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics

regulation 

virtually all aspects of blackrock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world some of which are summarized below these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients investors in registered and unregistered investment companies trust customers of blackrock institutional trust company na “btc” pnc and its bank subsidiaries and their customers and the financial system under these laws and regulations agencies that regulate investment advisers investment funds and bank holding companies and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers including the power to limit restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time revocation of investment adviser and other registrations censures and fines both for individuals and the company 

the rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical accordingly the discussion below is general in nature does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report 

global regulatory reform 

blackrock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives around the world any such initiative or any new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities lead to business disruptions require blackrock to change certain business practices and expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and legal costs as well as reputational harm blackrock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce 

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “dfa” was signed into law in the united states the dfa is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions many of which have been adopted as the impact of these rules will become evident over time it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that the dfa or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions will have upon blackrock’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

 

systemically important financial institution review 

under the dfa blackrock could be designated a systemically important financial institution “sifi” and become subject to direct supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” on july 31 2014 the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” principals directed the staff to undertake a more focused analysis of industrywide products and activities to assess potential risks associated with the asset management industry and on december 18 2014 the fsoc issued a request for information related to this analysis 

in addition on january 8 2014 the financial stability board “fsb” and the international organisation of securities commissions “iosco” issued a consultative document on proposed methodologies to identify nonbanknoninsurance global systemically important financial institutions “gsifi” a second fsbiosco consultation is expected to be released in the near future 

if blackrock were designated a sifi or gsifi it could become subject to enhanced prudential capital supervisory and other requirements such as riskbased capital requirements leverage limits liquidity requirements resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements concentration limits a contingent capital requirement enhanced public disclosures shortterm debt limits and overall risk management requirements requirements such as these which were designed to regulate banking institutions would likely need to be modified to be applicable to an asset manager such as blackrock no proposals have been made indicating how such measures would be adapted for asset managers 

securities and exchange commission review of asset managers 

blackrock’s business may also be impacted by securities and exchange commission “sec” regulatory initiatives for example on december 11 2014 the chair of the sec announced that she is recommending that the sec enhance its oversight of asset managers by i expanding and updating data requirements with which asset managers must comply ii improving fund level controls including those related to liquidity levels and the nature of specific instruments and iii ensuring that asset management firms have appropriate transition plans in place to deal with market stress events or situations where an investment adviser is no longer able to serve its clients although these recommendations have not yet resulted in any proposed rules any additional sec oversight or the introduction of any new reporting disclosure or control requirements could expose blackrock to additional compliance costs and may require the company to change how it operates its business 

money market fund reform 

in july 2014 the sec adopted rule amendments designed to reform the regulatory structure governing money market funds and to address the perceived systemic risks that such funds present the new rules require institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds to employ a floating net asset value method of pricing which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the marketbased value of fund assets the rules also provide for new tools for the funds’ boards designed to address liquidity shocks including liquidity fees and redemption gates the rules do not apply to government 

nonmunicipal and retail money market funds except that retail money market funds must comply with liquidity fees and redemption gate requirements the potential impact of the rules that affect the structure of the funds which have a twoyear compliance period on blackrock’s business remains untested they may however reduce the attractiveness of certain money market funds to investors 

regulation of derivatives 

the sec the internal revenue service “irs” and the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” each continue to review the use of futures swaps and other derivatives by mutual funds such reviews could result in regulations that further limit the use of such products by mutual funds if adopted these limitations could require blackrock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the cftc which could result in additional costs andor restrictions blackrock also reports certain information about a number of its private funds to the sec and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the cftc under systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies these reporting obligations have required and will continue to require investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting 

further the full implementation of regulations under the dfa relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives will impact the manner in which blackrockadvised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives increasing the costs of derivatives trading for blackrock’s clients for example cftc and eventually sec rules and regulations applicable to offshore funds accounts and counterparties will require blackrock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it will be subject these rule changes also introduce new requirements for centrally clearing certain swap and eventually securitybased swap transactions and for executing certain swap and eventually securitybased swap transactions on or through cftc or secregistered trading venues jurisdictions outside the united states in which blackrock operates also have adopted and implemented or are in the process of considering adopting or implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could further impact blackrock and the broader markets this includes the implementation of mandated central clearing of swaps in the european union “eu” and the implementation of trade reporting documentation central clearing and other requirements in various jurisdictions globally 

regulation of etfs 

globally regulators are examining the potential risks in etfs and may impose additional regulations on etfs depending on the outcome of this analysis these products may be restricted in some ways and may require blackrock to incur additional compliance expenses which may adversely affect the company’s business 

benchmark reform 

the iosco published principles for regulatory oversight of financial benchmarks in 2013 with standards applying to methodologies for benchmark calculation and transparency and governance issues in the benchmarking process some national and regional regulators are currently reviewing how 

 

 

 

to apply these principles with a draft european regulation published in september 2013 similarly in july 2014 the fsb published a report aimed at reforming major interest rate benchmarks these regulations may result in business disruptions which could adversely impact the value of assets in which asset managers including blackrock have invested directly or on behalf of their clients to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms could make it more difficult for blackrock to conduct certain businesses 

taxation 

blackrock’s global business may be impacted by the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” which was enacted in 2010 and introduced expansive new investor onboarding withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring us persons with financial assets outside of the united states pay appropriate taxes in many instances however the precise nature of what needs to be implemented will be governed by bilateral intergovernmental agreements “igas” between the united states and the countries in which blackrock does business while many of these igas have been put into place others have yet to be concluded the fatca rules will impact both us and nonus funds and subject blackrock to extensive additional administrative burdens the organization for economic cooperation and development has also recently launched a base erosion and profit shifting “beps” proposal that aims to rationalize tax treatment across jurisdictions if the beps proposal becomes the subject of legislative action in the format proposed it could have unintended taxation consequences for collective investment vehicles and the company’s tax position which could adversely affect blackrock’s financial condition 

in addition certain individual eu member states such as france and italy have enacted national financial transaction taxes “ftts” there has also been renewed momentum by several other member states to introduce ftts which would impose taxation on a broad range of financial instrument and derivatives transactions in general any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would impact investors and would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that we manage in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products an ftt could significantly increase the operational costs of our entering into on behalf of our clients securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to an ftt which could adversely impact our financial results and clients’ performance results 

blackrock’s business could also be impacted to the extent there are other changes to tax laws for example the administration recently announced its proposed us federal budget which called for new industry fees for financial firms to the extent such fees are adopted and found to apply to blackrock they could adversely affect the company’s financial results 

regulation of securities lending 

in its 2014 annual report the fsoc identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring in addition in january 2015 the european parliament published its draft report on the european commission’s proposal for a european regulation on the reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions “sft” 

the sft regulation aims to improve the transparency surrounding sfts and limit the perceived risks of sfts by among other things requiring central reporting of sfts requiring disclosure of sfts to investors and imposing minimum requirements relating to the difference in prices at which a market maker can buy and sell a security in sfts if the recent scrutiny of securities lending practices results in new regulatory requirements or reporting obligations blackrock may be required to modify its securities lending activities or introduce additional compliance measures which will subject the company to additional expenses 

volcker rule 

provisions of the dfa referred to as the “volcker rule” place limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds including hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds collectively “covered funds” because the federal reserve currently treats blackrock as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc blackrock may be required to conform its activities to the requirements of the volcker rule the volcker rule’s restrictions would among other things limit blackrock’s ability to invest in covered funds and require blackrock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds which could subject the company to additional expense the volcker rule may also require blackrock to sell certain seed and coinvestments that it holds in covered funds potentially at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions the volcker rule may also reduce the level of market making and liquidity activities of several of blackrock’s trading counterparties which may adversely impact the liquidity and in some cases the pricing of various financial instruments in which blackrock client accounts invest for a further discussion of the volcker rule see “item 1a — risk factors — legal and regulatory risks” 

markets in financial instrument directives 

blackrock is also subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives in europe for example after the united kingdom and other european jurisdictions in which blackrock has a presence implemented the markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” rules described more particularly under “— european regulation” below into national legislation these jurisdictions recently began the additional process of implementing mifid 2 and a new markets in financial instruments regulation mifid 2 builds upon many of the initiatives introduced through mifid which focused primarily on equities to encourage trading across all asset classes to migrate on to open and transparent markets mifid 2 which will come into full effect in january 2017 will be implemented through a number of more detailed directives regulations and technical standards to be made by the european commission and by the european securities and markets authority “esma” it is expected that mifid 2 will have significant and wideranging impacts on eu securities and derivatives markets in particular there will be i enhanced governance and investor protection standards ii prescriptive rules on portfolio management firms’ ability to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes iii enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading iv the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives on to regulated execution venues v the extension of pre and posttrade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments vi restrictions on the use of socalled dark pool trading vii the creation of a new type of trading venue called the 

 

 

 

organized trading facility for nonequity financial instruments viii commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements ix a move away from vertical silos in execution clearing and settlement x an enhanced role for esma in supervising eu securities and derivatives markets and xi new requirements regarding noneu investment firms’ access to eu financial markets implementation of these measures will have direct and indirect impacts on the company and its subsidiaries and may require significant changes to client servicing models 

alternative investment fund managers directive 

blackrock’s european business is impacted by the eu alternative investment fund managers directive “aifmd” which became effective on july 21 2011 the aifmd regulates managers of and service providers to a broad range of alternative investment funds “aifs” domiciled within and depending on the precise circumstances outside the eu the aifmd also regulates the marketing of all aifs inside the european economic area “eea” the aifmd is being implemented in stages which run through 2018 compliance with the aifmd’s requirements restrict alternative investment fund marketing and impose additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration capital requirements leverage valuation stakes in eu companies depositaries the domicile of custodians and liquidity management on blackrock these new compliance and disclosure obligations and the associated risk management and reporting requirements will subject blackrock to additional expenses 

undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities 

the eu has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities “ucits” as regards depositary functions remuneration policies and sanctions the latest initiative in this area ucits v which became effective in september 2014 seeks to align the depositary regime remuneration rules and sanctioning powers of regulators under the ucits directive with the requirements of the aifmd ucits v is required to be adopted in the national law of each eu member state during the second quarter of 2016 similarly in august 2014 esma revised the guidelines it initially published in 2012 on etfs and other ucits funds the guidelines introduced new collateral management requirements for ucits funds concerning collateral received in the context of derivatives using efficient portfolio management “epm” techniques including securities 

lending and overthecounter derivative transactions these rules which are now in effect required blackrock to make a series of changes to its collateral management arrangements applicable to the epm of its ucits fund ranges compliance with the ucits directives will cause blackrock to incur additional expenses associated with new risk management and reporting requirements 

extension of retail distribution review 

blackrock must also comply with newly implemented retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections overhauling mutual fund fee structures and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector the rules were originally introduced in the united kingdom and have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where blackrock operates similarly mifid 2 will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other 

nonmonetary benefits from fund managers these rules if implemented may lead to changes to the fees and commissions blackrock is able to charge to its clients as well as to its client servicing and distribution models

blackrock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company under the bhc act investment management is an authorized activity but must be conducted within applicable regulatory 

requirements which in some cases are more restrictive than those blackrock faces under applicable securities laws blackrock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory administrative or other services only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations based on the federal reserve’s position that blackrock is a nonbank subsidiary of pnc the federal reserve has broad powers to approve deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for blackrock to conduct new activities acquire or divest businesses or assets or reconfigure existing operations and there are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of pnc to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with blackrock or its funds pnc and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of blackrock’s businesses furthermore the federal reserve has broad enforcement authority over nonbank subsidiaries including the power to prohibit them from conducting any activity that in the federal reserve’s opinion is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice the federal reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws regulations and orders the dfa strengthened the federal reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s nonbank subsidiaries 

any failure of pnc to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain blackrock activities and its growth such a change of status could be caused by any failure of pnc or one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” by any examination downgrade of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries or by any failure of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act

 item 1a risk factors 

as a leading investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks while blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify measure monitor manage and analyze market operating and compliance risks blackrock’s business financial condition operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties including the ones discussed below 

market and competition risks 

changes in the value levels of equity debt real estate commodities currency or other asset markets could cause assets under management “aum” revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client numerous factors including price movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real estate commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests could cause 

 

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of any of these events may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from its investment advisory business the advisory or management contracts blackrock has entered into with its clients including the agreements that govern many of blackrock’s investment funds provide investors or in some cases the independent directors of private investment funds with significant latitude to terminate such contracts withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty or to remove blackrock as the funds’ investment advisor or equivalent blackrock also manages its us mutual funds closedend and exchangetraded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors a majority of whom are independent from the company if a number of blackrock’s clients terminate their contracts remove blackrock from advisory roles liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms the fees or carried interest blackrock earns could be reduced which may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

increased competition may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry blackrock competes based on a number of factors including investment performance the level of fees charged the quality and diversity of services and products provided name recognition and reputation and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors increased competition on the basis of any of these factors including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the impairment or failure of other financial institutions may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages to many different industries and counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial and investment banks clearing organizations mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients transactions with counterparties expose the products and accounts blackrock manages to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults although blackrock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may otherwise fail to meet their obligations to blackrock any such impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts managed by blackrock which could lead to the loss of clients and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause aum in similar blackrock products to decline irrespective of blackrock’s performance 

many competitors offer similar products to those offered by blackrock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar blackrock products irrespective of the performance 

 

 

 

of such products any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

changes in the value of seed and coinvestments that blackrock owns could affect our nonoperating income and could increase the volatility of our earnings 

at december 31 2014 blackrock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately 13 billion in its investments see “item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsinvestments” primarily resulted from coinvestments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds movements in the equity debt or currency markets or in the price of real estate commodities or alternative investments could lower the value of these investments increase the volatility of blackrock’s earnings and may cause earnings to decline 

risks related to investment performance 

poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

the company’s management believes that investment performance including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of aum poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could cause aum revenue and earnings to decline as a result of 

 

  

  

  

  

 performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings 

a portion of blackrock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments performance fees represented 550 million or 5 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 generally the company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement pursuant to which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded a performance fee for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods which could cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure to identify errors in the quantitative models blackrock utilizes to manage its business could adversely impact product performance and client relationships 

blackrock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions and allocations including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading 

and hedging activities and product valuations any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on blackrock’s business and reputation 

technology and operational risks 

a failure in blackrock’s operational systems or infrastructure including business continuity plans could disrupt operations damage the company’s reputation and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s infrastructure including its technological capacity data centers and office space is vital to the competitiveness of its business moreover a significant portion of blackrock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas including san francisco new york london and gurgaon the failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of blackrock’s business or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside blackrock’s control including a major earthquake hurricane fire terrorist act pandemic or other catastrophic event in any location at which blackrock maintains a major presence could materially impact operations result in disruption to the business or impede its growth notwithstanding blackrock’s efforts to ensure business continuity if it fails to keep business continuity plans uptodate or if such plans including secure backup facilities and systems and the availability of backup employees are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption the company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which could cause aum revenue and earnings to decline or could impact the company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm regulatory fines and sanctions 

failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cyber security policies procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a hacker attack virus or worm or an internally caused issue such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information and could result in material financial loss loss of competitive position regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure to maintain aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the sophisticated risk analytics that blackrock provides via the aladdin technology platform to support investment advisory and brs clients are a key element to blackrock’s competitive success blackrock relies on its ability as well as the ability of a number of third parties who provide it with various types of data and software to maintain a robust and 

 

 

 

secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the aladdin platform the failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and brs clients in addition there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to deliver a competitive product in a dynamic market for risk analytics or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes 

operating risks associated with blackrock’s securities lending program may result in client losses and in certain circumstances potential financial liabilities for the company 

blackrock lends securities to banks and brokerdealers on behalf of certain of its clients in these securities lending transactions the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral blackrock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks the failure of the company’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs separate from the risks of collateral investments additionally in certain circumstances the company could potentially be held liable for the failure to manage any such risks 

blackrock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default 

blackrock indemnifies certain of its securities lending clients for specified losses that might occur upon the default of a borrower these indemnities are designed to cover a client’s potential shortfall where the value of the collateral pledged by a defaulting borrower in connection with a securities lending agreement is less than the amount needed to repurchase the securities loaned to such a defaulting borrower where the collateral is in the form of cash the indemnities blackrock provides do not guarantee assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested the amount of securities on loan as of december 31 2014 and subject to indemnification was 1457 billion blackrock held as agent cash and securities totaling 1558 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31 2014 significant borrower defaults coupled with collateral shortfalls could result in material liabilities under these indemnities which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time or the inability to provide support may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock may at its option from time to time support investment products through capital or other credit support such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes losses on such support as well as regulatory restrictions on our ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause blackrock’s aum liquidity and earnings to decline as well as harm its prospects for growth 

blackrock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors including its ability to maintain and grow aum its creditworthiness and operating cash flows failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force blackrock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives blackrock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt or secure lines of credit or commercial paper backup lines on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions a reduction in its long or shortterm credit ratings as well as changes in government regulations including tax and interest rates failure to obtain funds andor financing or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds andor financing could cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth 

fraud or the circumvention of controls and risk management policies could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

although blackrock has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks it cannot assure that such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to its businesses blackrock is subject to the risk that its employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with the company’s controls policies and procedures persistent or repeated attempts involving fraud conflicts of interests or circumvention of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation which could cause costly regulatory inquiries and may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose blackrock to additional costs or operational risk  

blackrock’s financial performance depends in part on its ability to develop market and manage new investment products and services the development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on the part of blackrock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements a failure to continue to innovate to introduce new products and services or to successfully manage the risks associated with such products and services may cause blackrock’s costs to fluctuate which may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

 

 

 

the failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the company’s ability to plan for the future longterm growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within blackrock the market for qualified fund managers investment analysts financial advisers and other professionals is competitive and factors that affect blackrock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the company’s reputation the compensation and benefits it provides and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession including the development and training of qualified individuals in addition a percentage of the deferred compensation that blackrock pays to its employees is tied to the company’s share price as such if blackrock’s share price were to decrease materially the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession if blackrock is unable to attract and retain talented individuals or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession the company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted 

future inorganic transactions may harm the company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful 

blackrock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings increase product offerings access new clients and expand into new geographies inorganic strategies have included hiring smallersized investment teams and acquiring investment management businesses and other small and mediumsized companies inorganic transactions involve a number of financial accounting tax regulatory and operational challenges and uncertainties including in some cases the assumption of preexisting liabilities any failure to identify and mitigate these risks through due diligence and indemnification provisions could adversely impact blackrock’s reputation may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline and may harm the company’s competitive position in the investment management industry moreover there can be no assurances that blackrock will be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from future inorganic transactions 

operating in international markets increases blackrock’s operational regulatory and other risks 

as a result of blackrock’s extensive international operations the company faces associated operational regulatory reputational political and foreign exchange rate risks many of which are outside of the company’s control the failure of the company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

risks related to blackrock’s key vendor and distribution relationships 

the failure of a key vendor to blackrock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation or business which may cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration accounting custody risk analytics market data market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs the failure or inability of blackrock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could lead to operational and regulatory issues for the company including with respect to certain of its products which could result in reputational harm and may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

any disruption to the company’s distribution channels may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution portfolio administration and servicing for certain blackrock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels in particular blackrock entered into a global distribution agreement with bank of americamerrill lynch in 2006 which is subject to renegotiation at the end of 2016 blackrock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors is material to the company’s future performance if blackrock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully if it experiences an increase in distributionrelated costs or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings may decline 

legal and regulatory risks 

blackrock is subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world

regulatory reforms in the united states and internationally expose blackrock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny 

in recent years a number of proposals for regulatory reform have been introduced and it is expected that the level of 

 

 

 

regulatory scrutiny to which blackrock is subject will continue to increase see “item 1 – business – regulation” a number of regulatory reforms that have been proposed may require blackrock to alter its business or operating activities which could be timeconsuming and costly and which may impede the company’s growth and may cause aum revenue and earnings to decline regulatory reform may also impact blackrock’s banking insurance company and pension fund clients which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to blackrock key regulatory reforms that may impact the company include 

 

  



  

  



 

 

 

  

 legal proceedings could cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the company certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with blackrock’s activities certain of blackrock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities including the sec occ dol cftc and fca similarly from time to time blackrock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various us and nonus governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industrywide companyspecific or other investigations or proceedings these examinations inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future if compliance failures or other violations are found cause the relevant regulator to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations any such action may also result in litigation by investors in blackrock’s funds other blackrock clients or by blackrock’s shareholders which could harm the company’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the company being liable to the funds for damages 

in addition when clients retain blackrock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that blackrock must observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose blackrock to lawsuits harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts any of which could cause the company’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

as blackrock’s business continues to grow the company must routinely address conflicts of interest as well as the perception of conflicts of interest between itself and its clients or employees in addition the sec and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts blackrock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues however appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the company fails or appears to fail to appropriately deal with any conflict of interest it may face reputational damage litigation regulatory proceedings or penalties or other sanctions any of which may cause blackrock’s aum revenue and earnings to decline 

blackrock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities 

as described in “item 1businessregulation” pnc owns approximately 22 of blackrock’s capital stock based on the federal reserve’s interpretation of the bhc act the federal reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for purposes of the bhc act thereby subjecting blackrock to banking regulation including the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that a nonbank subsidiary may conduct the federal reserve has broad enforcement authority over nonbank subsidiaries including the power to prohibit them from conducting any activity that in the federal reserve’s opinion is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations pnc is regulated as a “financial holding company” under the bhc act which allows pnc and blackrock to engage in a much broader set of activities than would otherwise be permitted under the bhc act any failure of pnc to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain blackrock activities and its growth in addition to being subject to capital requirements established by the occ blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary which is organized as a national bank is separately subject to banking regulation by the occ the occ has broad enforcement authority over blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary being subject to banking regulation may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations 

failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

of note among the various international regulations to which blackrock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels thresholds across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the company the specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions blackrock continues to invest in technology training and its employees to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures despite these investments the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions will occasionally occur in the future any such errors may expose blackrock to monetary penalties which 

 

 

 

could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation and may cause its aum revenue and earnings to decline 

new tax legislation or changes in us and foreign tax laws and regulations or challenges to blackrock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate business and overall financial condition 

blackrock’s businesses may be affected by new tax legislation or regulations or the modification of existing tax laws and regulations by us or nonus authorities in particular fatca has introduced expansive new investor onboarding withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring us persons with financial assets outside of the united states pay appropriate taxes the fatca rules will impact both us and nonus funds and subject blackrock to extensive additional administrative burdens similarly there has been renewed momentum by several eu member states to introduce an ftt which would impose taxation on a broad range of financial instrument and derivatives transactions if introduced as proposed ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s financial results and on clients’ performance results in addition the organization for economic cooperation and development recently launched a base erosion and profit shifting proposal that aims to rationalize tax treatment across jurisdictions if the beps proposal becomes the subject of legislative action in the format proposed it could have unintended taxation consequences for collective investment vehicles and the company’s tax position which could adversely affect blackrock’s financial condition 

the company also manages significant assets in products and accounts that have specific tax and aftertax related objectives which could be adversely impacted by changes in tax policy particularly with respect to us municipal income us individual income tax rate on qualified dividends and globally alternative products additionally any new legislation modification or interpretation of tax laws could impact blackrock’s corporate tax position the application of complex tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge blackrock’s historical tax positions these challenges may result in adjustments to blackrock’s tax position or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition

consob also alleges that blackrock declined to provide consob with information and was an obstacle to consob’s investigation blackrock believes it has fully cooperated with consob and it will continue to do so 

while under italian law the potential penalty could be greater than the loss actually avoided blackrock believes that mr bolton ultimately will not be found liable and as a result neither mr bolton nor blackrock will incur any penalty

business outlook 

blackrock’s highly diversified multiproduct platform was created to meet the needs of its clients in all market environments blackrock is positioned to provide active and index investment solutions across asset classes and geographies and leverage blackrock solutions’ worldclass risk management analytics and advisory capabilities on behalf of clients blackrock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe including investors in ishares etfs maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus 

blackrock’s retail strategy is focused on an outcomeoriented approach to creating client solutions including active index and alternative products and enhanced distribution in the united states blackrock is leveraging its integrated wholesaler force to further penetrate wirehouse distribution platforms and gain share amongst registered investment advisors internationally blackrock continues to diversify the range of investment solutions available to clients penetrate new distribution channels and capitalize on regulatory change impacting retrocession arrangements 

ishares growth strategy is centered on increasing global ishares market share and driving global market expansion blackrock will seek to achieve these goals by pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments including core investments financial instruments and precision exposures 

blackrock believes institutional results will be driven by strength in specialty areas including defined contribution financial institutions official institutions and foundations family offices and endowments deepening client relationships through effective crossselling efforts enhancing blackrock’s solutionsoriented approach and leveraging blackrock solutions’ analytical and risk management expertise 

assuming a stable market environment blackrock anticipates that organic growth coupled with the benefits of scale should result in increasing operating margins over time 

 

 

 

blackrock believes that earnings growth and shareholder returns should also be positively impacted by the company’s commitment to a consistent and predictable capital management strategy 

nongaap financial measures 

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with gaap however management believes evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if 

investors have additional nongaap financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators for both management and investors of blackrock’s financial performance over time blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 

 

 

computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows 

1 operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted 

operating income as adjusted equals operating income gaap basis excluding certain items management deems nonrecurring recurring infrequently or transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value management believes operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time and therefore provide useful disclosure to investors 

 

   



 management believes operating income exclusive of these items is a useful measure in evaluating blackrock’s operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented 

 



 

 

 

 

 operating income used for measuring operating margin as adjusted is equal to operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and related commissions management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact blackrock’s results until future periods 

revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services which due to the terms of the contracts are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time substantially offset distribution fee revenue the company earns for each of these items blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue 

2 nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted 

nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted equals nonoperating income expense gaap basis less net income loss attributable to nci adjusted for compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans the compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income this compensation expense has been 

included in nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans which are reported in nonoperating income expense gaap basis 

management believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides comparability of information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock’s nonoperating contribution to results as compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans which is included in operating income substantially offsets the gain loss on the investments set aside for these plans management believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides a useful measure for both management and investors of blackrock’s nonoperating results that impact book value during 2013 the noncash nonoperating pretax gain of 80 million related to the contributed pennymac investment has been excluded from nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature and because the more than offsetting associated charitable contribution expense of 124 million is reported in operating income 

 

 

 

 

3 net income attributable to blackrock as adjusted 

management believes net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted and diluted earnings per common share as adjusted are useful measures of blackrock’s profitability and financial performance net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted equals net income attributable to blackrock inc gaap basis adjusted for significant nonrecurring items charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow 

 

 see aforementioned discussion regarding operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted for information on the pnc ltip funding obligation charitable contribution uk lease exit costs and contribution to stifs 

 

 

for each period presented the nongaap adjustments including the pnc ltip funding obligation uk lease exit costs and contribution to stifs were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments amounts for 2013 included a tax benefit of approximately 48 million recognized in connection with the charitable contribution the tax benefit has been excluded from net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted due to the nonrecurring nature of the charitable contribution 

nongaap adjustments for 2014 2013 and 2012 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities related to intangible assets andor goodwill the amount for 2014 included a 9 million net noncash tax benefit arising primarily from state and local income tax changes the amount for 2013 included a 69 million noncash tax benefit primarily related to legislation enacted in the united kingdom and state and local income tax changes the amount for 2012 included a 50 million noncash tax benefit primarily related to the effect of legislation enacted in the united kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the company’s organizational structure such amounts for 2014 2013 and 2012 have been excluded from as adjusted results as they will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented

discussion of financial results 

introduction 

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation 

and net inflows or outflows net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets additional fundings from existing clients including dividend reinvestment withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on and changes in the fair value of securities held in client accounts foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of converting nonus dollar denominated aum into us dollars for reporting purposes 

blackrock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and brokerdealers the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities generally the revenue earned is shared between blackrock and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed historically securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand 

investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative andor absolute investment performance in addition to base fees based on aum investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold as such the 

 

 

 

timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of blackrock’s revenue and earnings the magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products however the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either september 30 or december 31 

blackrock provides a variety of risk management investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions pension funds asset managers foundations consultants mutual fund sponsors real estate investment trusts and government agencies these services are provided under the brand name blackrock solutions and include a wide array of risk management services valuation services related to illiquid securities disposition and workout assignments including longterm portfolio liquidation assignments strategic planning and execution and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients the company’s aladdin ® operating platform serves as the investmentrisk solutions system for blackrock and other institutional investors fees earned for blackrock solutions and advisory services are determined using some or all of the following methods i percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform ii fixed fees and iii performance fees if contractual thresholds are met

the company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments 

operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits distribution and servicing costs amortization of deferred sales commissions direct fund expense general and administration expense and amortization of finitelived intangible assets 

 



  

  

 approximately 75 of the company’s revenue is generated in us dollars the company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies primarily the euro and british pound are impacted by foreign exchange rates any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the company’s considerable nondollar expense base related to its operations outside the united states

on behalf of certain clients the company lends securities to highly rated banks and brokerdealers in these securities lending transactions the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral blackrock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential losses resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligations under the securities lending agreement at december 31 2014 the company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately 1457 billion the company held as agent cash and securities totaling 1558 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31 2014 the fair value of these indemnifications was not material at december 31 2014 

while the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement in the event of a borrower default the company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations if the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the company has provided indemnification blackrock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall these indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above and do not in any way guarantee assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k 

 

 

 

consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products the accounting method used by the company to record its investments depends upon the influence the company has over the given investee the sponsored investment funds and securitization products collectively “investment products” to the extent that blackrock has a controlling financial interest in the investment product which generally exists if there is a 50 or greater voting interest or if partners or members of the investment products do not have substantive rights blackrock consolidates the investment product 

for certain investment products in which a controlling financial interest is not directly linked to voting interests an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a vie or a voting rights entity 

consolidation of variable interest entities  certain investment products for which a controlling financial interest is not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed vies blackrock reviews factors including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns to determine if the investment product is a vie blackrock continuously evaluates such factors as facts and circumstances change to determine if the initial vie status determination must be reconsidered blackrock is required to consolidate a vie when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary “pb” significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the company is the pb of a vie if the company is determined to be the pb of a vie blackrock will consolidate the entity in order to determine whether the company is the pb of a vie management must make significant estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows 

assumptions made in such analyses may include but are not limited to market prices of securities market interest rates potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities prepayments realization of gains liquidity or marketability of certain securities discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes 

in the normal course of business the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles including collateralized debt obligations “cdos” or clos and sponsored investment funds which may be considered vies at december 31 2014 the company’s consolidated vies consisted primarily of clos 

clos at december 31 2014 blackrock was the manager of over 20 closcdos and other securitization entities blackrock was determined to be the pb for certain of these clos which required blackrock to consolidate these vies blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities of the clos that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie at december 31 2014 the company had 3615 million and 3634 million in assets and liabilities respectively on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated clos the company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities of the clos recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition as the clo noteholders ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the clos’ assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of these clos have no impact on net income 

attributable to blackrock or its cash flows excluding outstanding management fee receivables the company has no risk of loss related to its involvement with these vies 

consolidation of voting rights entities  to the extent that blackrock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which generally exists if there is a 50 or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights blackrock consolidates the investee 

the company as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies pursuant to accounting standards codification “asc” 81020 control of partnerships and similar entities “asc 81020” the company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether other nonaffiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the investment vehicle or otherwise to remove blackrock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote or have other substantive participating rights if the investment vehicle is not a vie and the presumption of control is not overcome blackrock will consolidate the investment vehicle 

see note 4 consolidated sponsored investment funds  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for amounts included on the company’s consolidated financial statements deemed to be voting rights entities 

investments 

equity method investments  for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where it is not the pb of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company follows the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity 

blackrock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value therefore under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income expense for investments in investment companies or as other revenue for certain strategic investments which are recorded in other assets since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock’s core business 

 

 

 

at december 31 2014 the company had 654 million and 208 million of equity method investments including equity method investments held for deferred compensation reflected within investments and other assets respectively and at december 31 2013 the company had 736 million and 163 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets respectively 

impairment of investments management periodically assesses equity method availableforsale heldtomaturity and cost investments for impairment if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist investments are evaluated using market values where available or the expected future cash flows of the investment if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the company’s carrying value of the investment and the impairment is considered otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income 

when the fair value of availableforsale securities is lower than cost the company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “otherthantemporary” in making this determination for equity securities the company considers among other factors the length of time the security has been in a loss position the extent to which the security’s market value is less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses if the impairment is considered otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income expense on the consolidated statement of income in making this determination for debt securities the company considers whether 1 it has the intent to sell the security 2 it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or 3 it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security if the company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered a credit loss the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 

fair value measurements 

the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for more information on fair value measurements 

level 3 inputs include the most currently available information including capital account balances for its partnership interests in various alternative investments which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices certain investments that are valued using net asset values and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are 

included in level 3 blackrock’s 528 million of level 3 investments or 27 of total gaap investments at december 31 2014 primarily included coinvestments in private equity funds of funds and private equity funds funds of hedge funds as well as alternative hedge funds that invest in distressed credit opportunistic funds and mortgage securities and real estate equity products many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund which could include blackrock employees fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricingvaluation information including independent appraisals from thirdparty sources however in some instances current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any thirdparty source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from thirdparty sources are not reliable in these instances fund management may perform modelbased analytical valuations to value these investments 

changes in valuation changes in value on 1460 million of investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense 201 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income 175 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 85 million relates to carried interest which will not impact nonoperating income expense at december 31 2014 changes in fair value of approximately 713 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact blackrock’s net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was 696 million 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary openend investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost in addition trade namestrademarks are considered indefinitelived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with the applicable provisions of asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other “asc 350” indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2014 ranged from 1 to 10 years with a weightedaverage remaining estimated useful life of 38 years 

goodwill the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment assessment performed as of july 31 2014 indicated no impairment charge was required the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2014 the company’s common 

 

 

 

stock closed at 35756 which exceeded its book value after excluding appropriated retained earnings of approximately 16406 per share 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinitelife and finitelife classifications are still appropriate in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is less than carrying value blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates in addition the company considered other factors including i macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or other developments in equity and credit markets ii industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates an increased competitive environment a decline in marketdependent multiples or metrics a change in the market for an entity’s services or regulatory legal or political developments and iii entityspecific events such as a change in management or key personnel overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs 

if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform an impairment test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion if the asset is determined to be impaired the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 157 million 161 million and 157 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

in 2014 2013 and 2012 the company performed impairment tests including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments in 2014 and 2013 the company determined that no impairment charges were required the classification of indefinitelived versus finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles were required the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and 

potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2014 blackrock had 379 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 283 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2014 the company had deferred tax assets of 10 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately 4989 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company 

company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard the assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

at december 31 2014 the company had recorded a deferred tax asset of 157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the company expects to hold certain investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized however changes in circumstance could cause the company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change such changes may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements see note 20 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for further details 

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately 117 million and current income taxes payables of 125 million at december 31 2014 

revenue recognition investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or in the case of certain real estate clients net operating income generated by the underlying properties investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows 

 

 

 

investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers 

the company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the company manages such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund in certain cases the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the company bears no credit risk to the third party the company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with asc 60545 revenue recognition — principal agent considerations “asc 60545” and records its management fees net of retrocessions retrocessions for 2014 2013 and 2012 were 891 million 785 million and 793 million respectively the company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which due to the terms of the contracts are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income 

the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and brokerdealers revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis the securities loaned are secured by collateral generally ranging from 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities generally the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed for 2014 2013 and 2012 securities lending revenue totaled 477 million 447 million and 510 million respectively and is recorded in investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee 

the company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations from certain actively managed investment funds and certain smas these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which varies by product or account and could be monthly quarterly annually or longer 

in addition the company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds blackrock may be required to return all or part of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these funds therefore blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable 

the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2014 and 2013 the company had 105 million and 108 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition the ultimate recognition of performance fee revenue if any for these products is unknown 

for the years ended 2014 2013 and 2012 performance fee revenue totaled 550 million 561 million and 463 million respectively 

fees earned for blackrock solutions  which include advisory services are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some or all of the following methods i percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform ii fixed fees and iii performance fees if contractual thresholds are met revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of onetime advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on aum of the respective portfolio assignment for 2014 2013 and 2012 blackrock solutions and advisory revenue totaled 635 million 577 million and 518 million respectively 

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable

financial highlights 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

assets under management 

a summary of the company’s aum by product type for the years 2008 through 2013 is presented below 

 

  

  

   

aum represents the broad ranges of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing for example net asset value reported aum does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice or assets that we are retained to manage on a shortterm temporary basis 

investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of aum we also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreedupon benchmark or return hurdle on some products we also may earn securities lending fees in addition blackrock offers its proprietary aladdin ® investment system as well as risk 

management outsourcing and advisory services to institutional investors under the brs name revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions number of users accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives 

at december 31 2013 total aum was 4324 trillion representing a cagr of 27 over the last five years aum growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains net new business and acquisitions including bgi which added approximately 1844 trillion of aum in december 2009 claymore and srpep which added 137 billion of aum in 2012 and credit suisse and mgpa which added 269 billion of aum in 2013 these acquisitions significantly changed our aum mix from predominantly active fixed income and equity in 2008 to a broadly diversified product range as described below 

 

 

the company considers the categorization of its aum by client type product type investment style and client region useful to understanding its business the following discussion of the company’s aum will be organized as follows 

 

  

 

client type 

we serve a diverse mix of institutional and retail investors worldwide clients include taxexempt institutions such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans charities foundations and endowments official institutions such as central banks sovereign wealth funds supranationals and other government entities taxable institutions including insurance companies financial institutions corporations and thirdparty fund sponsors and retail investors ishares is presented as a separate client type below with investments in ishares by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections below 

our organizational structure was designed to ensure that strong investment performance is our highest priority and that we best align with our clients’ needs to capitalize on broader industry trends furthermore our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent specifically the client side of our business is organized into two groups one comprising retail and ishares and another comprising institutional and blackrock solutions  the separation of the client functions into these two teams allows us to focus on the unique needs of these client groups by bringing the full capabilities of the firm to bear in an organized cohesive approach additionally our investments functions are split into five distinct strategies alpha beta multiasset alternatives and tradingliquidity 

 

 

 retail investors 

 

  

  

   

blackrock serves retail investors globally through separate accounts openend and closedend funds unit trusts and private investment funds retail investors are served principally through intermediaries including brokerdealers banks trust companies insurance companies and independent financial advisors clients invest primarily in mutual funds which totaled 4022 billion or 82 of retail longterm aum at yearend with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts “smas” the majority 94 of longterm retail aum is invested in active products although this is impacted by the fact that ishares is shown separately retail represented 12 of longterm aum at december 31 2013 and 34 of longterm base fees for 2013 

the client base is also diversified geographically with 70 of longterm aum managed for investors based in the americas 24 in emea and 6 in asiapacific at yearend 2013 

 





 

 

 

  





 

 

ishares 

 

  

  

   

ishares is the leading etf provider in the world with 9144 billion of aum at december 31 2013 and was the top asset gatherer globally in 2013 3 with 640 billion of net inflows for an organic growth rate of 8 equity net inflows of 741 billion were driven by flows into funds with broad developed market exposures partially offset by outflows from emerging markets products ishares fixed income experienced net outflows of 75 billion as the continued low interest rate environment led many liquidityoriented investors to sell longduration assets which made up the majority of the ishares fixed income suite in 2013 we launched several funds to meet demand from clients seeking protection in a rising interest rate environment by offering an expanded product set that includes four new us funds including shortduration versions of our flagship high yield and investment grade credit products and short maturity and liquidity income funds ishares alternatives had 31 billion of net outflows predominantly out of commodities ishares represented 23 of longterm aum at december 31 2013 and 35 of longterm base fees for 2013 

ishares offers the most diverse product set in the industry with 703 etfs at yearend 2013 and serves the broadest client base covering more than 25 countries on five continents during 2013 ishares continued its dual commitment to innovation and responsible product structuring by introducing 42 new etfs acquiring credit suisse’s 58 etfs in europe and entering into a critical new strategic alliance with fidelity investments to deliver fidelity’s more than 10 million clients increased access to 

ishares products tools and support our alliance with fidelity investments and a successful full first year for the core series have deeply expanded our presence and offerings among buyandhold investors our broad product range offers investors a precise transparent and lowcost way to tap market returns and gain access to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult or expensive for many investors to access until now as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and costefficiently 

 

  



 

 

 

  

  

  

 

institutional investors 

 

  

  

   

blackrock’s institutional aum is well diversified by both product and region and we serve institutional investors on six continents in subcategories including pensions endowments and foundations official institutions and financial institutions as described below 

institutional active aum ended the quarter at 9324 billion up 477 billion or 5 since yearend 2012 institutional active represented 23 of longterm aum and 21 of longterm base fees growth in aum reflected continued strength in multiasset class products with net inflows of 290 billion largely from defined contribution plans into target date offerings multiasset class net inflows were offset by equity net outflows of 165 billion with 70 of outflows coming from fundamental strategies and fixed income net outflows of 36 billion largely from us intermediate duration mandates alternatives net outflows of 98 billion were primarily due to active currency redemptions of 65 billion and return of capital on opportunistic funds of 25 billion 

institutional nonetf index aum totaled 1678 trillion at december 31 2013 reflecting net inflows of 153 billion flows were led by fixed income with net inflows of 83 billion primarily into local currency us targeted duration and global bond mandates as clients rebalanced portfolios and captured gains in equity markets equities saw net inflows of 80 billion primarily into global mandates as clients increasingly looked to use passive vehicles for broad macro exposure institutional nonetf index represented 42 of longterm aum at december 31 2013 and accounted for 10 of longterm base fees for 2013 

the company’s institutional clients consist of the following 

 



  

  



 

 

 

product type 

component changes in aum by product type and investment style for 2013 are presented below 

 

  

  

   

longterm product offerings include active and passive strategies our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile we offer two types of active strategies those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction in contrast passive strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index passive strategies include both our institutional nonetf index products and ishares etfs 

although many clients use both active and passive strategies the application of these strategies may differ for example clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class in addition institutional nonetf index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and typically reflect low fee rates this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

equity 

yearend 2013 equity aum of 2318 trillion increased by 4722 billion or 26 from the end of 2012 largely due to flows into us and a range of international equity mandates reflecting investors’ increased risk appetite and the effect of higher market valuations equity aum growth included 693 billion in net new business and 130 billion in new 

assets related to the credit suisse etf acquisition in july 2013 net new business of 693 billion was driven by net inflows of 741 billion and 105 billion into ishares and nonetf index accounts respectively passive inflows were offset by active net outflows of 154 billion with net outflows of 99 billion and 55 billion from fundamental and scientific active equity products respectively 

blackrock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix approximately half of blackrock’s equity aum is tied to international markets including emerging markets which tend to have higher fee rates than similar us equity strategies accordingly fluctuations in international equity markets which do not consistently move in tandem with us markets may have a greater impact on blackrock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues 

fixed income 

fixed income aum ended 2013 at 1242 trillion declining 171 billion or 1 relative to december 31 2012 the decline in aum reflected 291 billion in market and foreign exchange losses partially offset by 115 billion in net new business and 13 billion in new assets related to the credit suisse etf acquisition in 2013 net new business was led by strong flows into unconstrained fixed income offerings such as our strategic income opportunities fund which had net inflows of 69 billion during the year despite overall industry outflows from us bond funds fixed income net inflows of 148 billion and 85 billion into fundamental and nonetf index products respectively were partially offset by net outflows of 75 billion and 43 billion from ishares and model based strategies respectively

securities lending 

securities lending is managed by a dedicated team supported by quantitative analysis proprietary technology and disciplined risk management the cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings andor as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral the value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the corresponding asset class being managed the value of the collateral is not included in aum 

outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately 156 billion up from 134 billion at yearend 2012 liability spreads declined from elevated 2012 levels as the proportion of “special collateral” securities commanding premium lending fees declined due to low idiosyncratic risk low single stock volatility and lack of ma activity 

blackrock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality liquidity and interest rate risk management disciplined risk management including a rigorous credit surveillance process is an integral part of the investment process blackrock’s cash management credit committee has established risk limits such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits across many of the products blackrock manages including over all of its cash management products in the ordinary course of our business there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed no such instances individually or in the aggregate have been material to the company to the extent that daily evaluationreporting of the profile of the portfolios identifies that a limit has been exceeded the relevant portfolio will be adjusted to the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers while a risk limit may be waived such temporary waivers are infrequent 

risk  quantitative analysis 

across all asset classes in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams the risk  quantitative analysis “rqa” group at blackrock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and thirdparty data to identify measure and manage a wide range of risks rqa provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk managementrelated analytical and information requirements where appropriate rqa will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics 

competition 

blackrock competes with investment management firms mutual fund complexes insurance companies banks brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to or alternatives to those offered by blackrock in order to grow its business blackrock must 

be able to compete effectively for aum key competitive factors include investment performance track records the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products investment style and discipline client service and brand name recognition historically the company has competed principally on the basis of its longterm investment performance track record its investment process its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service these factors may place blackrock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing aum and to attract new business will be successful

regulation 

virtually all aspects of blackrock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations both in and outside the united 

 

 

 

states some of which are summarized below these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients investors in registered and unregistered investment companies trust customers of blackrock institutional trust company na “btc” pnc and its bank subsidiaries and their customers and the financial system under these laws and regulations agencies that regulate investment advisers investment funds and bank holding companies and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers including the power to limit restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time revocation of investment adviser and other registrations censures and fines both for individuals and the company the rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical accordingly the discussion below is general in nature does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report 

regulatory reform 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “dfa” was signed into law in the united states the dfa is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be fully implemented the continued adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the dfa on blackrock and other financial services firms the dfa may significantly change blackrock’s operating environment and the financial markets in general in unpredictable ways it is not possible to predict the ultimate effects that the dfa or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions will have upon blackrock’s business financial condition and results of operations among the potential impacts provisions of the dfa referred to as the volcker rule will affect the extent to which blackrock invests in and transacts with certain of its investment funds including private equity funds hedge funds and funds of funds the impact of the volcker rule on liquidity and pricing in the broader financial markets is unknown at this time for a further discussion of the volcker rule see “item 1a — risk factors — legal and regulatory risks” in addition blackrock could be designated a systemically important financial institution “sifi” and become subject to direct supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” if blackrock were designated a sifi it could be subject to enhanced prudential supervisory and other requirements such as riskbased capital requirements leverage limits liquidity requirements resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements concentration limits a contingent capital requirement enhanced public disclosures shortterm debt limits and overall risk management requirements further new regulations under the dfa relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives will impact the manner by which blackrockadvised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives and may significantly increase the costs of derivatives trading similarly blackrock’s management of funds and accounts that use and trade swaps and derivatives could be adversely impacted by recently adopted changes to the commodity futures trading commission’s the “cftc” regulations these rule changes 

include those concerning among other things the registration and regulation of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors and the accompanying registration and regulation of such entities by the national futures association the “nfa” the registration status of dealer counterparties and other counterparties who are major participants in the swap markets and requirements concerning mandatory clearing of certain swap transactions jurisdictions outside the united states in which blackrock operates are also in the process of devising or considering more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could have a similar impact on blackrock and the broader markets 

the dfa and its regulations and other new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities require blackrock to change certain business practices divert management’s time and attention from blackrock’s business activities to compliance activities and expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and tax costs and liabilities as well as reputational harm for example in addition to regulatory changes mandated by the dfa the securities and exchange commission the “sec” continues to review the role of and risks related to money market funds and has indicated that it may adopt additional regulations some of the proposed changes if adopted could significantly alter money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry in 2012 the office of the comptroller of the currency of the united states the “occ” amended the regulations governing bankmaintained shortterm investment funds “stifs” to include new disclosure requirements regarding portfolio holdings and to more closely align portfolio limitations such as maximum weighted average maturity and weighted average life with those applicable to sec registered money market funds similarly the sec continues to review the distribution fees paid to mutual fund distributors under rule 12b1 under the investment company act of 1940 the “investment company act” which are important to a number of the mutual funds blackrock manages any changes to 12b1 fees would alter the way blackrock’s distribution partners distribute blackrock products additionally the sec the internal revenue service “irs” and the cftc each continue to review the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds and such reviews could result in regulations that further limit the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds if adopted these limitations could require blackrock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the cftc which could result in additional costs andor restrictions in addition blackrock has begun reporting certain information about a number of its private funds to the sec and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the cftc pursuant to systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies which have required and will continue to require investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting still another example of changes in the regulatory landscape was the irs’ implementation of foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” fatca was enacted in 2010 and is intended to address tax compliance issues associated with us taxpayers with foreign accounts fatca requires foreign financial institutions to report to the irs information about financial accounts held by us taxpayers and imposes withholding documentation and reporting requirements on foreign financial institutions final 

 

 

 

regulations were issued by the irs on january 17 2013 with the earliest effective dates beginning on july 1 2014 in many instances however the precise nature of what needs to be implemented will be governed by bilateral intergovernmental agreements “igas” between the united states and the countries in which blackrock does business while many of these igas have been put into place others have yet to be concluded fatca could cause the company to incur significant administrative and compliance costs and subject clients to us tax withholding 

an example of changes in the regulatory landscape in europe is the european union “eu” alternative investment fund managers directive “aifmd” which became effective on july 21 2011 and was required to be implemented by eu member states by july 22 2013 the aifmd regulates managers of and service providers to a broad range of alternative investment funds “aifs” domiciled within and depending on the precise circumstances outside the eu the aifmd also regulates the marketing of all aifs inside the european economic area the “eea” in general the aifmd will have a staged implementation between mid2013 and 2018 compliance with the aifmd’s requirements will restrict aif marketing and will place additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration capital requirements leverage valuation stakes in eu companies depositaries the domicile of custodians and liquidity management 

globally regulators are examining the potential risks in etfs and may impose additional regulations on etfs including requirements to promote increased transparency and to limit the ability of etfs to utilize derivatives the international organization of securities commissions published principles for regulatory oversight of financial benchmarks in 2013 with standards applying to methodologies for benchmark calculation and transparency and governance issues in the benchmarking process some national and regional regulators are currently reviewing how to apply these principles with a draft european regulation published in september 2013 any of these regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions could materially and adversely impact the value of assets in which blackrock has invested directly andor on behalf of clients and to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms could make it more difficult for blackrock to conduct certain businesses or distinguish itself from competitors 

additional legislation changes in rules promulgated by regulators and selfregulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of blackrock blackrock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce see the “— nonus regulation” section below for a further discussion of regulatory reforms being considered andor adopted outside of the united states 

us regulation 

blackrock and certain of its us subsidiaries are subject to regulation primarily at the federal level by the sec the department of labor the “dol” the federal reserve the occ the financial industry regulatory authority “finra”

blackrock manages a variety of private pools of capital including hedge funds funds of hedge funds private equity funds cdos real estate funds collective investment trusts managed futures funds and hybrid funds congress regulators tax authorities and others continue to explore on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public increased regulation related to private pools of capital including changes with respect to investor eligibility certain limitations on trading activities recordkeeping and reporting the scope of antifraud protections safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters blackrock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation rulemaking or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators 

certain blackrock subsidiaries are subject to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the dol insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under erisa with respect to benefit plan clients erisa and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code impose certain duties on persons who are 

 

 

 

fiduciaries under erisa prohibit certain transactions involving erisa plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require blackrock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty erisa also imposes additional compliance reporting and operational requirements on blackrock that otherwise are not applicable to nonbenefit plan clients 

blackrock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators “cpos” andor commodity trading advisors with the cftc and are members of the nfa additional blackrock entities may need to register as a cpo or commodity trading advisor as a result of recently enacted regulatory changes by the cftc the cftc and nfa each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments including swaps as a result of the dfa in which certain blackrock clients may invest two of blackrock’s other subsidiaries blackrock investments llc “bril” and blackrock execution services are registered with the sec as brokerdealers and are memberfirms of finra each brokerdealer has a membership agreement with finra that limits the scope of such brokerdealer’s permitted activities bril is also an approved person with the new york stock exchange “nyse” and a member of the municipal securities rulemaking board “msrb” subject to msrb rules 

us banking regulation 

pnc is a bank holding company and regulated as a “financial holding company” by the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of 1956 the “bhc act” as described in “item 1business” pnc owns approximately 22 of blackrock’s capital stock based on the federal reserve’s current interpretation of the bhc act this ownership interest causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for purposes of the bhc act and therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve and to most banking laws regulations and orders that apply to pnc including the volcker rule the supervision and regulation of pnc and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries its depositors the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation and the financial system as a whole rather than for the protection of stockholders creditors or clients of pnc or blackrock pnc’s relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of blackrock’s business blackrock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business 

btc is a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and is a member of the federal reserve system accordingly btc is examined and supervised by the occ and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the occ such as capital adequacy regulations governing fiduciaries conflicts of interest selfdealing and antimoney laundering laws and regulations btc is also subject to various federal reserve regulations applicable to member institutions such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of btc’s customers and not btc blackrock and its affiliates or blackrock’s stockholders 

blackrock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company under the bhc act investment management is an authorized activity but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements which in some cases are more restrictive than those blackrock faces under applicable securities laws blackrock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory administrative or other services only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations the federal reserve has broad powers to approve deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for blackrock to conduct new activities acquire or divest businesses or assets or reconfigure existing operations there are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of pnc to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with blackrock or its funds pnc and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of blackrock’s businesses 

the federal reserve has broad enforcement authority over blackrock including the power to prohibit blackrock from conducting any activity that in the federal reserve’s opinion is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting blackrock’s business the federal reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws regulations and orders the dfa strengthened the federal reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s nonbank affiliates such as blackrock 

any failure of pnc to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain blackrock activities and its growth such a change of status could be caused by any failure of pnc or one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” by any examination downgrade of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries or by any failure of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 

nonus regulation 

blackrock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies and bodies and in certain cases are affected by us laws and regulations that have extraterritorial application as blackrock continues to expand its international presence a number of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory frameworks comparable to those affecting its operations in the united states 

the financial conduct authority the “fca” currently regulates certain blackrock subsidiaries in the united kingdom and branches of its uk regulated entities in the eu and the prudential regulation authority the “pra” also regulates one blackrock subsidiary in the united kingdom authorization by the fca andor the pra is required to conduct any financial services related business in the united kingdom under the financial services and markets act 2000 the fca’s rules made under that act govern a firm’s capital resources requirements senior management arrangements 

 

 

 

conduct of business interaction with clients and systems and controls whereas the rules of the pra focus solely on the prudential requirements imposed on firms the fca supervises the company’s ukregulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement eventdriven and reactive supervision and thematic based reviews — in order to monitor the company’s compliance with regulatory requirements breaches of the fca’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the company’s ukregulated subsidiaries andor its employees 

in addition to the above the company’s ukregulated subsidiaries and other european subsidiaries and branches must comply with the paneuropean regulatory regime established by the markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” which became effective on november 1 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the eea as well as the capital requirements directive which delineates regulatory capital requirements revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms apply as of january 1 2014 these include requirements not only on capital but address matters of governance and remuneration as well these will have a direct effect on some of blackrock’s european operations mifid sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets it also includes pre and posttrade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements 

the united kingdom has adopted the mifid rules into national legislation and fca regulations as have those other european jurisdictions in which blackrock has a presence excluding switzerland which is not part of the eu or eea a review of mifid by the european commission has led to the publication of a draft amended directive and a draft new markets in financial instruments regulation the proposals which are currently being finalized are likely to result in changes to pre and posttrade reporting obligations and an expansion of the types of instruments subject to these requirements they may affect the buying and selling of derivatives by moving most derivative trading onto regulated trading venues and may control the activities of algorithmic trading the proposals may also result in changes to conduct of business requirements including selling practices intermediary inducements and client categorization the proposals also envisage giving the european commission power to ban certain products and services a further eu regulation regulation eu no 6482012 of the european parliament and of the council of july 4 2012 on otc derivatives central counterparties and trade repositories was adopted in august 2012 and requires i the central clearing of standardized otc derivatives ii the application of riskmitigation techniques to noncentrally cleared otc derivatives and iii the reporting of all derivative contracts from february 2014 

in addition the fca will introduce rules in april 2014 that ban payments by product providers to distribution platforms for both advised and nonadvised business these rules follow on from the retail distribution review that came into effect in december 2012 and changed how retail clients pay for investment advice the fca also has proposed a prohibition on the use of dealing commissions to pay for corporate access final rules are expected to be issued in mid2014 along with a discussion paper on the broader use of dealing commissions 

in the aftermath of the financial crisis the european commission set out a detailed plan for eu financial reform outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives regulations and recommendations of which the mifid review mentioned above was a part these together with the changes contemplated by the aifmd mentioned above will have direct and indirect effects on blackrock’s operations in the eea 

the european commission has also published proposals to replace the market abuse directive with a regulation on insider dealing and market manipulation and with an accompanying directive on criminal sanctions the regulation has now been largely agreed but an implementation date remains outstanding as it will be linked to the commencement of the revised mifid rules 

the next iteration of the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directive “ucits iv” was required to be adopted in the national law of each eu member state by july 1 2011 the united kingdom has adopted ucits iv requirements into national legislation and fca regulation luxembourg and ireland have also adopted ucits iv into their national legislation however several other eu member states are still in various stages of the adoption process ucits iv introduced new requirements including a requirement on ucits funds to provide a key investor information document recent european commission consultations have addressed retail investor protection issues including ucits v which considers among other items custodial liability and ucits vi which includes proposals on depositaries and product management a separate proposed regulation on money market funds has also been published and would if adopted have a significant impact on blackrock’s european money market fund offerings 

proposals on packaged retail investment products “prips” are to be implemented through the strengthening of mifid standards for noninsurance prips revisions to the insurance mediation directive’s selling standard for all insurancebased prips and new investor disclosure requirements for all prips though a separate eu legislative process 

the european securities and markets authority “esma” has published guidelines on etfs and other ucits issues in february 2013 which introduce new collateral management requirements for ucits concerning collateral received in the context of derivatives using efficient portfolio management techniques and otc derivative transactions these rules will require significant changes and implementation is due by february 2014 

certain individual eu member states such as france and italy have enacted national financial transaction taxes “ftts” and a group of member states also could adopt a ftt under an eu enhanced cooperation procedure that would apply in those member states in general any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that we manage in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products a ftt could significantly increase the operational costs of our entering into on behalf of our clients securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to a ftt which would adversely impact our revenues 

for the insurance sector the solvency ii process will increase the amount of capital that insurers will have to set 

 

 

 

aside and will have an indirect effect on fund managers with insurance clients the solvency ii process has been delayed from an original compliance date of january 1 2014 but agreement has now been confirmed for implementation on january 1 2016 

in addition to the fca the activities of certain blackrock subsidiaries branches and representative offices are overseen by financial services regulators in germany the netherlands ireland luxembourg switzerland isle of man jersey france belgium italy poland south africa spain and sweden regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including among other things the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations in addition these regulators may subject certain blackrock subsidiaries to net capital requirements other blackrock subsidiaries branches and representative offices are regulated in japan australia china hong kong singapore taiwan south korea india dubai cayman islands brazil chile mexico and canada 

in japan a blackrock subsidiary is subject to the financial instruments and exchange law the “fiel” and the law concerning investment trusts and investment corporations these laws are administered and enforced by the japanese financial services agency the “jfsa” which establishes standards for compliance including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules the jfsa is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure fine the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the fiel 

in australia blackrock’s subsidiaries are subject to various australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the australian securities and investments commission “asic” asic regulates companies and financial services in australia and is responsible for promoting investor creditor and consumer protection failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in australia

 item 1a risk factors 

as a leading investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks while blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify measure monitor manage and analyze market operating and compliance risks blackrock’s business financial condition operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties including the ones discussed below 

market and external risks 

changes in the value levels of the capital commodities or currency markets or other asset classes could adversely impact revenues and earnings 

blackrock’s investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management “aum” and in some cases performance fees normally expressed as a percentage of the returns in excess of a benchmark numerous factors including movements in equity debt commodity real estate and alternative investment asset prices interest rates or foreign exchange rates could cause 

 

  

  



 

 

 

  

  

 the occurrence of any of these events could result in lower investment advisory management administration and performance fees and cause the company’s revenues and earnings to decline 

competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins 

the investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry to the extent that blackrock is forced to compete on the basis of price fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline 

failure of other financial institutions could adversely affect blackrock’s earnings 

the products and accounts that blackrock manages have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and blackrock routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks clearing organizations mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose blackrock’s products and accounts to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty while blackrock regularly assesses risks posed by these counterparties such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform such a failure could negatively impact the performance of blackrock’s products and accounts which could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

the failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to reduced aum in similar products of blackrock without regard to the performance of blackrock’s products 

the failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products of blackrock without regard to the performance of blackrock’s products such a negative perception could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on the company’s aum revenues and earnings 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

separate account and commingled trust clients may terminate their investment management contracts with blackrock or withdraw funds on short notice the company experiences routine turnover in commingled trust funds and separate accounts and could in the future lose significant aum in funds and accounts due to various circumstances such as adverse market conditions fee competition or poor performance 

additionally blackrock manages its us mutual funds closedend and exchangetraded funds under management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds’ boards of directors annually and may be terminated by them without cause on short notice certain additional services such as securities lending also require approval by the funds’ boards of directors annually a majority of the directors of each such fund are independent from blackrock consequently there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund managed by the company will not terminate blackrock or will approve the fund’s management contract each year or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the company 

further the governing agreements of many of the company’s private investment funds generally provide that subject to certain conditions investors in those funds and in some cases independent directors of those funds may remove blackrock as the investment adviser general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote resulting in a reduction in the management or performance fees as well as the total carried interest blackrock could earn 

operating in international markets increases blackrock’s operational regulatory and other risks 

as a result of blackrock’s extensive international business activities the company faces associated operational regulatory reputational and foreign exchange rate risks the failure of the company’s systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could cause the company’s earnings to decline 

risks related to blackrock’s business and internal operations 

poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues and earnings 

the company’s management believes that investment performance including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of aum poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could reduce revenues and cause earnings to decline as a result of 

 

  

  

  

 performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings 

a portion of blackrock’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments performance fees represented 

 

 

 

561 million or 6 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods 

changes in the value of seed and coinvestments that blackrock owns could affect blackrock’s nonoperating income or earnings and could increase the volatility of its earnings 

at december 31 2013 blackrock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately 16 billion in its investments see “item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsinvestments” primarily resulted from coinvestments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds a decline in the prices of equity or debt securities or the value of real estate or other alternative investments could lower the value of these investments increase the volatility of blackrock’s earnings and if such prices decline or blackrock realizes losses could result in a decline in earnings 

additionally the company may generate realized and unrealized capital losses on such seed investments and coinvestments us federal realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes the company has unrealized capital losses for which a deferred tax asset has been established in the event such unrealized losses are realized the company may not be able to offset such losses within the carryback or carryforward period or from future realized capital gains in which case the deferred tax asset will not be realized the failure to utilize the deferred tax asset could materially increase blackrock’s income tax expense 

failure to maintain adequate infrastructure and a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the company’s infrastructure including its technological capacity data centers and office space is vital to the competitiveness of its business the failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business including any expansion or the outage or failure of existing infrastructure could materially impact operations and impede the company’s productivity and growth which could cause the company’s earnings to decline or could impact the company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to regulatory fines and sanctions 

a key element to blackrock’s continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into blackrock’s aladdin technology platform that support investment advisory and brs clients moreover the company’s technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data and software the failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties 

and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and brs clients there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes 

failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in blackrock’s earnings 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information and cyber security policies procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a hacker attack virus or worm or an internally caused issue such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information and could result in material financial loss loss of competitive position regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause a decline in the company’s earnings 

failure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on blackrock and its products 

a significant portion of blackrock’s critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas including san francisco california new york new york and london england a major earthquake hurricane fire terrorist act or other catastrophic event in any of these locations could result in disruption to the business the failure of the company to maintain updated adequate business continuity plans including secure backup facilities systems and personnel could impede the company’s ability to operate during or could effect a disruption which could cause the company’s earnings to decline 

failure to maintain adequate liquidity for general business operations could adversely impact blackrock’s financial condition and growth prospects 

blackrock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors including its ability to maintain and grow aum its creditworthiness and operating cash flows failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force blackrock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives blackrock’s access to capital markets and its ability to issue public or private debt on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions a reduction in its long or shortterm credit ratings as well as changes in government regulations including tax and interest rates failure to obtain funds andor financing could adversely impact blackrock’s financial condition and prospects for growth 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against blackrock and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

when clients retain blackrock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf they typically specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the company is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure 

 

 

 

to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to blackrock’s reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts any of which could cause the company’s aum revenues and earnings to decline 

failure to identify errors in the quantitative models blackrock utilizes to manage its business could adversely impact product performance and client relationships 

blackrock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions and allocations including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on blackrock’s business and reputation 

the determination to provide support to particular products from time to time may reduce earnings or other investments in the business 

blackrock may at its option from time to time support investment products through capital or credit support or indemnifications such support and indemnifications utilize capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes losses or prohibitions on such support and indemnifications or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products could have an adverse impact on revenues and earnings 

failure to manage risks in operating blackrock’s securities lending program for clients could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues and liquidity 

on behalf of certain clients blackrock lends securities to banks and brokerdealers in these securities lending transactions the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral blackrock must manage risks associated with i ensuring that the value of the collateral held against the securities on loan does not decline in value or become illiquid and that its nature and value complies with regulatory requirements and investment requirements ii the potential that a borrower defaults or does not return a loaned security on a timely basis and iii errors in the settlement of securities daily marktomarket valuations and collateral collection the failure of the company’s controls to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for the company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs as well as for the company 

the determination to provide securities lending indemnifications may reduce earnings or other investments in the business 

blackrock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of a potential default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligations under the securities lending agreement these indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall and do not guarantee assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested the amount of securities on loan as of december 31 2013 and subject to 

indemnification was 1183 billion blackrock held as agent cash and securities totaling 1246 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31 2013 blackrock expects indemnified balances to continue to increase over time the failure of the company to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for the company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs as well as for the company 

failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies or fraud or the circumvention of controls and policies could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation and financial position 

although blackrock has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risks it cannot assure that such controls procedures policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to its businesses blackrock is subject to the risk that its employees contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with the company’s controls policies and procedures persistent or repeated attempts involving fraud conflicts of interests or circumvention of policies and controls could have a materially adverse impact on blackrock’s reputation and could lead to costly regulatory inquiries 

additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position if not successful 

blackrock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins these strategies have included hiring smallersized investment teams acquisitions of investment management businesses such as mgpa and credit suisse’s etf franchise and other small and mediumsized strategic acquisitions to expand geographical reach access new clients or pursue other business and financial opportunities these strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm certain aspects of the company’s competitive position in the investment management industry these strategic transactions also involve a number of financial accounting tax regulatory and operational challenges and uncertainties including the assumption of preexisting liabilities and failure to identify and mitigate associated risks through due diligence and indemnification provisions could adversely impact blackrock’s earnings and reputation in the event blackrock pursues additional acquisitions it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from such acquisitions 

the development of new products and services may expose blackrock to additional costs or operational risk  

blackrock’s financial performance depends in part on its ability to develop market and manage new investment products and services the development and introduction of new products and services may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the 

 

 

 

introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements failure to successfully manage these risks may cause blackrock’s revenues and costs to fluctuate and could have an adverse impact on its business and reputation 

loss of employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

the ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to blackrock’s growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients the market for qualified fund managers investment analysts financial advisers and other professionals is competitive there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel loss of personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

risks related to key relationships 

the failure of a key vendor to blackrock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on blackrock and its products 

blackrock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration accounting custody risk analytics market data market indices and transfer agent roles and other operational needs the failure or inability of blackrock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational and regulatory issues for the company and in certain of its products which could result in reputational harm and financial losses for the company 

bank of americamerrill lynch is an important distributor of blackrock’s products and the company is therefore subject to risks associated with the business of bank of americamerrill lynch 

under a global distribution agreement entered into with merrill lynch in 2006 merrill lynch which merged with bank of america on january 1 2009 provides distribution portfolio administration and servicing for certain blackrock investment management products and services through its various distribution channels the company may not be successful in distributing products through merrill lynch or in distributing its products and services through other thirdparty distributors if blackrock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distributionrelated costs blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

loss of market share within merrill lynch’s global wealth  investment management business could harm operating results 

a significant portion of blackrock’s revenue has historically come from aum generated by merrill lynch’s global wealth  investment management “gwim” business blackrock’s ability to maintain a strong relationship within gwim is material to the company’s future performance if one of the company’s competitors gains significant additional market share within the gwim retail channel at the expense of blackrock then blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted 

pnc has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of pnc 

as discussed in our proxy statement pnc has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement with blackrock as a consequence if the shares held by pnc constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval including elections of directors will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determination of the blackrock board of directors this arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over blackrock in its board of directors whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the board at december 31 2013 pnc owned approximately 209 of blackrock’s voting common stock 

as discussed in our proxy statement pursuant to our stockholder agreement with pnc the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors or at least twothirds of the directors then in office 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  



 

 

 

additionally blackrock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of pnc 

 

  

  

  

  

 pnc owns a large portion of blackrock’s capital stock future sales of our common stock in the public market by the company or pnc could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

as of december 31 2013 pnc owned 219 of the company’s capital stock the company has entered into a registration rights agreement with pnc the registration rights agreement provides pnc with the right to cause us to file one or more registration statements for the resale of its shares of capital stock and cooperate in certain underwritten offerings sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market pursuant to registration rights or otherwise or the perception that these sales might occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

legal and regulatory risks 

blackrock is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and internationally 

blackrock’s business is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and around the world see the discussion under “item 1 – business – regulation” new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations in the united states or internationally could adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines temporary or permanent prohibition of the engagement in certain activities reputational harm and related client terminations 

suspensions of personnel or revocation of their licenses or bank charter suspension or termination of investment adviser brokerdealer or other registrations or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation business results of operations or financial condition and cause the company’s earnings to decline 

blackrock may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other us regulatory reform initiatives 

as previously mentioned in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “dfa” was signed into law the dfa is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be implemented the adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the dfa on blackrock blackrock is continuing to review what impact the legislation and related rulemaking will have on its business financial condition and results of operations 

the dfa charges the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” should blackrock be designated a systemically important financial institution a “sifi” it could be subject to these enhanced prudential capital supervisory and other requirements which individually or in the aggregate could adversely impact blackrock’s business and operations 

the dfa and its regulations could adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities could require blackrock to change certain business practices and could expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and tax costs 

provisions of the dfa referred to as the “volcker rule” created a new section of the bhc act that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds including hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds collectively “covered funds” final regulations implementing the volcker rule were issued on december 10 2013 entities subject to the volcker rule must conform their activities to the requirements of the final implementing regulations no later than july 21 2015 subject to the granting of extensions that are available in limited circumstances because blackrock is treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc under the federal reserve’s current interpretation of the bhc act blackrock will be required to comply with the volcker rule the volcker rule will limit blackrock’s ability to invest in covered funds require blackrock to remove its name from the name of its covered funds and limit investments in covered funds by blackrock employees among other restrictions depending on the availability of statutory extensions blackrock could be required to sell certain seed and coinvestments that it holds including at a discount depending on market conditions these limitations and restrictions could disadvantage blackrock against competitors that are not subject to the volcker rule in our ability to attract clients into blackrock covered funds and to retain employees finally the restrictions on proprietary 

 

 

 

trading in the volcker rule could impact the ability of our trading counterparties to make markets and provide liquidity in certain securities which could have a negative impact on our ability to manage funds and client accounts that transact in those securities 

further the full implementation of regulations under the dfa relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner by which blackrockadvised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives and could significantly increase the costs of derivatives trading conducted by blackrock on behalf of its clients blackrock will also need to build new compliance mechanisms to monitor compliance with sec and commodity futures trading commission “cftc” rules concerning among other things the registration and regulation of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors and the accompanying registration and regulation of such entities by the national futures association the applicability of cftc rules and regulations to offshore funds accounts and counterparties and requirements to centrally clear certain swap transactions and to execute certain swap transaction only on or through cftcregistered trading venues blackrock on behalf of its clients is also preparing for the implementation of trade reporting documentation and mandated central clearing of swaps requirements in the eu and other jurisdictions globally inconsistencies and potential contradictions in the rules adopted by various global regulators will increase the operational and legal risks associated with trading in derivatives 

in addition blackrock has begun reporting certain information about a number of its private funds to the sec and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the cftc pursuant to systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies which have required and will continue to require investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting 

the sec the internal revenue service and the cftc each continue to review the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds which could result in regulations that further limit the use of such instruments by mutual funds if adopted these limitations could require blackrock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the cftc which could result in additional costs andor restrictions 

the sec has recently promulgated new rules that give effect to a section of the dfa that requires municipal advisors as that term is defined in the statute to register with the sec the new rules require entities that provide certain types of advice to or on behalf of or solicit municipal entities or certain other persons to register with the sec and the municipal securities rulemaking board “msrb” as municipal advisors thereby subjecting those entities to new or additional regulation by the sec and msrb blackrock is reviewing what impact the new rules will have on its business financial condition and results of operation 

the foregoing regulatory changes and other reforms globally could also lead to business disruptions could adversely impact the value of assets in which blackrock has invested on behalf of clients andor via seed or coinvestments and to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms could make it more difficult for blackrock to conduct certain business activities or distinguish itself from competitors see “item 1 

– business” above for additional information regarding certain laws and regulations that affect blackrock’s business 

blackrock may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes related to money market mutual funds 

regulatory authorities including the sec the fsoc and the international organization of securities commissions continue to focus on the need for additional regulations for money market mutual funds in june 2013 the sec issued for public comment a proposal to reform the regulatory structure governing money market funds and address the perceived systemic risks that money market funds present the sec’s proposal also proposes many other changes to disclosure and portfolio construction requirements for money market funds if adopted by the sec these reform proposals could significantly affect money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry in light of the uncertainty regarding what changes may ultimately be adopted in a final sec rule the company cannot predict what investor appetite will be for money market mutual fund products following the adoption of any such reforms or the impact of such reforms on blackrock 

failure to comply with the investment advisers act of 1940 the “advisers act” or the investment company act of 1940 the “investment company act” and related regulations could result in substantial harm to blackrock’s reputation and results of operations 

certain blackrock subsidiaries are registered with the sec under the advisers act and blackrock’s us mutual funds closedend funds and exchangetraded funds are registered with the sec under the investment company act the advisers act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers including recordkeeping operating and marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on selfdealing the investment company act imposes similar obligations as well as additional detailed operational and compliance requirements on investment advisers to registered investment companies the failure of any of blackrock’s relevant subsidiaries to comply with the advisers act or the investment company act could cause the sec to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts including censure termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to secregistered funds and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the company’s reputation any of which could cause its earnings to decline 

failure to comply with erisa regulations could result in penalties and cause the company’s earnings to decline 

certain blackrock subsidiaries are subject to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” and to regulations promulgated thereunder insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under erisa with respect to benefit plan clients erisa and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa prohibit specified transactions involving erisa plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions the failure of any of blackrock’s relevant subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce the company’s earnings to decline 

 

 

 

blackrock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities 

as described in “item 1business” pnc owns approximately 22 of blackrock’s capital stock based on the federal reserve’s current interpretation of the bank holding company act of 1956 the “bhc act” this ownership interest causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for purposes of the bhc act as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc blackrock is subject to banking regulation including the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that blackrock may conduct the federal reserve has broad enforcement authority over blackrock including the power to prohibit blackrock from conducting any activity that in the federal reserve’s opinion is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations pnc is regulated as a “financial holding company” under the bhc act which allows pnc and blackrock to engage in a much broader set of activities than would otherwise be permitted under the bhc act any failure of pnc to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain blackrock activities and its growth furthermore the volcker rule which is a part of the bhc act will affect the method by which blackrock invests in and operates its private investment funds including private equity funds hedge funds and funds of funds blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary is also subject to regulation by the occ and is subject to capital requirements established by the occ the occ has broad enforcement authority over blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary being subject to banking regulation including the volcker rule may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations in the european union in which blackrock operates could result in substantial harm to blackrock’s reputation and results of operations 

in the aftermath of the financial crisis the european commission set out a detailed plan for eu financial reform outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives regulations and recommendations of which the review of the markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” was a part these together with the changes introduced by the alternative investment fund managers directive “aifmd” will have direct and indirect effects on blackrock’s operations in the european economic area including increased compliance disclosure and other obligations which could adversely impact blackrock’s ability to expand in these markets

investment firms which became effective on january 1 2014 will have direct and indirect impacts on the company’s euregulated subsidiaries 

failure to comply with laws and regulations in the asiapacific region and other nonus jurisdictions in which blackrock operates could result in substantial harm to blackrock’s reputation and results of operations

in australia blackrock’s subsidiaries are subject to various australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the australian securities and investments commission “asic” asic regulates companies and financial services in australia and is responsible for promoting investor creditor and consumer protection failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation suspension or variation of the relevant subsidiaries’ licenses in australia

failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to blackrock’s reputation and results of operations 

of note among the various international regulations to which blackrock is subject are the extensive and increasingly 

stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels thresholds across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the company the specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions blackrock continues to invest in technology training and personnel to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures despite these investments the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the company and high volume of securities trading pose a risk that errors or omissions will occasionally occur which could have an adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation and results of operation

additionally any new legislation modification or interpretation of tax laws could also impact blackrock’s corporate tax position the application of complex tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business us and nonus tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock these challenges may result in adjustments to or impact the timing or amount of taxable income deductions or other tax allocations which may adversely affect blackrock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition 

legal proceedings could adversely affect operating results financial condition and cash flows for a particular period 

many aspects of blackrock’s business involve substantial risks of legal liability the company certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with blackrock’s activities certain blackrock subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination special inquiries and potential proceedings’ by regulatory authorities including the sec occ dol cftc and fca these examinations inquiries and proceedings could if compliance failures or other violations are found cause the sec to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations including censure termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to secregistered funds and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the company’s reputation any of which could cause its earnings to decline from time to time blackrock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various us and nonus governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industrywide companyspecific or other investigations or proceedings additionally certain of the

italian securities regulator proceeding 

the italian securities regulator commissione nazionale per le societa e la borsa “consob” initiated a civil proceeding on january 3 2014 against nigel bolton a portfolio manager and head of blackrock investment management uk limited’s european equity team “eet” in connection with 

the sale of shares in the italian oil and gas services company saipem spa in january 2013 

consob alleges that mr bolton on behalf of certain blackrock clients sold or influenced the sale of approximately 107 million shares of saipem using material nonpublic information thereby avoiding client losses of over € 1145 million the eet’s sale of saipem shares occurred between january 25 and january 29 2013 and saipem announced negative news following the market close on january 29 2013 while blackrock is not charged in the proceeding it may be liable for the actions of its employee 

blackrock conducted a thorough investigation and found no evidence to support the allegations as a result of the investigation blackrock believes that the sale of saipem shares was made as a fiduciary based on publicly available information that was widely disseminated in the marketplace including negative publicity and a thirdparty analyst research report reducing earnings estimates which was issued to the market before trading on january 25 2013 

consob also alleges that blackrock declined to provide consob with information and was an obstacle to consob’s investigation blackrock believes it has fully cooperated with consob and it will continue to do so 

while under italian law the potential penalty could be greater than the loss actually avoided blackrock believes that mr bolton will not be found liable and as a result neither mr bolton nor blackrock will incur any penalty 

all legal proceedings 

management after consultation with legal counsel currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability if any arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material effect on blackrock’s results of operations financial position or cash flows however there is no assurance as to whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material effect on blackrock’s results of operations financial position or cash flows in any future reporting period due to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of these matters management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters

blackrock’s key client themes — income alternatives outcome investing strategic beta emerging markets and retirement solutions — are expected to drive the company’s organic growth across its businesses 

blackrock’s retail strategy is focused on an outcomeoriented approach to creating client solutions including active passive and alternative products and enhanced distribution in the united states blackrock is leveraging its integrated wholesaler force to further penetrate wire house distribution platforms and gain share amongst registered investment advisors internationally blackrock continues to diversify the range of investment solutions available to clients penetrate new distribution segments and capitalize on regulatory change impacting retrocession arrangements

assuming a stable market environment blackrock anticipates that organic growth coupled with the benefits of scale should result in increasing operating margins over time 

blackrock believes that earnings growth and shareholder returns should also be positively impacted by the company’s commitment to a consistent and predictable capital management strategy 

nongaap financial measures 

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with gaap however management believes evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap basis financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators 

for both management and investors of blackrock’s financial performance over time blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 

computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows 

a operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted 

operating income as adjusted equals operating income gaap basis excluding certain items management deems nonrecurring recurring infrequently or transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value as indicated in the table below management believes operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time and therefore provide useful disclosure to investors 

 

 

   



 management believes operating income exclusive of these items is a useful measure in evaluating blackrock’s operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented 

 



 

 

 

 operating income used for measuring operating margin as adjusted is equal to operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and related commissions management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact blackrock’s results until future periods 

revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services which due to the terms of the contracts are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time substantially offset distribution fee revenue the company earns for each of these items blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues 

b nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests as adjusted is presented below the compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income this compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans which are reported in nonoperating income expense gaap basis 

management believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides comparability of information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock’s nonoperating contribution to results as compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans which is included in operating income substantially offsets the gain loss on the investments set aside for these plans management believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides a useful measure for both management and investors of blackrock’s nonoperating results that impact book value during 2013 the noncash nonoperating pretax gain of 80 million related to the contributed pennymac investment 

has been excluded from nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature and because the more than offsetting associated charitable contribution expense of 124 million is reported in operating income 

 

 c net income attributable to blackrock as adjusted management believes net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted and diluted earnings per common share as adjusted are useful measures of blackrock’s profitability and financial performance net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted equals net income attributable to blackrock inc gaap basis adjusted for significant nonrecurring items charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow 

see note a operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted for information on the pnc ltip funding obligation merrill lynch compensation contribution charitable contribution uk lease exit costs contribution to stifs and restructuring charges 

the 2013 results included a tax benefit of approximately 48 million recognized in connection with the charitable contribution the tax benefit has been excluded from net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted due to the nonrecurring nature of the charitable contribution during 2013 income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities including the effect of legislation enacted in the united kingdom and domestic state and local income tax changes during 2012 income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities including the effect of legislation enacted in the united kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the company’s organizational structure during 2011 income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to a state tax election and enacted uk japan us state and local tax legislation the resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented

purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business blackrock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of blackrock purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty at december 31 2013 the company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio market data officerelated services and thirdparty marketing and promotional services purchase obligations are recorded on the company’s financial statements when services are provided and as such obligations for services not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31 2013 

investment commitments at december 31 2013 the company had 216 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds including funds of private equity funds real estate funds infrastructure funds opportunistic funds and distressed credit funds this amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying thirdparty funds as thirdparty noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds generally the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment these unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition these commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the company but which are not yet legally binding the company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for and with its clients 

carried interest clawback as a general partner in certain investment funds including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds the company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements the company may from time to time be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the 

limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements therefore blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed and as a deferred carried interest liability on its consolidated statements of financial condition carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fees on blackrock’s consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable 

contingent payments related to business acquisitions  in connection with the credit suisse etf transaction blackrock is required to make contingent payments annually to credit suisse subject to achieving specified thresholds during a seven year period subsequent to the acquisition date in addition blackrock is required to make contingent payments related to the mgpa transaction during a five year period subject to achieving specified thresholds subsequent to the acquisition date the fair value of the contingent payments at december 31 2013 is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition and is included in other liabilities

indemnifications in many of the company’s contracts including the bgi merrill lynch investment managers “mlim” and quellos transaction agreements blackrock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances the terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability if any cannot be determined and therefore has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31 2013 see further discussion in note 13 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k 

on behalf of certain clients the company lends securities to highly rated banks and brokerdealers in these securities lending transactions the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral blackrock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential losses resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligations under the securities lending agreement at december 31 2013 the company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately 1183 billion the company held as agent cash and securities totaling 1246 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31 2013 the fair value of these indemnifications was not material at december 31 2013 the company currently expects indemnified balances to continue to increase over time 

while the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement in the event of a borrower default the company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations if the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations 

 

 

 

to a client for whom the company has provided indemnification blackrock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall these indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above and do not in any way guarantee assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested 

contingent distribution obligations in november 2010 blackrock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with merrill lynch which requires the company to make payments to merrill lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of aum maintained in certain blackrock products the initial term of the agreement remained in effect until january 2014 after such term the agreement renewed for one automatic threeyear extension 

the following items have not been included in the contractual obligations commitments and contingencies table 

compensation and benefit obligations the company has various compensation and benefit obligations including bonuses commissions and incentive payments payable defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations and deferred compensation arrangements that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above these arrangements are discussed in more detail in note 14 stockbased compensation  and note 15 employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k accrued compensation and benefits at december 31 2013 totaled 1747 million and included incentive compensation of 1335 million deferred compensation of 164 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of 248 million substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2014 while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods up to five years 

separate account liabilities at december 31 2013 the company had 1551 billion of separate account assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition the timing of payments of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer as such these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k 

consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products collectively “investment products” is determined pursuant to asc 810 consolidation  the accounting method used by the company depends upon the influence the company has over its investee the investment product to the extent that blackrock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product which generally exists if there is a 50 or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights blackrock consolidates the investment product 

for investment products in which blackrock’s voting interest is less than 50 an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a vie or a voting rights entity 

consolidation of variable interest entities  certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed vies blackrock reviews factors including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns to determine if the investment product is a vie blackrock continuously evaluates such factors as facts and circumstances change blackrock is required to consolidate a vie when it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary “pb” 

accounting standards update “asu” 201010 amendments to statement 167 for certain investment funds “asu 201010” defers the application of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r for certain investment funds including money market funds the pb of a vie that is an investment fund that meets the conditions of asu 201010 is the enterprise that has a variable interest or combination of variable interests including those of related parties that absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual 

returns or both the pb of a vie that does not meet the conditions for deferral in asu 201010 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie 

significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the company is the pb of a vie if the company is determined to be the pb of a vie blackrock will consolidate the entity in order to determine whether the company is the pb of a vie for entities that meet the conditions of asu 201010 management must make significant estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows assumptions made in such analyses include but are not limited to market prices of securities market interest rates potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities prepayments realization of gains liquidity or marketability of certain securities discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes 

in the normal course of business the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles including collateralized debt obligations “cdos” or clos that do not meet the conditions of asu 201010 and sponsored investment funds which may be considered vies 

 

 

 

at december 31 2013 the following balances related to vies were included on the consolidated statements of financial condition 

 

   

clos at december 31 2013 blackrock was the manager of over 20 closcdos and other securitization entities blackrock was determined to be the pb for certain of these clos which required blackrock to consolidate these vies blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities of the clos that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie the company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities of the clos recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition as the clo noteholders ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the clos’ assets and liabilities changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of these clos have no impact on net income attributable to blackrock or its cash flows excluding outstanding management receivables the company has no risk of loss with its involvement with these vies 

sponsored private equity fund of funds at december 31 2013 blackrock was determined to be the pb of one investment fund of funds and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its defacto relatedparty relationships with other partners in the fund which limited the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without blackrock’s consent as the general partner of the fund changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this vie recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition have no impact on net income attributable to blackrock excluding outstanding management fee receivables the company has no risk of loss related to its involvement with this vie 

consolidation of voting rights entities  to the extent that blackrock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which generally exists if there is a 50 or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights blackrock consolidates the investee 

the company as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies pursuant to asc 81020 control of partnerships and similar entities “asc 81020” the company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether other nonaffiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the 

substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the investment vehicle or otherwise to remove blackrock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote or have other substantive participating rights if the investment vehicle is not a vie and the presumption of control is not overcome blackrock will consolidate the investment vehicle 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities including products where blackrock owns 50 or greater of the voting rights of the product under the consolidation policies described above the company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition 

 

 the company retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to asc 810 vies including a consolidated sponsored investment fund and clos were excluded from the balances above as the balances of these vies are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition 

investments 

equity method investments  for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where it is not the pb of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company follows the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the 

 

 

 

terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity 

blackrock’s equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value therefore under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income expense for investments in investment companies or as other revenue for certain strategic investments which are recorded in other assets since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock’s core business 

at december 31 2013 the company had 736 million and 163 million of equity method investments including equity method investments held for deferred compensation reflected within investments and other assets respectively and at december 31 2012 the company had 604 million and 124 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets respectively 

impairment of investments the company’s management periodically assesses its equity method availableforsale heldtomaturity and cost investments for impairment if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist investments are evaluated using market values where available or the expected future cash flows of the investment if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the company’s carrying value of the investment an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income 

when the fair value of availableforsale securities is lower than cost the company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “otherthantemporary” in making this determination for equity securities the company considers among other factors the length of time the security has been in a loss position the extent to which the security’s market value is less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses if the impairment is considered otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income expense on the consolidated statement of income in making this determination for debt securities the company considers whether 1 it has the intent to sell the security 2 it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or 3 it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security if the company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered a credit loss the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 

fair value measurements 

hierarchy of fair value inputs the provisions of asc 820 fair value measurement “asc 820” establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and require companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs see note 2 significant accounting policies  for further description of the company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value 

significance of inputs the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument 

valuation techniques the fair values of certain level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various methodologies as appropriate including navs of underlying investments thirdparty pricing vendors broker quotes and market and income approaches such quotes and modeled prices are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures including due diligence reviews of thirdparty pricing vendors variance analyses consideration of the current market environment and other analytical procedures blackrock’s 574 million of level 3 investments or 27 of total gaap investments at december 31 2013 primarily included coinvestments in private equity fund of funds and private equity funds funds of hedge funds as well as alternative hedge funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities and real estate equity products 

as a practical expedient the company relies on nav as the fair value for certain investments the inputs to value these investments may include blackrock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments including distressed credit hedge funds real estate and private equity funds which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices the various partnerships are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricingvaluation information from thirdparty sources including independent appraisals however in some instances current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any thirdparty source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from thirdparty sources are not reliable in these instances fund management may perform modelbased analytical valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments 

a significant amount of inputs used to value equity debt securities and bank loans is sourced from wellrecognized thirdparty pricing vendors generally prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as level 2 

 

 

 

for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price annually blackrock’s internal valuation committee or other designated groups review both the valuation methodologies including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes and operational processes with these vendors in addition on a quarterly basis meetings are held with key vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ processes 

in addition quotes obtained from brokers generally are nonbinding and categorized as level 3 inputs however if the company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable the quote is classified as a level 2 input 

changes in valuation changes in value on 1622 million of investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense 183 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income 243 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 103 million relates to carried interest which will not impact nonoperating income expense at december 31 2013 changes in fair value of approximately 785 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact blackrock’s net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was 691 million 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary openend investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost in addition trade namestrademarks are considered indefinitelived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with the applicable provisions of asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other “asc 350” indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2013 ranged from 1 to 11 years with a weightedaverage remaining estimated useful life of 43 years 

goodwill the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment assessment performed as of july 31 2013 indicated that no impairment charge was required the company continuously monitors its book value per share as compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2013 the company’s common stock closed at 31647 which exceeded its book value per share of approximately 15669 after excluding appropriated retained earnings 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and whether the indefinitelife and finitelife classifications are still appropriate in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is less than its carrying value blackrock assesses various significant factors including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates in addition the company considers other factors including i macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or other developments in equity and credit markets ii industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates an increased competitive environment a decline in marketdependent multiples or metrics a change in the market for an entity’s services or regulatory legal or political developments and iii entityspecific events such as a change in management or key personnel overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs 

if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform an impairment test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion if the asset is determined to be impaired the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 161 million 157 million and 156 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

in 2013 2012 and 2011 the company performed impairment tests including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments in 2013 the company determined that no impairment charges were required the classification of indefinitelived versus finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles were required the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by asc 740 income taxes “asc 740” deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable 

 

 

 

outcomes actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2013 blackrock had 467 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 304 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

in accordance with asc 740 management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2013 the company had deferred tax assets of 4 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately 5085 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company 

asc 740 requires the company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

at december 31 2013 the company had recorded a deferred tax asset of 99 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the company expects to hold certain investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized however changes in circumstance could cause the company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change such changes may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements see note 21 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for further details 

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately 89 million and current income taxes payables of 168 million at december 31 2013 

revenue recognition investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or in the case of certain real estate clients net operating income generated by the underlying properties investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign 

exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers 

the company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the company manages such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund in certain cases the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the company bears no credit risk to the third party the company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with asc 60545 revenue recognition — principle agent considerations “asc 60545” and records its management fees net of retrocessions retrocessions for 2013 2012 and 2011 were 785 million 793 million and 928 million respectively the company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which due to the terms of the contracts are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income 

the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and brokerdealers such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis the securities loaned are secured by collateral generally ranging from 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities generally the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed for 2013 2012 and 2011 securities lending revenue totaled 447 million 510 million and 397 million respectively and is recorded in investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee 

the company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations including carried interest allocations from certain actively managed investment funds and certain smas these performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which varies by product or account and could be monthly quarterly annually or longer for the years ended 2013 2012 and 2011 performance fee revenue totaled 561 million 463 million and 371 million respectively in addition the company receives carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds blackrock may be required to return all or part of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these funds therefore blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2013 and 2012 the company had 108 million and 97 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition the ultimate recognition of performance fee revenue if any for these products is unknown 

 

 

 

fees earned for blackrock solutions  which include advisory services are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some or all of the following methods i percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform ii fixed fees and iii performance fees if contractual thresholds are met revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of onetime advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on aum of the respective portfolio assignment for 2013 2012 and 2011 blackrock solutions and advisory revenue totaled 577 million 518 million and 510 million respectively 

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of aum and since the company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

aum market price risk blackrock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on aum at december 31 2013 the majority of the company’s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end aum of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts movements in equity market prices interest ratescredit spreads foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of aum to decline which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees 

corporate investments portfolio risks as a leading investment management firm blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying measuring monitoring managing and analyzing market and operating risks including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio the board of directors of the company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the company requiring among other things that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the company and that certain investments may be referred to the audit committee or the board of directors depending on the circumstances for approval 

in the normal course of its business blackrock is exposed to equity market price risk interest ratecredit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments 

blackrock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including 

real estate private equity and hedge funds investments generally are made for coinvestment purposes to establish a performance track record to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes currently the company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments at december 31 2013 the company had outstanding total return swaps and interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately 117 million and 71 million respectively 

at december 31 2013 approximately 826 million of blackrock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by blackrock in accordance with gaap and therefore are consolidated even though blackrock may not own a majority of such funds excluding the impact of the federal reserve bank stock carried interest investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program the company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is 1583 million see management’s discussion and analysisbalance sheet overview  investments for further information on the company’s investments 

the “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented below 

equity market price risk at december 31 2013 the company’s net exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately 828 million of the company’s total economic investment exposure investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds the company estimates that a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately 828 million in the carrying value of such investments 

interest ratecredit spread risk at december 31 2013 the company was exposed to interestrate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately 755 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments in the aggregate would result in a decrease or increase of approximately 127 million in the carrying value of such investments 

foreign exchange rate risk as discussed above the company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes the carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies primarily the pound sterling and euro was 222 million at december 31 2013 a 10 adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a 222 million decline in the carrying value of such investments 

other market risks the company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange risk movements at december 31 2013 the company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately 792 million

assets under management 

a summary of the company’s aum for the years 2007 through 2012 is presented below 

aum by asset class 

december 31 

 

 component changes in aum by asset class 

five years ended december 31 2012 

 

  

     

aum represents the broad ranges of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing for example net asset value reported aum does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice or assets that we are retained to manage on a shortterm temporary basis 

investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of aum we also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreedupon benchmark or return hurdle on some products we also may earn securities lending fees in addition blackrock offers its proprietary aladdin ® investment system as well 

as risk management outsourcing and advisory services to institutional investors under the brs name revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions number of users accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives 

at december 31 2012 total aum was 3792 trillion representing a compounded annual growth rate of 23 over the last five years aum growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains net new business and acquisitions including bgi which added approximately 1844 trillion of aum in december 2009 and claymore and srpep which added 137 billion of aum in 2012 these acquisitions significantly changed our aum mix from predominantly active fixed income and equity in 2007 to a broadly diversified product range as described below 

 

  

the company considers the categorization of its aum by product type investment style client type and client region useful to understanding its business the following discussion of the company’s aum will be organized as follows 

 

 products 

component changes in aum by product type and investment style for 2012 are presented below 

 

   

at yearend 2012 products invested primarily in longterm assets represented 92 of total aum or 3482 trillion of which 53 were equity mandates 36 fixed income accounts 8 multiasset class portfolios and 3 alternative investments the remaining aum was in cash management products and advisory mandates representing longterm portfolio liquidation assignments net new business in longterm products totaled 1077 billion excluding the effect of two large lowfee nonetp index fixed income outflows from two institutional clients of 360 billion in the first quarter of 2012 and 742 billion in the third quarter of 2012 net inflows in longterm products excluding these outflows were augmented by net inflows into cash management products longterm and cash product net inflows were offset by advisory distributions due to the successful completion of asset dispositions related to the three maiden lane vehicles associated with the federal reserve bank of new york 

marking the repayment of all senior and junior obligations of the three vehicles and the generation of net gains benefiting the us public 

longterm product offerings include active and passive index strategies our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle alpha while maintaining an appropriate risk profile we offer two types of active strategies those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction in contrast passive strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index beta generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index passive strategies include both our institutional nonetp index products and ishares etps 

 

  

although many clients use both active and passive strategies the application of these strategies differs greatly for example clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class pending reallocation to an active manager this has the effect of increasing turnover of index aum in addition institutional nonetp index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and typically reflect low fee rates this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

equity 

yearend 2012 equity aum of 1845 trillion increased by 2854 billion or 18 from the end of 2011 largely due to flows into regional countryspecific and global mandates and the effect of higher market valuations equity aum growth included 540 billion in net new business and 36 billion in new assets related to the acquisition of claymore net new business of 540 billion was driven by net inflows of 530 billion and 191 billion into ishares and nonetp index accounts respectively passive inflows were offset by active net outflows of 181 billion with net outflows of 100 billion and 81 billion from fundamental and scientific active equity products respectively 

passive strategies represented 84 of equity aum with the remaining 16 in active mandates institutional investors represented 62 of equity aum while ishares and retail and hnw represented 29 and 9 respectively at yearend 2012 63 of equity aum was managed for clients in the americas defined as the united states caribbean canada latin america and iberia compared with 28 and 9 managed for clients in emea and asiapacific respectively 

blackrock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix approximately half of blackrock’s equity aum is tied to international markets including emerging markets which tend to have higher fee rates than similar us equity strategies accordingly fluctuations in international equity markets which do not consistently move in tandem with us markets may have a greater impact on blackrock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues 

fixed income 

fixed income aum ended 2012 at 1259 trillion rising 116 billion or 1 relative to december 31 2011 growth in aum reflected 433 billion in net new business excluding the two large previously mentioned lowfee outflows 754 billion in market and foreign exchange gains and 30 billion in new assets related to claymore net new business was led by flows into domestic specialty and global bond mandates with net inflows of 288 billion 136 billion and 31 billion into ishares  nonetp index and modelbased products respectively partially offset by net outflows of 22 billion from fundamental strategies 

fixed income aum was split between passive and active strategies with 48 and 52 respectively institutional investors represented 74 of fixed income aum while ishares and retail and hnw represented 15 and 11 respectively at yearend 2012 59 of fixed income aum was managed for clients in the americas compared with 33 and 8 managed for clients in emea and asiapacific respectively 

 

multiasset class 

component changes in multiasset class aum 

 

   

multiasset class aum totaled 2677 billion at yearend 2012 up 19 or 426 billion reflecting 158 billion in net new business and 267 billion in portfolio valuation gains blackrock’s multiasset class team manages a variety of bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities currencies bonds and commodities and our extensive risk management capabilities investment solutions might include a combination of longonly 

portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays 

at december 31 2012 institutional investors represented 66 of multiasset class aum while retail and hnw accounted for the remaining aum additionally 58 of multiasset class aum is managed for clients based in the americas with 37 and 5 managed for clients in emea and asiapacific respectively flows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our advice in an increasingly 

 

  

challenging investment environment with 150 billion or 95 of net inflows coming from institutional clients with the remaining 08 billion or 5 generated by retail and hnw clients defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows this client group added 131 billion of net new business in 2012 during the year americas net inflows of 185 billion were partially offset by net outflows of 26 billion collectively from emea and asiapacific clients 

the company’s multiasset strategies include the following 

 

  



  



 

 

alternatives 

component changes in alternatives aum 

 

   

alternatives aum totaled 1098 billion at yearend 2012 up 48 billion or 5 reflecting 33 billion in portfolio valuation gains and 70 billion in new assets related to the acquisitions of srpep which deepened our alternatives footprint in the european and asian markets and claymore core alternative outflows of 39 billion were driven almost exclusively by return of capital to clients currency net outflows of 50 billion were partially offset by net inflows of 35 billion into ishares commodity funds 

we continued to make significant investments in our alternatives platform as demonstrated by our acquisition of srpep successful closes on the renewable power initiative and our build out of an alternatives retail platform which now stands at nearly 100 billion in aum 

we believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies to best meet their investment objectives they will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings 

institutional investors represented 69 or 758 billion of alternatives aum with retail and hnw investors comprising an additional 9 or 97 billion at yearend 2012 ishares commodity products accounted for the remaining 243 billion or 22 of aum at yearend alternative clients are geographically diversified with 56 26 and 18 of clients located in the americas emea and asiapacific respectively 

the blackrock alternative investors “bai” group coordinates our alternative investment efforts including 

 

  

product management business development and client service our alternatives products fall into two main categories – core which includes hedge funds funds of funds hedge funds and private equity and real estate offerings and currency and commodities the products offered under the bai umbrella are described below 

core  

 

  

  



currency and commodities aum in currency and commodities strategies totaled 414 billion at yearend 2012 flat from yearend 2011 reflecting net outflows of 15 billion primarily from active currency and currency overlays and 08 billion of market and foreign exchange gains claymore also contributed 09 billion of aum currency and commodities products include a range of active and passive products our ishares commodities products represented 243 billion of aum including 07 billion acquired from claymore and are not eligible for performance fees 

cash management 

cash management aum totaled 2637 billion at december 31 2012 up 91 billion or 4 from yearend 2011 cash management products include taxable and taxexempt money market funds and customized separate accounts portfolios may be denominated in us dollar euro or british pound 

at yearend 2012 84 of cash aum was managed for institutions and 16 for retail and hnw investors the investor base was also predominantly in the americas with 69 of aum managed for investors in the americas and 31 for clients in other regions mostly emeabased we generated net inflows of 50 billion during 2012 reflecting continued uncertainty around future regulatory changes and a challenging investing environment to meet investor needs we sought to provide new solutions and choices for our clients by launching short duration products in the united states which both immediately address the challenge of a continuing low interest rate environment and will also be important investment options should regulatory changes occur in the emea business and in particular for our euro product set we have taken action to ensure that we can provide effective cash management solutions in the face of a potentially negative yield environment by taking steps to launch new products and reengineer our existing product set 

 

 

ishares 

our industryleading us and international ishares etp suite is discussed below 

component changes in aum – ishares 

 

   

the etp industry experienced a banner year as annual inflow records from 2008 were broken in the united states the asiapacific region and on a global basis propelled by exceptional growth in fixed income and emerging markets equity products 1  the industry saw 260 billion 1 of net new business representing 17 in organic growth during 2012 with yearend aum totaling 1902 trillion 1  

the global growth of the etp market reflects both continued adoption and new product introduction with investor product preferences driven to varying degrees by performance as measured by tracking error which is the difference between net returns on the etp and the corresponding targeted index liquidity bidask spread taxefficiency transparency and client service fixed income and emerging markets were drivers of industry growth fixed income etps globally gathered a record 70 billion of net inflows 54 billion of which was uslisted led by investment grade and high yield demand as investors shunned the record low yields of government securities in favor of higher yielding products both developed and emerging markets equity etps saw strong inflows in 2012 as central banks around the world continued to pump liquidity into the global economy via asset purchase programs and accommodative monetary policy to help spur economic growth us equity etps globally had inflows of 116 billion 82 billion of which was into uslisted funds and emerging markets equity etps globally had 55 billion of net inflows 30 billion of which was into uslisted funds 1 

ishares is the leading etp provider in the world with 7527 billion of aum at december 31 2012 which increased 1594 billion or 27 since yearend 2011 ishares was the top asset gatherer globally in 2012 1 with 852 billion of net inflows for an organic growth rate of 14 with additional aum growth of 669 billion due to market valuation improvements during 2012 ishares introduced 85 new etps acquired claymore’s 35 etps in canada and continued our dual commitment to innovation and responsible product structuring our broad product range offers investors a precise transparent and lowcost way to tap market returns and gain access to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult or expensive for many investors to access until now as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and costefficiently 

at yearend ishares aum included 5347 billion or 71 in equity offerings 1929 billion or 26 in fixed income etps and 252 billion or 3 in multiasset class and alternative investments ishares equity aum increased 1150 billion or 27 from yearend 2011 with 530 billion in net inflows and 585 billion of market and 

 



foreign exchange valuation gains ishares fixed income aum rose 391 billion or 25 over the previous year with 74 of the increase being driven by 288 billion of net inflows ishares multiasset class and alternatives aum grew by 53 billion or 27 with 34 billion of net inflows predominantly into gold commodity products resulting from a macro environment dominated by accommodative monetary policies and resulting currency debasement with an additional 11 billion of market and foreign exchange valuation gains 

ishares offers the most diverse product set in the industry with 621 etps at yearend 2012 and serves the broadest client base covering 27 countries on five continents including north america south america europe asia and australia  ishares was the etp leader in asset gathering in 2012 with four of the top ten products and the highest number of leading products as measured by total assets with five of the top ten 1  notwithstanding an increase in the number of etp products offered in the industry ishares continued to maintain the largest share of global aum with 39 at december 31 2012 1  

 

  

 in addition we were the largest etp manager in latin america with over 85 of aum at december 31 2012 1  we continue to look for opportunities to further diversify product offerings in key strategic focus areas including attractive highgrowth markets both organically and 

 

  

through acquisitions as demonstrated by our acquisition of claymore and our 2013 agreement with credit suisse to acquire their etf business the closing of which is subject to customary closing conditions 

in general we expect to maintain relatively stable pricing so long as it is supported by performance and the ishares value proposition although we continually seek to achieve efficiencies and pass them on to our clients 

 

 

clients 

we serve a diverse mix of institutional and retail investors worldwide clients include taxexempt institutions such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans charities foundations and endowments official institutions such as central banks sovereign wealth funds supranationals and other government entities taxable institutions including insurance companies financial institutions corporations and thirdparty fund sponsors and retail and hnw investors we also serve both institutional and retail and hnw investors who acquire ishares on exchanges worldwide ishares is presented under “products” above with investments in ishares by institutions and retail and hnw clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections below 

aum by style  client type 

december 31 2012 

 

   

in 2012 we completed an internal reorganization of the firm structuring ourselves to ensure that strong investment performance is our highest priority and better align with our clients’ needs to capitalize on broader industry trends specifically we organized the client side of our business into two groups one comprising retail and ishares and another comprising institutional and blackrock solutions  the separation of the client 

functions into these two teams allows us to better focus on the unique needs of these client groups by bringing the full capabilities of the firm to bear in an organized cohesive approach additionally we split our investments functions into five distinct strategies alpha beta multiasset alternatives and tradingliquidity this new organizational structure allows us to enhance our focus on performance and client engagement

december 31 2012 

 

   

longterm assets managed for institutional investors totaled 2326 trillion or 61 of total aum at yearend 2012 during the year net outflows in longterm products totaled 992 billion which includes two large lowfee nonetp index fixed income outflows from two institutional clients totaling 1102 billion excluding these outflows longterm net new business from institutional clients totaled 110 billion with investment performance market appreciation and foreign exchange valuation gains contributing 2379 billion to aum growth

industry flows were led by equities with net inflows of 205 billion with flows primarily into global mandates as clients increasingly looked to use passive vehicles for macro exposure as they modestly rerisked in 2012 institutional nonetp index equity aum crossed the 1 trillion threshold excluding the two previously mentioned outflows fixed income garnered net inflows of 136 billion led by flows into us sector specialty and global bond mandates while institutional nonetp index represented 41 of longterm firm aum it accounted for 11 of longterm base fees

in fma the nature of assignments is shifting to longerterm advisory and risk monitoring engagements advisory aum decreased 62 to 455 billion driven by 745 billion of planned client distributions reflecting our continued success in disposing of assets for clients at or above targeted levels 

securities lending 

securities lending which is offered as a potential source of incremental returns on longterm portfolios is managed by a dedicated team supported by quantitative analysis proprietary technology and disciplined risk management the cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings andor as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral the value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the corresponding asset class being managed the value of the collateral is not included in aum 

outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately 134 billion up from 122 billion at yearend 2011 spreads were approximately flat compared to 2011 as lending premiums increased and offset declining cash reinvestment spreads the proportion of securities commanding premium lending fees grew slowly through the year and started 2012 above the 2011 average 

blackrock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality liquidity and superior client service through all market cycles disciplined risk management including a rigorous credit surveillance process is an integral part of the investment process blackrock’s cash management risk committee has established risk limits such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits across many of the products blackrock manages including over all of its cash management products in the ordinary course of our business there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed no such instances individually or in the aggregate have been material to the company to the extent that daily evaluationreporting of the profile of the portfolios identifies that a limit has been exceeded the relevant portfolio will be adjusted to the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers while a risk limit may be waived such temporary waivers are infrequent 

 

  

risk  quantitative analysis 

across all asset classes in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams the risk  quantitative analysis “rqa” group at blackrock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and thirdparty data to identify measure and manage a wide range of risks rqa provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk managementrelated analytical and information requirements where appropriate rqa will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics 

competition 

blackrock competes with investment management firms mutual fund complexes insurance companies banks brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to or alternatives to those offered by blackrock in order to grow its business blackrock must be able to compete effectively for aum key competitive factors include investment performance track records the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products investment style and discipline client service and brand name recognition historically the company has competed principally on the basis of its longterm investment performance track record its investment process its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service these factors may place blackrock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing aum and to attract new business will be successful

regulatory reform 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “dfa” was signed into law in the united states the dfa is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be fully implemented the continued adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the dfa on blackrock and other financial services firms the dfa may significantly change blackrock’s operating environment and the financial markets in general in unpredictable ways it is not possible to predict the ultimate effects that the dfa or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions will have upon blackrock’s business financial condition and results of operations among the potential impacts provisions of the dfa referred to as the volcker rule could to the extent the final volcker rule is determined to apply to blackrock’s activities affect the extent to which blackrock invests in and transacts with certain of its investment funds including private equity funds hedge funds and fund of funds platforms the impact of the volcker rule on liquidity and pricing in the broader financial markets is unknown at this time for a further discussion of the volcker rule see “item 1a – risk factors – legal and regulatory risks” in addition blackrock could be designated a systemically important financial institution “sifi” and become subject to direct supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” if blackrock were designated a sifi it could be subject to enhanced prudential supervisory and other requirements such as riskbased capital requirements leverage limits liquidity requirements resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements concentration limits a contingent capital requirement enhanced public disclosures shortterm debt limits and overall risk management requirements further new regulations under the dfa relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives will impact the manner by which blackrock and blackrockadvised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives and may significantly increase the costs of derivatives trading similarly blackrock’s management of funds and accounts that use and trade swaps and derivatives could be adversely impacted by recently adopted changes to the commodity futures trading commission’s the “cftc” regulations these rule changes include those concerning among other things the registration and regulation of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors and the accompanying registration and regulation of such entities by the national futures association the “nfa” the registration status of dealer counterparties and other counterparties who are major participants in the swap markets and requirements concerning mandatory clearing of certain swap transactions jurisdictions outside the united states 

in which blackrock operates are also in the process of devising or considering more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could have a similar impact on blackrock and the broader markets 

the dfa and its regulations and other new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities require blackrock to change certain business practices divert management’s time and attention from blackrock’s business activities to compliance activities and expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and tax costs and liabilities as well as reputational harm for example in addition to regulatory changes mandated by the dfa the securities and exchange commission the “sec” continues to review the role of and risks related to money market funds and has indicated that it may adopt additional regulations some of the proposed changes if adopted could significantly alter money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry in 2012 the office of the comptroller of the currency of the united states the “occ” amended the regulations governing bankmaintained shortterm investment funds “stifs” to include new disclosure requirements regarding portfolio holdings and to more closely align portfolio limitations such as maximum weighted average maturity and weighted average life with those applicable to sec registered money market funds similarly the sec continues to review the distribution fees paid to mutual fund distributors under rule 12b1 under the investment company act of 1940 the “investment company act” which are important to a number of the mutual funds blackrock manages any changes to 12b1 fees would alter the way blackrock’s distribution partners distribute blackrock products additionally the sec the internal revenue service “irs” and the cftc each continue to review the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds and such reviews could result in regulations that further limit the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds if adopted these limitations could require blackrock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the cftc which could result in additional costs andor restrictions in addition blackrock has begun reporting certain information about a number of its private funds to the sec and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the cftc pursuant to systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies which have required and will continue to require investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting still another example of changes in the regulatory landscape was the irs’ implementation of foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” fatca was enacted in 2010 and is intended to address tax compliance issues associated with us taxpayers with foreign accounts fatca requires foreign 

 

  

financial institutions to report to the irs information about financial accounts held by us taxpayers and imposes withholding documentation and reporting requirements on foreign financial institutions final regulations were issued by the irs on january 17 2013 with the earliest effective dates beginning in january 1 2014 in many instances however the precise nature of what needs to be implemented will be governed by bilateral intergovernmental agreements “igas” between the united states and the countries in which blackrock does business many of these igas have yet to be concluded fatca could cause the company to incur significant administrative and compliance costs and subject clients to us tax withholding 

an example of changes in the regulatory landscape in europe is the european union “eu” alternative investment fund managers directive “aifmd” which became effective on july 21 2011 and is required to be implemented by eu member states by july 22 2013 the aifmd regulates managers of and service providers to a broad range of alternative investment funds “aifs” domiciled within and depending on the precise circumstances outside the eu the aifmd also regulates the marketing of all aifs inside the european economic area the “eea” in general the aifmd is expected to have a staged implementation between mid2013 and 2018 compliance with the aifmd’s requirements may restrict aif marketing and will place additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration capital requirements leverage valuation stakes in eu companies depositaries the domicile of custodians and liquidity management 

globally regulators are examining the potential risks in etfs and may impose additional regulations on etfs including requirements to promote increased transparency and to limit the ability of etfs to utilize derivatives the international organization of securities commissions is also examining the appropriate level of regulatory oversight of financial benchmarks whether standards should apply to methodologies for benchmark calculation and transparency and governance issues in the benchmarking process any of these regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions could materially and adversely impact the value of assets in which blackrock has invested directly andor on behalf of clients and to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms could make it more difficult for blackrock to conduct certain businesses or distinguish itself from competitors 

additional legislation changes in rules promulgated by regulators and selfregulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations may directly affect the method of operation 

and profitability of blackrock blackrock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce see the “–nonus regulation” section below for a further discussion of regulatory reforms being considered andor adopted outside of the united states 

us regulation 

blackrock and certain of its us subsidiaries are subject to regulation primarily at the federal level by the sec the department of labor the “dol” the federal reserve the occ the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” the nfa the cftc and other government agencies and regulatory bodies certain of blackrock’s us subsidiaries are also subject to various antiterrorist financing privacy antimoney laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies 

the investment advisers act of 1940 the “advisers act” imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as blackrock including recordkeeping operational and marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes stringent governance compliance operational disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors such as blackrock the sec is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the advisers act and the investment company act ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations noncompliance with the advisers act the investment company act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations sanctions disgorgement fines and reputational damage 

blackrock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” as well as the rules of various us and nonus securities exchanges and selfregulatory organizations including laws governing trading on inside information market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements eg short sale limits volume limitations reporting obligations and market regulation policies in the united states and globally depending on the scope of the rules to be adopted by the sec provisions added to the exchange act by the dfa may require certain blackrock subsidiaries to register as municipal advisors in relation to their services for state 

 

  

and local governments pension plans and other investment programs such as college savings plans in addition blackrock manages a variety of investment funds listed on us and nonus exchanges which are subject to the rules of such exchanges violation of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on the company’s activities and damage its reputation 

blackrock manages a variety of private pools of capital including hedge funds funds of hedge funds private equity funds cdos real estate funds collective investment trusts managed futures funds and hybrid funds congress regulators tax authorities and others continue to explore on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public increased regulation related to private pools of capital including changes with respect to investor eligibility certain limitations on trading activities recordkeeping and reporting the scope of antifraud protections safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters blackrock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation rulemaking or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators 

certain blackrock subsidiaries are subject to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the dol insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under erisa with respect to benefit plan clients erisa and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa prohibit certain transactions involving erisa plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require blackrock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty erisa also imposes additional compliance reporting and operational requirements on blackrock that otherwise are not applicable to nonbenefit plan clients 

blackrock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators “cpos” andor commodity trading advisors with the cftc and are members of the nfa additional blackrock entities may need to register as a cpo or commodity trading advisor as a result of recently enacted regulatory changes by the cftc the cftc and nfa each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments including swaps as a result of the dfa in which certain blackrock clients may invest three of blackrock’s other subsidiaries blackrock investments llc “bril” blackrock capital markets llc and blackrock execution services are registered with the sec as brokerdealers and are memberfirms of 

finra each brokerdealer has a membership agreement with finra that limits the scope of such brokerdealer’s permitted activities bril is also an approved person with the new york stock exchange “nyse” and a member of the municipal securities rulemaking board “msrb” subject to msrb rules 

us banking regulation 

pnc is a bank holding company and regulated as a “financial holding company” by the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of 1956 the “bhc act” based on pnc’s interests in and relationships with blackrock blackrock is deemed to be a nonbank subsidiary of pnc and is therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve and to most banking laws regulations and orders that apply to pnc including the volcker rule the supervision and regulation of pnc and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries its depositors the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation and the financial system as a whole rather than for the protection of stockholders creditors or clients of pnc or blackrock pnc’s relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of blackrock’s business blackrock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business 

btc is a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and is a member of the federal reserve system accordingly btc is examined and supervised by the occ and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the occ such as capital adequacy regulations governing fiduciaries conflicts of interest selfdealing and antimoney laundering laws and regulations btc is also subject to various federal reserve regulations applicable to member institutions such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of btc’s customers and not btc blackrock and its affiliates or blackrock’s stockholders 

blackrock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a “financial holding company” under the bhc act investment management is an authorized activity but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements which in some cases are more restrictive than those blackrock faces under applicable securities laws blackrock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory administrative or other services only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory 

 

  

interpretations the federal reserve has broad powers to approve deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for blackrock to conduct new activities acquire or divest businesses or assets or reconfigure existing operations there are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of pnc to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with blackrock or its funds pnc and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of blackrock’s businesses 

the federal reserve has broad enforcement authority over blackrock including the power to prohibit blackrock from conducting any activity that in the federal reserve’s opinion is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting blackrock’s business the federal reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws regulations and orders the dfa strengthened the federal reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s nonbank affiliates such as blackrock 

any failure of pnc to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain blackrock activities and its growth such a change of status could be caused by any failure of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized” by any examination downgrade of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries or by any failure of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act in addition the dfa broadened the requirements for maintaining financial holding company status by also requiring the holding company to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” 

nonus regulation 

blackrock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies and bodies and in certain cases are affected by us laws and regulations that have extraterritorial application as blackrock continues to expand its international presence a number of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory frameworks comparable to those affecting its operations in the united states 

the financial services authority the “fsa” currently regulates certain blackrock subsidiaries in the united kingdom authorization by the fsa is required to conduct any financial services related business in the united kingdom under the financial services and markets act 2000 the fsa’s rules made under that act govern a firm’s capital resources requirements senior management 

arrangements conduct of business interaction with clients and systems and controls the fsa also supervises the company’s ukregulated subsidiaries under a “close and continuous” regime – which include regular visits and meetings with senior management and control functions – to monitor the company’s compliance with regulatory requirements breaches of the fsa’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the company’s ukregulated subsidiaries in april 2013 the fsa is expected to be replaced by prudential regulation authority and the financial conduct authority pending formal implementation the fsa has introduced a shadow internal structure in anticipation of the creation of the prudential regulation authority and the financial conduct authority and the bank of england has created an interim financial policy committee 

in addition to the above the company’s ukregulated subsidiaries and other european subsidiaries and branches must comply with the paneuropean regulatory regime established by the markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” which became effective on november 1 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the eea as well as the capital requirements directive which delineates regulatory capital requirements mifid sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets it also includes pre and posttrade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements 

the united kingdom has adopted the mifid rules into national legislation and fsa regulations as have those other european jurisdictions in which blackrock has a presence excluding switzerland which is not part of the eu or eea a review of mifid by the european commission has led to the publication of a draft amendment directive and a draft new markets in financial instruments regulation the proposals if implemented are likely to result in changes to pre and posttrade reporting obligations and an expansion of the types of instruments subject to these requirements they may affect the buying and selling of derivatives by moving most derivative trading onto regulated trading venues and may control the activities of algorithmic trading the proposals may also result in changes to conduct of business requirements including selling practices intermediary inducements and client categorization the proposals also envisage giving the european commission power to ban certain products and services a further european commission regulation the european market infrastructure regulation “emir” was adopted in august 2012 and requires the central clearing of standardized otc derivatives and the mandatory reporting of all derivative contracts some of the emir technical standards have recently been finalized and the remainder are expected to be finalized in 2013 

 

  

in addition the fsa has finalized rules relating to its retail distribution review these rules which came into effect on december 31 2012 have changed how retail clients pay for investment advice given in respect of all retail investment products including openend and closedend funds structured products and insurancebased savings products the fsa is also considering further rules that would ban payments by product providers to distribution platforms for both advised and nonadvised business 

in the aftermath of the financial crisis the european commission set out a detailed plan for eu financial reform outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives regulations and recommendations of which the mifid review mentioned above was a part these together with the changes contemplated by the aifmd mentioned above will have direct and indirect effects on blackrock’s operations in the eea 

the european commission has also published proposals to replace the market abuse directive with a regulation on insider dealing and market manipulation and with an accompanying directive on criminal sanctions there are also ongoing plans to reform the framework to which regulated firms are subject including in relation to regulatory capital and the protection of client assets which will have a direct effect on some of blackrock’s european operations 

the next iteration of the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directive “ucits iv” was required to be adopted in the national law of each eu member state by july 1 2011 the united kingdom has adopted ucits iv requirements into national legislation and fsa regulation luxembourg and ireland have also adopted ucits iv into their national legislation however several other eu member states are still in various stages of the adoption process ucits iv introduced new requirements including a requirement on ucits funds to provide a key investor information document there are also european commission consultations in process that are intended to improve retail investor protection including ucits v which addresses among other items custodial liability and ucits vi which includes proposals on depositaries money market funds and product management 

proposals on packaged retail investment products “prips” are to be implemented through the strengthening of mifid standards for noninsurance prips revisions to the insurance mediation directive’s selling standard for all insurancebased prips and new investor disclosure requirements for all prips though a separate eu legislative process 

certain individual eu member states such as france and italy have enacted national financial transaction taxes “ftts” and a group of member states also could adopt an ftt under an eu enhanced cooperation procedure that would apply only in those member states in general any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that we manage in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products an ftt could significantly increase the operational costs of our entering into on behalf of our clients securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to an ftt which would adversely impact our revenues 

for the insurance sector the solvency ii process will increase the amount of capital that insurers will have to set aside and will have an indirect effect on fund managers with insurance clients the solvency ii process has been delayed from an original compliance date of january 1 2014 no new timetable has been currently proposed 

in addition to the fsa the activities of certain blackrock subsidiaries branches and representative offices are overseen by financial services regulators in germany the netherlands ireland luxembourg switzerland isle of man jersey france belgium italy poland south africa spain and sweden regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including among other things the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations in addition these regulators may subject certain blackrock subsidiaries to net capital requirements other blackrock subsidiaries branches and representative offices are regulated in japan australia china hong kong singapore taiwan south korea india dubai cayman islands brazil chile mexico and canada 

in japan a blackrock subsidiary is subject to the financial instruments and exchange law the “fiel” and the law concerning investment trusts and investment corporations these laws are administered and enforced by the japanese financial services agency the “jfsa” which establishes standards for compliance including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules the jfsa is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure fine the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the fiel 

 

  

in australia blackrock’s subsidiaries are subject to various australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the australian securities and investments commission “asic” and the australian prudential regulation authority “apra” asic regulates companies and financial services in australia and is responsible for promoting investor creditor and consumer protection apra is the prudential regulator of the australian financial services industry and oversees banks credit unions building societies general insurance and reinsurance companies life insurance friendly societies and most members of the superannuation pension industry failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in australia 

the activities of certain blackrock subsidiaries in hong kong are subject to the securities and futures ordinance the “sfo” which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates among others offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries the sfo is administered by the securities and futures commission the “sfc” the sfc is also empowered under the sfo to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines the relevant blackrock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the sfo are required to be licensed with the sfc and are subject to the rules codes and guidelines issued by the sfc from time to time failure to comply with the applicable laws regulations codes and guidelines issued by the sfc could result in the suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the sfc 

there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other nonus jurisdictions where blackrock’s subsidiaries are authorized to conduct business

risks related to blackrock’s business and competition 

changes in the value levels of the capital commodities or currency markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in revenues and earnings 

blackrock’s investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns earned on aum movements in equity debt commodity real estate or alternative investment market prices interest rates or foreign exchange rates could cause 

 

  



 

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of any of these events could result in lower investment advisory administration and performance fees or earnings and cause the company’s stock price to decline 

poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues and earnings 

the company’s management believes that investment performance including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of aum poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could reduce revenues and cause earnings to decline as a result of 

 

  

  

  

 the determination to provide support to particular products from time to time or provide securities lending indemnifications may reduce earnings or other investments in the business 

blackrock may at its option from time to time support investment products through capital or credit support such support and indemnifications utilize capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes losses or prohibitions on such support and indemnifications or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products and securities lending could have an adverse impact on revenues and earnings 

on behalf of certain clients blackrock lends securities to highly rated banks and brokerdealers in these securities lending transactions the borrower is required to provide 

and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral blackrock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligations under the securities lending agreement these indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above and do not guarantee assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested the amount of securities on loan as of december 31 2012 and subject to indemnification was 995 billion blackrock held as agent cash and securities totaling 1048 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31 2012 blackrock expects indemnified balances to increase over time 

while the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed in the event of a borrower default blackrock can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations if the amount of pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill obligations to a client for whom blackrock has provided indemnification blackrock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall which could result in additional costs to blackrock that cannot be estimated with certainty at this time 

changes in the value levels of the capital markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in the value of investments that blackrock owns 

at december 31 2012 blackrock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately 12 billion in its investments see “item 7a – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” primarily resulted from coinvestments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds a decline in the prices of equity or debt securities or the value of real estate or other alternative investments within or outside the united states could lower the value of these investments and result in a decline of nonoperating income and an increase in the volatility of blackrock’s earnings 

continued capital losses on investments could have adverse income tax consequences 

the company may generate realized and unrealized capital losses on seed investments and coinvestments 

 

  

realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes the company has unrealized capital losses for which a deferred tax asset has been established in the event such unrealized losses are realized the company may not be able to offset such losses within the carryback or carryforward period or from future realized capital gains in which case the deferred tax asset will not be realized the failure to utilize the deferred tax asset could materially increase blackrock’s income tax expense 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect blackrock 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships blackrock and the products and accounts that it manages have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks clearing organizations mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose blackrock or the funds and accounts that it manages to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client while blackrock regularly conducts assessments of such risk posed by its counterparties the risk of nonperformance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets including the effects of the european sovereign debt crisis andor a collapse of the eurozone financial system there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely impact blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

the failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to reduced aum in similar products of blackrock without regard to the performance of blackrock’s products 

the failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products of blackrock without regard to the performance of blackrock’s products such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on the company’s aum revenues and earnings 

loss of employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

the ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to blackrock’s growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining 

clients the market for qualified fund managers investment analysts financial advisers and other professionals is competitive there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel loss of personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

separate account and commingled trust clients may terminate their investment management contracts with blackrock or withdraw funds on short notice the company has from time to time lost separate accounts and could in the future lose accounts or significant aum due to various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance 

additionally blackrock manages its us mutual funds closedend and exchangedtraded funds under management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds’ boards of directors annually a majority of the directors of each such fund are independent from blackrock consequently there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund managed by the company will approve the fund’s management contract each year or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the company  

further the governing agreements of many of the company’s private investment funds generally provide that subject to certain conditions investors in those funds and in some cases independent directors of those funds may remove blackrock as the investment adviser general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote resulting in a reduction in the management or performance fees as well as the total carried interest blackrock could earn 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against blackrock and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

when clients retain blackrock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf they typically specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the company is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to blackrock’s reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their aum or terminating their contracts any of which could cause the company’s revenues and earnings to decline 

 

  

competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins 

the investment management industry including the offering of exchangetraded funds is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry to the extent that blackrock is forced to compete on the basis of price it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline 

performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments performance fees represented 463 million or 5 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing earnings to be more volatile 

additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position 

blackrock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins these strategies have included hiring smallersized investment teams acquisitions of investment management businesses such as the mlim quellos and bgi transactions and other small and mediumsized strategic acquisitions these strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position in the investment management industry in the event blackrock pursues additional acquisitions it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from such acquisitions 

risks related to blackrock’s operations 

failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the company’s infrastructure including its technological capacity data centers and office space is vital to the 

competitiveness of its business the failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business including any expansion could impede the company’s productivity and growth which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline additionally the overall stability of the euro could pose operational risks to the company or the funds and accounts that it manages as a result of the adverse impacts that such issues may have on the company’s trading clearing or counterparty relationships 

failure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on blackrock and its products 

a significant portion of blackrock’s critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas including san francisco california new york new york and london england a major earthquake hurricane fire terrorist or other catastrophic event could result in disruption to the business the failure of the company to maintain updated adequate business continuity plans including secure backup facilities systems and personnel could impede the company’s ability to operate upon a disruption which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

operating in international markets increases blackrock’s operational regulatory and other risks 

as a result of blackrock’s extensive international business activities the company faces increased operational regulatory reputational and foreign exchange rate risks the failure of the company’s systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

failure to maintain a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

a key element to blackrock’s continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into blackrock’s aladdin technology platform that support investment advisory and brs clients moreover the company’s technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data and software the failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and brs clients there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes 

 

  

failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in blackrock’s earnings or stock price 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information and cyber security policies procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a hacker attack virus or worm or an internally caused issue such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information and could result in material financial loss loss of competitive position regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause a decline in the company’s earnings or stock price 

the failure of a key vendor to blackrock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on blackrock and its products 

blackrock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration accounting custody and transfer agent roles and other operational needs the failure or inability of blackrock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational issues for the company and in certain products which could result in financial losses for the company and its clients 

failure to manage risks in operating blackrock’s securities lending program for clients could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues and liquidity 

the size of blackrock’s securities lending programs increased significantly with the completion of the bgi transaction as part of these programs blackrock must manage risks associated with i ensuring that the value of the collateral held against the securities on loan does not decline in value or become illiquid and that its nature and value complies with regulatory requirements and investment requirements ii the potential that a borrower defaults or does not return a loaned security on a timely basis and iii errors in the settlement of securities daily marktomarket valuations and collateral collection the failure of the company’s controls to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for the company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs as well as for the company 

risks related to relationships with bank of americamerrill lynch pnc and other institutional investors 

merrill lynch is an important distributor of blackrock’s products and the company is therefore subject to risks associated with the business of merrill lynch 

under a global distribution agreement entered into with merrill lynch merrill lynch provides distribution portfolio administration and servicing for certain blackrock investment management products and services through its various distribution channels the company may not be successful in distributing products through merrill lynch or in distributing its products and services through other thirdparty distributors if blackrock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distributionrelated costs blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

loss of market share within merrill lynch’s global wealth  investment management business could harm operating results 

a significant portion of blackrock’s revenue has historically come from aum generated by merrill lynch’s global wealth  investment management “gwim” business blackrock’s ability to maintain a strong relationship within gwim is material to the company’s future performance if one of the company’s competitors gains significant additional market share within the gwim retail channel at the expense of blackrock then blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted 

pnc has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of pnc and merrill lynch 

as discussed in our proxy statement pnc has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement with blackrock as a consequence if the shares held by pnc constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval including elections of directors will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determinations of the blackrock board of directors this arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over blackrock in its board of directors whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the board at december 31 2012 pnc owned approximately 208 of blackrock’s voting common stock 

 

  

as discussed in our proxy statement pursuant to our stockholder agreement with pnc the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors or at least twothirds of the directors then in office

 currently merrill lynch and its affiliates own a de minimis number of shares of our capital stock 

pnc and several other institutional stockholders own a large portion of blackrock’s capital stock future sales of our common stock in the public market by the company or its large stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

legal and regulatory risks 

blackrock is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and internationally 

blackrock’s business is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and around the world see the discussion under “item 1 – business – regulation” violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines temporary or permanent prohibition of the engagement in certain activities reputational harm and related client terminations suspensions of personnel or revocation of their licenses suspension or termination of investment adviser or brokerdealer registrations or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on blackrock’s reputation business results of operations or financial condition and cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

blackrock may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes in the united states and internationally 

as previously mentioned in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “dfa” was signed into law the dfa is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be implemented the adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the dfa on blackrock blackrock is continuing to review the impact of the legislation and related rulemaking will have on its business financial condition and results of operations 

the business impact of the dfa and its regulations and other new laws or regulations including those affecting money market funds or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations in the united states or internationally could adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities could require blackrock to change certain business practices and could expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and tax costs 

the dfa charges the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” among the potential impacts of the dfa if blackrock were designated a systemically important financial institution a “sifi” it could be subject to these enhanced prudential supervisory and other requirements which individually or in the aggregate could adversely impact blackrock’s business and operations 

provisions of the dfa referred to as the “volcker rule” place limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries and affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain investment funds including hedge funds private equity funds and funds of those funds collectively “covered funds” it is expected that the volcker rule will apply to blackrock by virtue of blackrock’s relationship to pnc and blackrock could become subject to similar limitations if it is designated a sifi the volcker rule became effective on july 21 2012 however final implementing regulations have not yet been issued entities subject to the volcker rule will have until at least july 21 2014 to come into compliance with the provisions of the volcker rule to the extent the volcker rule applies to blackrock it would limit blackrock’s ability to make and retain investments in covered funds require blackrock to remove its name from the name of its covered funds and limit investments in covered funds by 

 

  

blackrock employees among other restrictions depending on the final implementation of the volcker rule and the granting of extensions blackrock could be required to sell certain seed and coinvestments that it holds including at a discount depending on market conditions the scope of the definition of “covered funds” is not yet known and therefore these restrictions could apply to funds other than those commonly referred to as hedge funds and private equity funds these limitations and restrictions could disadvantage blackrock against those competitors that are not subject to the volcker rule in the ability to attract clients into blackrock covered funds and to retain employees 

regulatory authorities including the securities and exchange commission the “sec” the fsoc and the international organization of securities commissions continue to focus on the need for additional regulations for money market mutual funds in november 2012 the fsoc issued proposed recommendations for money market mutual fund reform for public comment which closed on february 15 2013 the fsoc recommendations included floating the net asset value of funds requiring net asset value buffers and requiring that a portion of redemptions be held back by stable net asset value funds for a period of time the retention of capital and liquidity gates andor redemption fees if adopted by the sec these proposals could significantly affect money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry in light of the uncertainty regarding what changes may ultimately be adopted in a final sec rule we cannot predict what investor appetite will be for money market mutual fund products following the adoption of any such reforms or the impact of such reforms on blackrock 

in 2012 the office of the comptroller of the currency of the united states the “occ” amended the regulations governing bankmaintained shortterm investment funds “stifs” to include new disclosure requirements regarding portfolio holdings and to more closely align portfolio limitations such as maximum weighted average maturity and weighted average life with those applicable to sec registered money market funds as a result of the new occ rules blackrock chose to sell certain securities held within certain stifs during the fourth quarter of 2012 and to make a onetime contribution to the stifs to maintain the value of the funds while ensuring compliance with the occ rules as a result of the security sales these stifs are currently in compliance with the new occ rules the ultimate result of these rule changes is uncertain 

further regulations under the dfa relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner by which blackrockadvised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives and could significantly increase the costs of derivatives trading conducted by 

blackrock on behalf of its clients blackrock will also need to build new compliance mechanisms to monitor compliance with sec and commodity futures trading commission “cftc” rules concerning among other things the registration and regulation of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors and the accompanying registration and regulation of such entities by the national futures association the registration status of dealer counterparties and other counterparties who are major swap participants in the swap markets and requirements concerning mandatory clearing of certain swap transactions blackrock on behalf of its clients is also preparing for mandated central clearing of swaps and mandated trading venue requirements 

in addition blackrock has begun reporting certain information about a number of its private funds to the sec and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the cftc pursuant to systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies which have required and will continue to require investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting 

the sec the internal revenue service and the cftc each continue to review the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds which could result in regulations that further limit the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds if adopted these limitations could require blackrock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the cftc which could result in additional costs andor restrictions 

in addition in the aftermath of the financial crisis the european commission set out a detailed plan for eu financial reform outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives regulations and recommendations of which the review of the markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” was a part these together with the changes contemplated by the alternative investment fund managers directive “aifmd” will have direct and indirect effects on blackrock’s operations in the european economic area including increased compliance disclosure and other obligations which could impact blackrock’s ability to expand in these markets 

the foregoing regulatory changes and other reforms globally could also lead to business disruptions could adversely impact the value of assets in which blackrock has invested on behalf of clients andor via seed or coinvestments and to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms could make it more difficult for blackrock to conduct certain business activities or distinguish itself from competitors see “item 1 – business – regulation” above for additional information regarding certain laws and regulations that affect blackrock’s business 

 

  

failure to comply with the investment advisers act of 1940 the “advisers act” and the investment company act of 1940 the “investment company act” and related regulations could result in substantial harm to blackrock’s reputation and results of operations 

certain blackrock subsidiaries are registered with the sec under the advisers act and blackrock’s us mutual funds and exchangetraded funds are registered with the sec under the investment company act the advisers act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers including recordkeeping operating and marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes similar obligations as well as additional detailed operational and compliance requirements on investment advisers to registered investment companies the failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with the advisers act or the investment company act could cause the sec to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts including censure termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to secregistered funds and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the company’s reputation any of which could cause its earnings or stock price to decline 

failure to comply with erisa regulations could result in penalties and cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

certain blackrock subsidiaries are subject to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” and to regulations promulgated thereunder insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under erisa with respect to benefit plan clients erisa and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa prohibit specified transactions involving erisa plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions the failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce the company’s earnings or cause its stock price to decline 

blackrock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities 

because the total equity ownership interest of pnc in blackrock exceeds certain thresholds blackrock is deemed to be a nonbank subsidiary of pnc which is regulated as a financial holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956 as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc blackrock is subject to banking regulation including the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve 

such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that blackrock may conduct the federal reserve has broad enforcement authority over blackrock including the power to prohibit blackrock from conducting any activity that in the federal reserve’s opinion is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations any failure of pnc to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain blackrock activities and its growth in addition blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary is subject to regulation by the occ and is subject to capital requirements established by the occ the occ has broad enforcement authority over blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary also provisions of the dfa referred to as the volcker rule could to the extent the final volcker rule is determined to apply to blackrock’s activities affect the method by which blackrock invests in and operates its investment funds including private equity funds hedge funds and fund of funds platforms being subject to banking regulation including potentially the volcker rule may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations in the united kingdom other member states of the european union hong kong japan australia and other nonus jurisdictions in which blackrock operates could result in substantial harm to blackrock’s reputation and results of operations

blackrock ended 2012 with record assets under management “aum” of 3792 trillion as clients sought efficient tools and innovative solutions to meet their investment objectives over both the short and long term the company experienced strong client demand for exchange traded funds and products “etfs” and “etps” respectively alternative and emerging market investment products highyielding income strategies outcomeoriented solutions and retirementrelated products and the company expects this demand to continue into 2013

nongaap financial measures 

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with gaap however management believes evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap basis financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators for both management and investors of blackrock’s financial performance over time blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 

computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows 

 

 operating income as adjusted equals operating income gaap basis excluding certain items management deems nonrecurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value as indicated in the table below operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and commissions operating margin as adjusted equals operating income used for operating margin measurement divided by revenue net of distribution and servicing costs and amortization of deferred sales commissions used for operating margin measurement as indicated in the table below 

 

 

   

management believes operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time and therefore provide useful disclosure to investors 

operating income as adjusted 

operating income as adjusted reflects nongaap expense adjustments bgi transaction and integration costs consisted principally of compensation expense legal fees marketing and promotional occupancy and consulting 

expenses incurred in conjunction with the bgi acquisition from barclays uk lease exit costs represent costs to exit two locations in london in the third quarter 2011 the amount in 2012 represents an adjustment related to the estimated costs initially recorded in third quarter 2011 the contribution to stifs represents a onetime contribution to certain of the company’s bankmanaged stifs see liquidity and capital resources for more information restructuring charges consist of compensation costs and professional fees 

 

  

the portion of compensation expense associated with certain longterm incentive plans “ltip” funded or to be funded through share distributions to participants of blackrock stock held by pnc and a merrill lynch  co inc “merrill lynch” cash compensation contribution has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact blackrock’s book value the expense related to the merrill lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of third quarter 2011 as of first quarter 2012 all of the merrill lynch contributions had been received 

compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans which substantially offset this expense are reported in nonoperating income expense 

management believes operating income exclusive of these items is a useful measure in evaluating blackrock’s operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented 

operating margin as adjusted 

operating income used for measuring operating margin as adjusted is equal to operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and commissions management believes the exclusion of such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the company’s results until future periods 

operating margin as adjusted allows the company to compare performance from periodtoperiod by adjusting for items that may not recur recur infrequently or may have an economic offset in nonoperating income expense examples of such adjustments include bgi transaction and integration costs uk lease exit costs contribution to stifs restructuring charges closedend fund launch costs commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctuations in compensation expense based on marktomarket movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans the company also uses operating margin as adjusted to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies management uses both the gaap and nongaap financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of blackrock the nongaap measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the company’s revenues and expenses 

revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services which due to the terms of the contracts are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time substantially offset distribution fee revenue earned by the company for each of these items blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues 

 

 nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted is presented below the compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income this compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans which are reported in nonoperating income expense gaap basis 

 

  

 management believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides comparability of this information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock’s nonoperating contribution to its results as compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans which is included in operating income substantially offsets the gain loss on the investments set aside for these plans management 

 

  

believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides a useful measure for both management and investors of blackrock’s nonoperating results that impact book value 

 

 management believes net income attributable to blackrock as adjusted and diluted earnings per common 

share as adjusted are useful measures of blackrock’s profitability and financial performance net income attributable to blackrock as adjusted equals net income attributable to blackrock gaap basis adjusted for significant nonrecurring items charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow 

 

 

 see note a operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted for information on bgi transactionintegration costs uk lease exit costs contribution to stifs restructuring charges pnc ltip funding obligation and merrill lynch compensation contribution 

during 2012 income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation enacted in the united kingdom and the state and local income tax effect resulting from changes in the company’s organizational structure during 2011 and 2010 income tax changes included adjustments related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to a state tax election and enacted uk japan us state and local tax legislation the resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted as these items do not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented

the following table presents the component changes in blackrock’s aum for 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

  

      blackrock has historically grown aggregate aum through organic growth and acquisitions management believes that the company will be able to continue to grow aum by focusing on strong investment performance the efficient delivery of beta for index products client service by developing new products and new distribution capabilities and by continuing appropriate acquisitions 

the following table presents the component changes in blackrock’s aum for 2012 

 

   

 

       

aum increased 2789 billion or 8 to 3792 trillion at december 31 2012 from 3513 trillion at december 31 2011 the increase in aum was driven largely by market gains and positive net new business excluding the effect of two single client lowfee institutional index fixed income outflows of 360 billion and 742 billion in first quarter 2012 and third quarter 2012 respectively total flows included 745 billion of planned advisory distributions and acquired aum related to the srpep and the claymore transactions of 137 billion 

net market appreciation of 3214 billion reflected growth in us and global equity markets and 678 billion appreciation in fixed income products across the majority of strategies 

the 157 billion net increase in aum from converting nonus dollar denominated aum into us dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the pound sterling and the euro partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen 

 

 

the following table presents the component changes in blackrock’s aum for 2011 

 

  

       

aum decreased approximately 483 billion or 1 to 3513 trillion at december 31 2011 from 3561 trillion at december 31 2010 the decline in aum was primarily attributable to 346 billion in net market and foreign exchange valuation declines 299 billion of advisory distributions and 229 billion of cash management net outflows partially offset by 673 billion of longterm net new business before giving effect to the final bgi mergerrelated outflows of 283 billion recorded in the first half of 2011 

net market depreciation of 275 billion included 1281 billion of depreciation in equity products resulting from the decline in global equity partially offset by appreciation in fixed income products of 1007 billion 

the 71 billion net decrease in aum from converting nonus dollar denominated aum into us dollars was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro pound sterling and canadian dollar partially offset by weakening of the us dollar against the japanese yen

shortterm investment funds barclays has provided capital support agreements to support certain cash management funds acquired by blackrock in the bgi transaction pursuant to the terms of the capital support agreements barclays agreed to cover losses on covered securities within the products in the aggregate of up to 22 billion from december 1 2009 through december 1 2013 or until certain criteria were met blackrock and barclays have procedures in place to determine loss events on covered securities within the products and to ensure support payments from barclays on october 9 2012 blackrock on behalf of two of these funds negotiated amendments to these capital support agreements to release barclays from coverage provided for defaults on 51 covered securities with an estimated value of approximately 750 million held in the funds in exchange for a payment by barclays to the funds of 70 million the payment was in an amount in excess of the payments that were expected under the barclays capital support agreements the barclays capital support agreements continued in effect for the remaining covered securities in these two funds and after this transaction at october 10 2012 barclays’ remaining potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was 16 billion the support agreements for these two funds had a termination date of december 1 2013 subject to an early termination option in the event that the applicable fund’s market value remained above a certain net asset value per unit for 120 consecutive days barclays exercised its termination option for these two funds on december 7 2012 and january 3 2013 after these terminations at january 31 2013 barclays’ remaining maximum potential obligation in the aggregate under the capital support agreements was not material 

as previously mentioned the fourth quarter 2012 results included a onetime 30 million charge related to a contribution to certain of these stifs this contribution resulted from actions taken to ensure compliance with new regulations from the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” taking effect in july 2013 that further limit a stif’s weightedaverage portfolio life maturity blackrock chose to sell certain securities held within stifs and to make a onetime contribution to the stifs to maintain the value of the funds while ensuring compliance with the new occ rules the securities sold were held in funds managed by bgi prior to blackrock’s 

 

  

acquisition of bgi until adoption of the new stif regulations blackrock had been pursuing a strategy to hold these securities as market values improved over time as a result of the fourth quarter security sales these stifs are currently in compliance with the new occ rules 

at december 31 2012 blackrock concluded that although these funds were vies it was not the primary beneficiary “pb” of these funds 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k 

consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products  consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products collectively “investment products” is determined pursuant to asc 810 consolidation  the accounting method used by the company depends upon the influence the company has over its investee the investment product to the extent that blackrock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product which generally exists if there is a 50 or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights blackrock consolidates the investment product 

for investment products in which blackrock’s voting interest is less than 50 an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a vie or a voting rights entity upon the determination that the investment product is a vie further analysis as discussed below is performed to determine if blackrock is the pb of the investment product which would require consolidation 

consolidation of variable interest entities  certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of 

ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed vies blackrock reviews factors including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns to determine if the investment product is a vie blackrock is required to consolidate a vie when it is deemed to be the pb which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change 

accounting standards update “asu” 201010 amendments to statement 167 for certain investment funds “asu 201010” defers the application of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r for certain investment funds including money market funds the pb of a vie that meets the conditions of asu 201010 is the enterprise that has a variable interest or combination of variable interests including those of related parties that absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both effective january 1 2010 the pb of a vie that does not meet the conditions for deferral in asu 201010 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie 

significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the company is the pb of a vie if the company is determined to be the pb of a vie blackrock will consolidate the entity in order to determine whether the company is the pb of a vie for entities that meet the conditions of asu 201010 management must make significant estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios assumptions made in such analyses include but are not limited to market prices of securities market interest rates potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities gain realization liquidity or marketability of certain securities discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes 

in the normal course of business the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles including collateralized debt obligations “cdos” or clos that do not meet the conditions of asu 201010 and sponsored investment funds which may be considered vies 

 

  

at december 31 2012 the following balances related to consolidated vies including clos and an investment fund on the consolidated statements of financial condition 

 

   

at december 31 2012 blackrock was the manager of over 20 closcdos and other securitization entities in accordance with consolidation accounting guidance for vies blackrock was determined to be the pb for certain of these clos which required blackrock to consolidate these vies blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities of the clo that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie at december 31 2012 the company had 2534 million and 2505 million in assets and liabilities respectively on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated clos in addition the company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities as the clo noteholders not blackrock ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the clo’s assets and liabilities the changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of these clos have no impact on net income attributable to blackrock or its cash flows excluding outstanding management fee receivables the company has no risk of loss with its involvement with these vies 

at december 31 2012 blackrock was determined to be the pb of one sponsored private equity investment fund of funds in which it had a nonsubstantive investment and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its defacto thirdparty relationships with other partners in the fund which limits the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without blackrock’s consent as the general partner of the fund at december 31 2012 the company had recorded 3 million 

24 million and 27 million in cash and cash equivalents private equity investments and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests of consolidated vies respectively on the consolidated statement of financial condition related to this vie the changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of this vie have no impact on net income attributable to blackrock excluding outstanding management fee receivables the company has no risk of loss with its involvement with this vie 

consolidation of voting rights entities  to the extent that blackrock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which generally exists if there is a 50 or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights blackrock consolidates the investee 

the company as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies pursuant to asc 81020 control of partnerships and similar entities “asc 81020” the company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining whether other nonaffiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the investment vehicle or otherwise to remove blackrock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote or have other substantive participating rights if the investment vehicle is not a vie and the presumption of control is not overcome blackrock will consolidate the investment vehicle 

 

  

at december 31 2012 and 2011 as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities including products where blackrock owns 50 of greater of the voting rights of the product under the consolidation policies described above the company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition 

 

 the company retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to asc 81010 vies including a consolidated sponsored investment fund and clos were excluded from the balances above as these balances are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition 

investments 

equity method investments  for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where it is not the pb of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company follows the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity 

substantially all of blackrock’s equity method investees are investment companies that record their underlying investments at fair value therefore under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value 

adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income expense for investments in investment companies or as other revenue for operating advisory company investments which are recorded in other assets since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock’s core business 

at december 31 2012 the company had 604 million and 124 million of equity method investments including equity method investments held for deferred compensation reflected within investments and other assets respectively and at december 31 2011 the company had 476 million and 80 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets respectively 

impairment of investment s the company’s management periodically assesses its equity method availableforsale heldtomaturity and cost investments for impairment if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist investments are evaluated using market values where available or the expected future cash flows of the investment if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the company’s carrying value of the investment an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income 

when the fair value of availableforsale securities is lower than cost the company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered to be “otherthantemporary” 

in making this determination for equity securities the company considers among other factors the length of time the security has been in a loss position the extent to which the security’s market value is less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses if the impairment is considered otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income expense on the consolidated statement of income 

in making this determination for debt securities the company considers whether 1 it has the intent to sell the security 2 it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery or 3 it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security if the company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered a credit loss the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total 

 

  

impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 

fair value measurements 

hierarchy of fair value inputs  the provisions of asc 82010 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and require companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 

assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories 

level 1 inputs 

quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date 

 

 level 2 inputs 

quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active quotes from pricing services or brokers for which the company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as models or other valuation methodologies as a practical expedient the company relies on the nav or its equivalent of certain investments as their fair value 

 



 level 3 inputs 

unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability which may include nonbinding broker quotes level 3 assets include investments for which there is little if any market activity these inputs require significant management judgment or estimation certain investments that are valued using nav or its equivalent and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in level 3 

 

  

  

 significance of inputs  the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument 

valuation techniques  the fair values of certain level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various methodologies as appropriate including navs of underlying investments thirdparty pricing vendors broker quotes and market and income approaches such quotes and modeled prices are evaluated for reasonableness through various procedures including due diligence reviews of thirdparty pricing vendors variance analyses consideration of current market environment and other analytical procedures 

 

  

as a practical expedient the company relies on nav as the fair value for certain investments the inputs to value these investments may include blackrock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments including distressed credit hedge funds real estate and private equity funds which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices the various partnerships are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricingvaluation information including independent appraisals from thirdparty sources however in some instances current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any thirdparty source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from thirdparty sources are not reliable in these instances fund management may perform modelbased analytical valuations that may be used as an input to value these investments 

a significant amount of inputs used to value equity debt securities and bank loans is sourced from wellrecognized thirdparty pricing vendors generally prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price annually blackrock’s internal valuation committee or other designated groups review both the valuation methodology including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes and operational process with these vendors in addition on a quarterly basis meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ processes 

in addition quotes obtained from brokers generally are nonbinding and categorized as level 3 inputs however if the company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable the quote is classified as a level 2 input 

changes in valuation  changes in value on 1275 million of investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense 158 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income 232 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 85 million relates to carried interest which will not impact nonoperating income expense as of december 31 2012 changes in fair value of approximately 524 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact blackrock’s net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests expense on the 

consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was 430 million 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary open and closedend investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinitelived intangible assets the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost in addition trade namestrademarks are considered indefinitelived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with the applicable provisions of asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other “asc 350” indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2012 ranged from 1 to 12 years with a weightedaverage remaining estimated useful life of 49 years 

goodwill  the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment test performed as of july 31 2012 indicated that no impairment charge was required the company continuously monitors its book value per share as compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2012 the company’s common stock closed at 20671 which exceeded its book value per share of approximately 14820 after excluding appropriated retained earnings 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles  the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and whether the indefinitelife and finitelife classifications are still appropriate in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is less than its carrying value blackrock assesses various significant factors including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates in addition the company considers other factors including i macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign 

 

  

exchange rates or other developments in equity and credit markets ii industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates an increased competitive environment a decline in marketdependent multiples or metrics a change in the market for an entity’s services or regulatory legal or political developments and iii entityspecific events such as a change in management or key personnel overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs 

if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform an impairment test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion if the asset is determined to be impaired the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 157 million 156 million and 160 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

in 2012 2011 and 2010 the company performed impairment tests that indicated no impairment charges were required the classification of indefinitelived versus finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles were required the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by asc 740 income taxes “asc 740” deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax 

outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes that require significant management judgment actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2012 blackrock had 404 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 250 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

in accordance with asc 740 management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2012 the company had deferred tax assets of 4 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately 5293 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company asc 740 requires the company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

at december 31 2012 the company had recorded a deferred tax asset of 71 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the company expects to hold certain equity method investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized however changes in circumstance could cause the company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change such changes may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements see note 19 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for further details 

 

  

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately 102 million and current income taxes payables of 121 million at december 31 2012 

revenue recognition investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or in the case of certain real estate clients net operating income generated by the underlying properties investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers 

the company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the company manages such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund in certain cases the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the company bears no credit risk to the third party the company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with asc 60545 revenue recognition – principle agent considerations “asc 60545” and records its management fees net of retrocessions retrocessions for 2012 2011 and 2010 were 793 million 928 million and 831 million respectively the company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which due to the terms of the contracts are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income 

the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients primarily to brokerage institutions such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis the securities loaned are secured by collateral generally ranging from 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or other thirdparty accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed for 2012 2011 and 2010 securities lending revenue totaled 510 million 397 million and 325 million respectively and is recorded in investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee 

the company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocation from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts these performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative andor absolute investment return thresholds such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which varies by product or account and could be monthly quarterly annually or longer for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 performance fee revenue totaled 463 million 371 million and 540 million respectively in addition the company receives carried interest from certain alternative investments upon exceeding performance thresholds blackrock may be required to return all or part of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these funds therefore blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable the company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2012 and 2011 the company had 97 million and 33 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition the ultimate recognition of performance fee revenue if any for these products is unknown 

fees earned for blackrock solutions  which include advisory services are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some or all of the following methods i percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform ii fixed fees and iii performance fees if contractual thresholds are met revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of onetime advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on aum of the respective portfolio assignment for 2012 2011 and 2010 blackrock solutions and advisory revenue totaled 518 million 510 million and 460 million respectively 

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of aum and since the company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable

corporate investments portfolio risks as a leading investment management firm blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying measuring monitoring managing and analyzing market and operating risks including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio the board of directors of the company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the company requiring among other things that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the company and that certain investments may be referred to the audit committee or the board of directors depending on the circumstances for approval 

in the normal course of its business blackrock is exposed to equity market price risk interest ratecredit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments 

blackrock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate private equity and hedge funds investments generally are made for coinvestment purposes to establish a performance track record to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes currently the company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge market exposure to certain investments at december 31 2012 the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately 206 million 

 

 

at december 31 2012 approximately 524 million of blackrock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by blackrock in accordance with gaap and therefore are consolidated even though blackrock may not own a majority of such funds excluding the impact of the federal reserve bank stock carried interest investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program the company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows 

 

   

the “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the equity market price or the interest ratecredit spread risk disclosures below 

equity market price risk at december 31 2012 the company’s net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately 609 million of the company’s total economic investment exposure investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds the company estimates that a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately 609 million in the carrying value of such investments 

interest ratecredit spread risk at december 31 2012 the company was exposed to interestrate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately 602 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments in the aggregate would result in a decrease or increase of approximately 80 million in the carrying value of such investments 

foreign exchange rate risk as discussed above the company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes the carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies primarily the pound sterling and euro was 156 million at december 31 2012 a 10 adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a 156 million decline in the carrying value of such investments 

other market risks by using derivative financial instruments the company exposes itself to market risk market risk from forward foreign currency exchange contracts is the effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in currency exchange rates the company manages exposure to 

market risk associated with foreign currency exchange contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degrees of market risk that may be undertaken at december 31 2012 the company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately 79 million

selected financial results for the last six years are shown below 

 

  

  see additional information in item 6 selected financial data 

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” however management believes that evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced by also evaluating additional nongaap basis financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators for both management and investors of blackrock’s financial performance over time blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 

operating income  as adjusted  gaap reported operating income includes certain significant items the aftertax impact of which management considers nonrecurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value and therefore are excluded in calculating operating income as adjusted 

operating income as adjusted a nongaap measure excludes certain expenses incurred related to the integration of the acquisitions of merrill lynch investment managers “mlim” the fund of funds business of quellos group llc “quellos” and bgi as well as advisory fees legal fees and consulting transaction expenses related to the acquisition of bgi from barclays on december 1 2009 the “bgi transaction” a 2007 termination fee for closedend fund administration and servicing arrangements with merrill lynch 2011 uk lease exit costs 2008 2009 and 2011 restructuring charges and compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on assets related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans these expenses have been excluded from operating income as adjusted because they have been deemed nonrecurring by management and to help enhance the comparability of this information to prior periods 

the portion of compensation expense associated with certain of blackrock’s longterm incentive plan “ltip” awards that has been or will be funded through distributions to participants of shares of blackrock stock held by pnc and a merrill lynch cash compensation contribution a portion of which has been received has been excluded because exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of ltip participants’ put options primarily in the three months ended march 31 2007 these charges do not impact blackrock’s book value the expense related to the merrill lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of the third quarter 2011 a detailed discussion of the ltip funded by pnc is included in note 13 stockbased compensation to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k 

  

   

overview continued 

  

operating income as adjusted continued  compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans which substantially offset this expense are reported in nonoperating income expense 

management believes that operating income exclusive of these costs is a useful measure in evaluating blackrock’s operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented 

operating margin as adjusted operating income used for measuring operating margin as adjusted is equal to operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and commissions management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the company’s results until future periods 

operating margin as adjusted allows the company to compare performance from periodtoperiod by adjusting for items that may not recur recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements such as restructuring charges transactionintegration costs uk lease exit costs closedend fund launch costs and fluctuations in compensation expense based on marktomarket movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans the company also uses operating margin as adjusted to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies management uses both the gaap and nongaap financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of blackrock the nongaap measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all the company’s revenues and expenses 

revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful to blackrock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services which due to the terms of the contracts are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time substantially offset distribution fee revenue earned by the company reimbursable property management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of metric property management inc “metric” a subsidiary of blackrock realty advisors inc “realty” prior to the transfer in 2008 to a third party these employees were retained on metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by realty’s clients the related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted because they did not bear an economic cost to blackrock blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues 

nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests as adjusted nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests “nci” as adjusted equals nonoperating income expense gaap basis less net income loss attributable to nci gaap basis adjusted for compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans the compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income this compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans which are reported in nonoperating income expense gaap basis 

management believes that nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides for comparability of this information to reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock’s nonoperating contribution to its results as compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans which is included in operating income offsets the gain loss on the investments set aside for these plans management believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides a useful measure for both management and investors of blackrock’s nonoperating results that impact book value

net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted management believes net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted and diluted earnings per common share as adjusted are useful measures of blackrock’s profitability and financial performance net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted equals net income attributable to blackrock inc gaap basis adjusted for significant nonrecurring items charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow 

net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted and diluted earnings per common share as adjusted nongaap measures exclude the aftertax impact of the 2008 2009 and 2011 restructuring charges uk lease exit costs the 2007 termination of closedend fund administration and servicing arrangements with merrill lynch ltip expense to be funded by pnc and by a merrill lynch cash compensation contribution a portion of which has been received the mlim quellos and bgi integration costs bgi transaction costs the effect on deferred income tax expense attributable to changes in corporate income tax rates as a result of legislation and a state tax election

overview continued 

  

aum represents the broad ranges of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months in general reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing for example net asset value reported aum does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice or assets that we are retained to manage on a shortterm temporary basis for example in a transition mandate as described below 

investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of net asset value we also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreedupon benchmark or return hurdle on some products we also may earn securities lending fees in addition blackrock offers its proprietary aladdin ® investment system as well as risk management outsourcing and advisory services to institutional investors under the brs name revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions number of users accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives 

at december 31 2011 total aum was 3513 trillion representing a compound annual growth rate of 26 over the last five years aum growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains net new business and mergers including the acquisitions of the fundoffunds business of quellos which added approximately 219 billion of assets in 2007 and bgi which added approximately 1844 trillion of assets in december 2009 these acquisitions significantly changed our aum mix from predominantly active fixed income and equity in 2005 to a broadly diversified product range as described below

 at yearend 2011 longterm assets totaled 3138 trillion or 89 of total aum with 50 in equities 40 in fixed income 7 in multiasset class and 3 in alternative investments the remaining 3747 billion of aum represented cash management and longterm liquidation advisory mandates in 2011 we generated 673 billion of net new business in longterm products before 283 billion of bgi mergerrelated outflows see below net inflows in longterm products were partially offset by 229 billion of net outflows in cash management largely reflecting institutional reaction to the continued low rate environment and 299 billion of planned net distributions from advisory portfolios 

unless stated otherwise net new business figures are before giving effect to bgi mergerrelated outflows total mergerrelated outflows since the bgi transaction represented less than 9 of the acquired aum

equity and fixed income total equity and fixed income aum reflects the diversity of our model and includes a wide range of both active and passive strategies including our institutional index and ishares products yearend 2011 equity aum of 1560 trillion decreased 1344 billion or 8 from the end of 2010 largely reflecting the effect of lower market valuations net new business of 241 billion was more than offset by 1309 billion of market valuation and foreign exchange losses passive strategies represented 82 of equity aum with the remaining 18 managed in active mandates fixed income aum ended 2011 at 1248 trillion rising 1064 billion or 9 relative to december 31 2010 reflecting 43 billion of net new business and 1026 billion of market valuation and foreign exchange gains fixed income aum was almost evenly split between passive and active mandates with 51 and 49 respectively bgi mergerrelated outflows totaled 276 billion and 05 billion in equities and fixed income respectively primarily reflecting the effect of manager concentration considerations combined with outflows in scientific active equities “sae” due to past performance see additional discussion under “aum by investment style” below 

investment advisory and administration fees for the majority of our investment products are calculated using daily or monthly average aum during periods of significant market volatility quarterly average aum may differ from actual average aum used for billing purposes for example for the fourth quarter of 2011 equity market volatility caused the quarterly and monthly averages to differ by more than 2 for equities specifically quarterly average aum for active index and ishares equities was 271 billion 828 billion and 402 billion while monthly average aum was 280 billion 851 billion and 415 billion respectively 

in addition blackrock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix approximately 50 of blackrock’s equity aum is tied to international markets including emerging markets which tend to have higher fee rates than similar us equity strategies accordingly fluctuations in international equity markets which do not consistently move in tandem with us markets may have a greater impact on blackrock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues 

multiasset class 

component changes in multiasset class aum 

 

 multiasset class aum totaled 2252 billion at yearend 2011 up 21 or 396 billion during the year we were awarded 427 billion of net new business while portfolio values declined by 31 billion blackrock’s multiasset class team manages a variety of bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverage our broad investment expertise in global equities currencies bonds and commodities and our extensive risk management capabilities investment solutions might include a combination of longonly portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays 

at december 31 2011 institutional investors represented 63 of multiasset class aum while retail and high net worth investors accounted for 37 at yearend 2011 55 of multiasset class aum was managed for clients based in the americas 38 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” and 7 in asiapacific flows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our advice in an increasingly challenging investment environment with 357 billion or 84 of net new inflows from institutional clients and 67 billion or 16 from retail investors during the year clients in the americas and emea awarded blackrock net new business of 442 billion which was partially offset by net outflows of 15 billion from clients in asiapacific

 market volatility particularly in the latter half of 2011 presented challenges for asset allocation strategies our multiasset class performance has been mixed with 65 of aum above benchmark or peer medians for the oneyear period while 26 of aum performed above benchmark or peer medians for the threeyear time period and 91 of aum outperformed benchmark or peer medians for the five years ended december 31 2011 

alternatives 

component changes in alternatives aum 

 

  

 alternatives totaled 1049 billion at yearend 2011 down 48 billion largely due to net outflows of 38 billion net inflows of 24 billion into singlestrategy hedge funds were largely offset by outflows from other core alternatives products commodities net inflows of 18 billion were offset by net outflows of 56 billion from active and passive currency strategies net market valuation declines of 09 billion also dampened results we continued to make significant investments in our alternatives platform in 2011 including the addition of three new hedge funds a suite of new alternatives mutual funds and direct private equity as well as the formation of a strategic relationship with ntr plc to launch renewable power products we believe that as alternatives become more mainstream and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies to best meet their investment objectives they will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings with highlyregarded alternative investment experts armed with industryleading access to information insights and deal flow and a multifaceted risk management process blackrock is well positioned to capitalize on this trend and has been recognized for achievements in the alternatives space 

institutional investors represented 73 or 765 billion of alternatives aum with retail and high net worth investors comprising an additional 9 or 91 billion at december 31 2011 ishares commodities products represented the remaining 193 billion or 18 of aum at year end the geographic mix was well diversified with 56 of aum managed for clients in the americas 22 for clients in emea and 22 for clients in asiapacific 

the blackrock alternative investors “bai” group coordinates our alternative investment efforts including product management business development and client service our alternatives products fall into two main categories – core which includes hedge funds funds of funds and real estate offerings and currency and commodities the products offered under the bai umbrella are described below

 currency and commodities 

aum in currency and commodities strategies totaled 413 billion at yearend 2011 down 48 billion during the year reflecting 38 billion of net outflows primarily in active currency and currency overlays and 10 billion of market valuation declines these products include a range of active and passive products primarily managed through institutional separate accounts our ishares commodities products represented 192 billion of aum and are not eligible for performance fees 

cash management and securities lending cash management aum totaled 2547 billion at december 31 2011 down 245 billion or 9 from yearend 2010 cash management products include taxable and taxexempt money market funds and customized separate accounts portfolios may be denominated in us dollar euro or british pound 

at yearend 2011 84 of cash aum was managed for institutions and 16 for retail and high net worth investors the investor base was also predominantly domestic with 70 of aum managed for investors in the americas and 30 for clients in other regions mostly emeabased we suffered net outflows during the year as investors sought higher yields in bank deposits direct money market investments and longerterm assets among institutional investors we saw the movement of unprecedented levels of cash to us domiciled bank accounts partially due to the unlimited guarantee from the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” on bank deposits additionally retail investors looked to different asset classes in search of higher yields as cash rates remained low we expect flows in cash management to remain volatile due to continued global market uncertainty persistent low interest rates and potential regulatory changes 

the cash management team also invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios securities lending which is offered as a potential source of incremental returns on longterm portfolios is managed by a dedicated team supported by quantitative analysis proprietary technology and disciplined risk management fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings andor a percentage of the value of the cash collateral the value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the corresponding asset class being managed the value of the collateral is not included in aum 

outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately 120 billion up from 104 billion at yearend 2010 the majority of the increase occurred during the second quarter with balances remaining relatively stable through the remainder of the year demand generally strengthened in the latter part of the year as equity market volatility rose in response to the european debt crisis the strong rally in december raised notional values on loans and offset any decline in enduser borrowing due to falling volatility the proportion of securities commanding premium lending fees grew slowly through the year and started 2012 above the 2011 average 

blackrock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality liquidity and superior client service through all market cycles disciplined risk management including a rigorous credit surveillance process is an integral part of the investment process blackrock’s cash management risk committee has established risk limits such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits across many of the products blackrock manages including over all of its cash management products in the ordinary course of our business there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed no such instances individually or in the aggregate have been material to the company to the extent that daily evaluationreporting of the profile of the portfolios identifies that a limit has been exceeded the relevant portfolio will be adjusted to the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers while a risk limit may be waived such temporary waivers are infrequent

 component changes in longterm aum by style 

 

  

 

 longterm 1 product offerings include active and passive index strategies our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle alpha while maintaining an appropriate risk profile in contrast passive strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index beta generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index 

although many clients use both active and passive strategies the application of these strategies differs greatly for example clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class pending reallocation to an active manager this has the effect of increasing turnover of index aum in addition institutional index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and typically reflect low fee rates this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index on blackrock’s revenues and earnings

at yearend ishares aum included 4197 billion or 71 in equity offerings 1538 billion or 26 in fixed income etps and 199 billion or 3 in multiasset class and alternative investments ishares equity aum decreased 285 billion or 6 from yearend 2010 with 246 billion in net inflows more than offset by 531 billion of market and foreign exchange losses ishares fixed income aum rose 307 billion or 25 over the previous year with 88 of the increase being driven by 269 billion of net inflows ishares multiasset class and alternatives aum grew by 09 billion or 5 with 15 billion of net inflows predominantly in commodity products such as gold and silver offset by 06 billion of market and foreign exchange declines

 in addition we were the largest etp manager in latin america with over 80 of aum at december 31 2011 3  we continue to look for opportunities to further diversify product offerings in key strategic focus areas including attractive highgrowth markets as demonstrated by the july 2011 launch of ishares colcap the first etp in the colombian market and by our january 2012 announced acquisition of the canadian etp provider claymore investments in general we expect to maintain relatively stable pricing so long as it is supported by performance and the ishares value proposition although we continually seek to achieve efficiencies and pass them on to our clients 

blackrock solutions blackrock solutions offers investment management technology systems risk management services and advisory services on a fee basis in 2011 approximately 102 trillion of positions were processed on our aladdin proprietary technology platform which serves as the investment system for both blackrock and a growing number of sophisticated institutional investors around the world brs also offers comprehensive risk reporting capabilities via the green package ® and risk management advisory services interactive fixed income analytics through our webbased calculator anser ®  middle and back office outsourcing services and investment accounting brs’ financial markets advisory “fma” group provides services for a wide range of global clients such as valuation and risk assessment of illiquid assets portfolio restructuring workouts and dispositions of distressed assets and financial and balance sheet strategies

in fma the growing financial crisis in europe led to several shortterm risk analytics assignments including a few highprofile engagements overall the nature of fma assignments is shifting to longerterm advisory and risk monitoring engagements advisory aum decreased 20 to 1201 billion driven by 299 billion of planned client distributions reflecting our continued success in disposing of assets for clients at or above targeted levels 

the brs and aladdin teams continued to support key aspects of the bgi integration in 2011 these efforts are vital to establishing a unified operating platform and consistent operating processes we expect the integration of bgi’s extensive quantitative tools risk management models and portfolio construction applications across asset classes to enhance the aladdin platform over time additionally we will seek to leverage our scale for the benefit of our clients through the creation of a robust global trading platform in order to improve execution and enhance alpha as well as other initiatives

 americas at yearend 2011 assets managed on behalf of clients domiciled in the americas defined as the us caribbean canada latin america and iberia totaled 2123 trillion or 60 of total aum down 540 billion or 2 since yearend 2010 net new business in longterm products of 547 billion was insufficient to overcome outflows of 694 billion from cash and advisory and 292 billion in market valuation losses during the year we served clients through offices in 30 states in the united states as well as canada mexico brazil chile and spain 

product offerings included closedend funds and ishares traded on various local stock exchanges a full range of openend mutual funds collective investment funds common trusts private funds and separate accounts our longterm product mix is well diversified and proportional to the firm’s mix with 53 in equities 37 in fixed income 7 in multiasset class and 3 in alternatives cash management products predominantly serve clients in the americas we also have a wide variety of brs assignments for institutional investors and governmental entities in the united states and canada 

  

   

clients overview 

  

the mix by investment style is also balanced with 39 of longterm aum managed in active products 35 in institutional index accounts and 26 in ishares at yearend note that the ishares figures are based on the jurisdiction of the product rather than the underlying investor nonus investors often prefer us ishares  primarily due to the depth of the markets and liquidity of the products 

emea aum for clients based in emea ended the year at 1027 trillion or 29 of total aum an increase of 111 billion from yearend 2010 during the year clients awarded us net new business of 235 billion including inflows from investors in 19 countries across the region our offerings include fund families in the uk luxembourg and dublin and ishares listed on stock exchanges throughout europe as well as separate accounts and pooled investment products 

clients invested across the entire product spectrum with 46 of longterm aum in equities 43 in fixed income 9 in multiasset class and 2 in alternatives emea clients constitute 30 of our cash management products and represent 11 of our advisory aum brs has steadily built its presence in emea with aladdin relationships with a variety of institutional investors and fma engagements for financial services companies and official institutions including assignments for the central bank of ireland and the national bank of greece 

the mix by investment style is slightly more concentrated than in the americas with 36 invested in active products 53 in institutional index accounts and 11 in ishares  the relatively higher percentage in institutional index is driven by lowfee institutional liability hedging portfolios which account for approximately 20 of total institutional index assets the relatively lower percentage in ishares primarily reflects the earlier stage of development of the european etp market and our lower installed share 

asiapacific clients in the asiapacific region are served through offices in japan australia hong kong singapore taiwan and korea and joint ventures in china and india at december 31 2011 we managed 3623 billion of aum for clients in the region a decrease of 1 or 53 billion from yearend 2010 net new business of 57 billion was offset by 23 billion of unfavorable market movements and 87 billion of bgi mergerrelated outflows 

at yearend the mix of longterm products managed for these clients consisted of 43 equities 47 fixed income 4 multiasset class and 6 alternative investments asiapacific clients represented 2 of our advisory aum and less than 1 of our cash management products brs serves a select number of the largest and most sophisticated investors in the region we continue to grow our presence in the region with the addition of our first two multiasset aladdin assignments in japan 

the mix among investment styles was tilted more toward institutional index accounts than in the other regions with 2210 billion or 62 of longterm aum in these products this bias can be traced to the presence of very large governmental institutions and pensions that are heavy users of index products asiapacific institutional investors also use ishares for tactical allocation but often favor the liquidity of the us products which are counted in americas ishares  active mandates represented 36 of aum managed for investors in the region at yearend

competition blackrock competes with investment management firms mutual fund complexes insurance companies banks brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to or alternatives to those offered by blackrock in order to grow its business blackrock must be able to compete effectively for aum key competitive factors include investment performance track records the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products investment style and discipline client service and brand name recognition historically the company has competed principally on the basis of its longterm investment performance track record its investment process its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service these factors may place blackrock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing aum and to attract new business will be successful

regulation 

virtually all aspects of blackrock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations both in and outside the united states some of which are summarized below these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients investors in registered and unregistered investment companies trust customers of blackrock institutional trust company na “btc” pnc and its bank subsidiaries and their customers and the financial system under these laws and regulations agencies that regulate investment advisers investment funds and financial and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries such as blackrock and its subsidiaries have broad administrative powers including the power to limit restrict or prohibit the regulated entity from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time revocation of investment adviser and other registrations censures and fines the rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical accordingly the discussion below is general in nature does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report 

regulatory reform 

on july 21 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “dfa” was signed into law in the united states the dfa is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be implemented the adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the dfa on blackrock and other financial services firms the dfa may significantly change blackrock’s operating environment and the financial markets in general in unpredictable ways it is not possible to predict the ultimate effects that the dfa or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions will have upon blackrock’s business and results of operations among the potential impacts of the dfa provisions of the dfa referred to as the volcker rule could to the extent the final volcker rule is determined to apply to blackrock’s activities affect the method by which blackrock invests in and operates its investment funds including private equity funds hedge funds and fund of funds platforms the impact of the volcker rule on liquidity and pricing in the broader financial markets is unknown at this time in addition blackrock could become designated as a systemically important financial institution “sifi” and become subject to direct supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” if blackrock were designated a sifi it could be subject to enhanced prudential supervisory and other requirements such as riskbased capital requirements leverage limits liquidity requirements resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements concentration limits a contingent capital requirement enhanced public disclosures shortterm debt limits and overall risk management requirements further proposed regulations under the dfa relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner by which blackrock and blackrockadvised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives and could significantly increase the costs of derivatives trading similarly blackrock’s management of funds and accounts that use and trade swaps and derivatives could be adversely impacted by recently adopted changes to the commodity futures trading commission’s the “cftc” regulations these include changes imposing limits on speculative positions in contracts on certain physical commodities which could adversely affect liquidity in the futures and swaps markets in which blackrock trades for its funds and accounts and could expose blackrock to heightened compliance costs other jurisdictions outside the united states in which blackrock operates are also in the process of devising or considering more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could have a similar impact on blackrock and the broader markets 

  

   

regulation continued 

  

the dfa and its regulations and other new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities require blackrock to change certain business practices divert management’s time and attention from blackrock’s business activities to compliance activities and expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and tax costs and liabilities as well as reputational harm for example in addition to regulatory changes mandated by the dfa the securities and exchange commission the “sec” adopted regulations related to and continues to review the role and risks related to money market funds and has indicated that it may adopt additional regulations some of the proposed changes if adopted could significantly alter money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry similarly the sec continues to review the distribution fees paid to mutual fund distributors in accordance with rule 12b1 under the investment company act of 1940 as amended the “investment company act” which are important to a number of the mutual funds blackrock manages any changes to 12b1 fees would alter the way blackrock’s distribution partners distribute blackrock products additionally the sec the internal revenue service “irs” and the cftc each continue to review the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds and such reviews could result in regulations that further limit the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds if adopted these limitations could require blackrock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the cftc another example of new regulation is the sec’s recently adopted systemic risk reporting requirement pursuant to which blackrock will be required to file sec form pf beginning in 2012 in addition the cftc also adopted systemic reporting requirements which may impose significant reporting obligations on blackrock still another example of changes in the regulatory landscape is regulations to be adopted by the irs under the foreign account tax compliance act “fatca” fatca was enacted in 2010 and is intended to address tax compliance issues associated with us taxpayers with foreign accounts fatca requires foreign financial institutions to report to the irs information about financial accounts held by us taxpayers and imposes withholding documentation and reporting requirements on foreign financial institutions final regulations are expected to be adopted by the irs in 2012 with the earliest implementation dates beginning in 2013 such regulations could cause the company to incur significant administrative and compliance costs in addition globally regulators are examining the potential risks in etfs and may impose additional regulations on etfs including requirements to promote increased transparency and to limit the ability of etfs to utilize derivatives any of these regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions could materially and adversely impact the value of assets in which blackrock has invested directly andor on behalf of clients and to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms could make it more difficult for blackrock to conduct certain businesses or distinguish itself from competitors 

additional legislation changes in rules promulgated by regulators and selfregulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of blackrock blackrock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce see the nonus regulation section below for a discussion of regulatory reforms being considered andor adopted outside of the united states

us banking regulation 

pnc is a bank holding company and regulated as a “financial holding company” by the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended the “bhc act” based on pnc’s interests in and relationships with blackrock blackrock is deemed to be a nonbank subsidiary of pnc and is therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve and to most banking laws regulations and orders that apply to pnc the supervision and regulation of pnc and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries its depositors the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation and the financial system as a whole rather than for the protection of stockholders creditors or clients of pnc or blackrock pnc’s relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of blackrock’s business blackrock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business 

btc is a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and is a member of the federal reserve system accordingly btc is examined and supervised by the occ and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the occ such as capital adequacy regulations governing fiduciaries conflicts of interest selfdealing and antimoney laundering laws and regulations btc is also subject to various federal reserve regulations applicable to member institutions such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of btc’s customers and not btc blackrock and its affiliates or blackrock’s stockholders 

  

   

regulation continued 

  

blackrock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a “financial holding company” under the bhc act investment management is an authorized activity but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements which in some cases are more restrictive than those blackrock faces under applicable securities laws blackrock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory administrative or other services only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations the federal reserve has broad powers to approve deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for blackrock to conduct new activities acquire or divest businesses or assets or reconfigure existing operations there are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of pnc to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with blackrock pnc and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of blackrock’s businesses 

the federal reserve has broad enforcement authority over blackrock including the power to prohibit blackrock from conducting any activity that in the federal reserve’s opinion is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting blackrock’s business the federal reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws regulations and orders the dfa strengthened the federal reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s nonbank affiliates such as blackrock 

any failure of pnc to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain blackrock activities and its growth such a change of status could be caused by any failure of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized” by any examination downgrade of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries or by any failure of one of pnc’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act in addition the dfa broadened the requirements for maintaining financial holding company status by now also requiring the holding company to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” 

nonus regulation 

blackrock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies and bodies as blackrock continues to expand its international presence a number of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems comparable to those affecting its operations in the united states 

the financial services authority the “fsa” currently regulates certain blackrock subsidiaries in the united kingdom authorization by the fsa is required to conduct any financial services related business in the united kingdom pursuant to the financial services and markets act 2000 the fsa’s rules made under that act govern a firm’s capital resources requirements senior management arrangements conduct of business interaction with clients and systems and controls breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the company’s ukregulated subsidiaries the uk government announced in 2010 that it intends to abolish the fsa and to establish three new regulatory bodies the financial policy committee of the bank of england the prudential regulation authority and the financial conduct authority in its place detailed proposals and draft legislation were published in mid2011 and it is intended that completion of the necessary primary legislation will take place by the end of 2012 with transfers of power in early 2013 pending formal implementation the fsa has introduced a shadow internal structure in anticipation of the creation of the prudential regulation authority and the financial conduct authority and the bank of england has created an interim financial policy committee 

in addition to the above the company’s ukregulated subsidiaries and other european subsidiaries and branches must comply with the paneuropean regime established by the markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” which became effective on november 1 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the european economic area “eea” as well as the capital requirements directive which delineates regulatory capital requirements mifid sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets it also includes pre and posttrade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements

the united kingdom has adopted the mifid rules into national legislation and fsa regulations as have those other european jurisdictions excluding switzerland which is not part of the eu or eea in which blackrock has a presence a review of mifid by the european commission has led to the publication of a draft amendment directive and a draft new markets in financial instruments regulation the proposals if implemented are likely to result in changes to pre and posttrade reporting obligations and an expansion of the types of instruments subject to these requirements they may affect the buying and selling of derivatives by moving most derivative trading onto regulated trading venues and may control the activities of algorithmic trading the proposals may also result in changes to conduct of business requirements including selling practices intermediary inducements and client categorization the proposals also envisage giving the european commission power to ban certain products and services a european commission proposal the european market infrastructure regulation “emir” when implemented will require the central clearing of standardized otc derivatives 

in addition the fsa is in the process of finalizing its rules following its retail distribution review these rules which come into effect on december 31 2012 will change how retail clients pay for investment advice given in respect of all retail investment products including openended and closedended funds structured products and insurancebased savings products 

in the aftermath of the financial crisis the european commission set out a detailed plan for eu financial reform outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives regulations and recommendations of which the mifid review mentioned above was part these will have direct and indirect effects on blackrock’s operations in the eea 

the eu alternative investment fund managers directive “aifmd” which became effective on july 21 2011 needs to be implemented by eu member states by july 22 2012 the aifmd will regulate managers of and service providers to alternative investment funds “aifs” domiciled within and depending on the precise circumstances outside the eu the aifmd will also regulate the marketing of all alternative investment funds inside the eea in general the aifmd is expected to have a staged implementation between mid2013 and 2018 compliance with the aifmd’s requirement may restrict aif marketing and place additional compliance obligations in the form of remuneration policies capital requirements leverage oversight valuation stakes in eu companies the domicile of custodians and liquidity management 

the european commission has also published proposals to replace the market abuse directive with a regulation on insider dealing and market manipulation and with an accompanying directive on criminal sanctions there are also ongoing plans to reform the framework to which regulated firms are subject including in relation to regulatory capital and the protection of client assets which will have a direct effect on some of blackrock’s european operations 

the next iteration of the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directive “ucits iv” was required to be adopted in the national law of each eu member state by july 1 2011 the united kingdom has adopted ucits iv requirements into national legislation and fsa regulation luxembourg and ireland have also adopted ucits iv into their national legislation however several other eu member states are still in various stages of the adoption process ucits iv introduced new requirements including a requirement on ucits funds to provide a key investor information document there are also european commission consultations in process that are intended to improve retail investor protection including ucits v which addresses among other items custodial liability 

recent proposals on packaged retail investment products “prips” are to be implemented through the strengthening of mifid standards for noninsurance prips revisions to the insurance mediation directive’s selling standard for all insurancebased prips and new investor disclosure requirements for all prips though a separate eu legislative process 

in addition in september 2011 the european commission proposed a financial transaction tax “ftt proposal” in the european union which would if approved by all 27 member states apply to all financial transactions where at least one party is established in an eu member state and either that party or another party to the transaction is a financial institution while the specific terms of the ftt proposal remain subject to negotiation any tax on securities transactions would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the derivatives and securities markets in europe and would adversely impact our european clients’ assets and our noneuropean clients to the extent that they are or want to be invested in european assets 

for the insurance sector the solvency ii process will increase the amount of capital that insurers will have to set aside and will have an indirect effect on fund managers with insurance clients 

  

   

regulation continued 

  

in addition to the fsa the activities of certain blackrock subsidiaries branches and representative offices are overseen by financial services regulators in germany the netherlands ireland luxembourg switzerland isle of man jersey guernsey france belgium italy poland spain and sweden regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including among other things the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations in addition these regulators may subject certain blackrock subsidiaries to net capital requirements other blackrock subsidiaries branches and representative offices are regulated in japan australia china hong kong singapore taiwan south korea india dubai cayman islands brazil chile mexico and canada

continued capital losses on investments could have adverse income tax consequences 

the company may generate realized and unrealized capital losses on seed investments and coinvestments realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes the company has unrealized capital losses for which a deferred tax asset has been established in the event such unrealized losses are realized the company may not be able to offset such losses within the carryback or carryforward period or from future realized capital gains in which case the deferred tax asset will not be realized the failure to utilize the deferred tax asset could materially increase blackrock’s income tax expense 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect blackrock 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships blackrock and the products and accounts that it manages have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks clearing organizations mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose blackrock or the funds and accounts that it manages to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client while blackrock regularly conducts assessments of such risk posed by its counterparties the risk of nonperformance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets including the effects of the european sovereign debt crisis andor a collapse of the eurozone financial system there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely impact blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

the failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to reduced aum in similar products of blackrock without regard to the performance of blackrock’s products 

the failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products of blackrock without regard to the performance of blackrock’s products such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on the company’s aum revenues and earnings 

loss of employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

the ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to blackrock’s growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients the market for qualified fund managers investment analysts financial advisers and other professionals is competitive there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel loss of personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

separate account and commingled trust clients may terminate their investment management contracts with blackrock or withdraw funds on short notice the company has from time to time lost separate accounts and could in the future lose accounts or significant aum due to various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance 

additionally blackrock manages its us mutual funds closedend funds and exchangedtraded funds under management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds’ boards of directors annually a majority of the directors of each such fund are independent from blackrock consequently there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund managed by the company will approve the fund’s management contract each year or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the company  

further the governing agreements of many of the company’s private investment funds generally provide that subject to certain conditions investors in those funds and in some cases independent directors of those funds may remove blackrock as the investment adviser general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote resulting in a reduction in the management or performance fees as well as the total carried interest blackrock could earn 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against blackrock and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

when clients retain blackrock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf they typically specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the company is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to blackrock’s reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their aum or terminating their contracts any of which could cause the company’s revenues and earnings to decline 

  

   

competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins 

the investment management industry including the offering of exchangetraded funds is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry to the extent that blackrock is forced to compete on the basis of price it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline 

performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments performance fees represented 371 million or 4 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing earnings to be more volatile 

additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position 

blackrock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins these strategies have included hiring smallersized investment teams and acquisitions of investment management businesses such as the mlim quellos and bgi transactions these strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position in the investment management industry in the event blackrock pursues additional acquisitions it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from such acquisitions 

risks related to blackrock’s operations 

failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the company’s infrastructure including its technological capacity data centers and office space is vital to the competitiveness of its business the failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business including any expansion could impede the company’s productivity and growth which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline additionally the overall stability of the euro and the possible withdrawal of one or more individual eurozone countries from the euro could pose operational risks to the company or the funds and accounts that it manages as a result of the adverse impacts that such issues may have on the company’s trading clearing or counterparty relationships 

failure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on blackrock and its products 

a significant portion of blackrock’s critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas including san francisco california new york new york and london england a major earthquake fire terrorist or other catastrophic event could result in disruption to the business the failure of the company to maintain updated adequate business continuity plans including secure backup facilities systems and personnel could impede the company’s ability to operate upon a disruption which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

operating in international markets increases blackrock’s operational regulatory and other risks 

as a result of blackrock’s extensive international business activities the company faces increased operational regulatory reputational and foreign exchange rate risks the failure of the company’s systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

  

   

failure to maintain a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

a key element to blackrock’s continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into blackrock’s aladdin technology platform that support investment advisory and brs clients moreover the company’s technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data and software the failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and brs clients there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes 

failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in blackrock’s earnings or stock price 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information and cyber security policies procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a hacker attack virus or worm or an internally caused issue such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information and could result in material financial loss loss of competitive position regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause a decline in the company’s earnings or stock price 

the failure of a key vendor to blackrock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on blackrock and its products 

blackrock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration accounting custody and transfer agent roles and other operational needs the failure or inability of blackrock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational issues for the company and in certain products which could result in financial losses for the company and its clients 

failure to manage risks in operating blackrock’s securities lending program for clients could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues and liquidity 

the size of blackrock’s securities lending programs increased significantly with the completion of the bgi transaction as part of these programs blackrock must manage risks associated with i ensuring that the value of the collateral held against the securities on loan does not decline in value or become illiquid and that its nature and value complies with regulatory requirements and investment requirements ii the potential that a borrower defaults or does not return a loaned security on a timely basis and iii errors in the settlement of securities daily marktomarket valuations and collateral collection the failure of the company’s controls to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for the company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs as well as for the company 

risks related to relationships with bank of americamerrill lynch pnc barclays and other institutional investors 

merrill lynch is an important distributor of blackrock’s products and the company is therefore subject to risks associated with the business of merrill lynch 

under a global distribution agreement entered into with merrill lynch merrill lynch provides distribution portfolio administration and servicing for certain blackrock investment management products and services through its various distribution channels the company may not be successful in distributing products through merrill lynch or in distributing its products and services through other thirdparty distributors if blackrock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distributionrelated costs blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

  

   

loss of market share within merrill lynch’s global wealth  investment management business could harm operating results 

a significant portion of blackrock’s revenue has historically come from aum generated by merrill lynch’s global wealth  investment management “gwim” business blackrock’s ability to maintain a strong relationship within gwim is material to the company’s future performance if one of the company’s competitors gains significant additional market share within the gwim retail channel at the expense of blackrock then blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted 

the failure of barclays to fulfill its commitments or the inadequacy of the support provided under certain capital support agreements in favor of a number of cash management funds acquired in the bgi transaction could negatively impact such funds and blackrock 

barclays has provided capital support agreements through december 2013 or until certain criteria are met to support certain cash management products which were acquired by blackrock in the bgi transaction the failure of barclays to fulfill its obligations under these agreements or the inadequacy of the support provided could cause our clients to suffer losses and blackrock to suffer reputational and other adverse impacts for a discussion on the capital support agreements see “management discussion and analysis – liquidity and capital resources – barclays support of certain cash funds” 

pnc and barclays have each agreed to vote as stockholders in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of pnc and barclays 

pnc and barclays have agreed to vote all of their voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors in accordance with the provisions of their respective stockholder agreements with blackrock as a consequence if the shares held by pnc and barclays constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval including elections of directors will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determinations of the blackrock board of directors this arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over blackrock in its board of directors whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the board at december 31 2011 pnc and barclays owned approximately 240 and 22 respectively of blackrock’s voting common stock 

a large portion of blackrock’s capital stock is held by a small group of significant shareholders future sales of our common stock in the public market by the company or its large stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

as of december 31 2011 pnc and barclays owned 210 and 197 of the company’s capital stock respectively the company has entered into registration rights agreements with pnc and barclays as well as the institutional investors who purchased shares of blackrock capital stock in connection with the bgi transaction the registration rights agreements which include customary “piggyback” registration provisions may continue to allow the respective stockholders to cause us to file one or more registration statements for the resale of their respective shares of capital stock and cooperate in certain underwritten offerings sales by us or our large stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market pursuant to registration rights or otherwise or the perception that these sales might occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline

failure to comply with the advisers act and the investment company act and related regulations could result in substantial harm to blackrock’s reputation and results of operations 

certain blackrock subsidiaries are registered with the sec under the advisers act and blackrock’s us mutual funds and exchangetraded funds are registered with the sec under the investment company act the advisers act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers including recordkeeping operating and marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes similar obligations as well as additional detailed operational and compliance requirements on investment advisers to registered investment companies the failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with the advisers act or the investment company act could cause the sec to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts including censure termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to secregistered funds and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the company’s reputation any of which could cause its earnings or stock price to decline

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” however management believes that evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap basis financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators for both management and investors of blackrock’s financial performance over time blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 

computations for all periods are derived from the company’s consolidated statements of income as follows 

 

 operating income as adjusted equals operating income gaap basis excluding certain items management deems nonrecurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value as indicated in the table below operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and commissions operating margin as adjusted equals operating income used for operating margin measurement divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement as indicated in the table below 

 

 management believes operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time and therefore provide useful disclosure to investors

operating income as adjusted 

bgi transaction and integration costs consisted principally of compensation expense legal fees marketing and promotional occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the bgi acquisition from barclays restructuring charges recorded in 2011 and 2009 consisted of compensation costs and professional fees restructuring charges in 2009 also included occupancy costs uk lease exit costs represent costs to exit two locations in london in the third quarter 2011 

the portion of compensation expense associated with certain longterm incentive plans “ltip” that has been or will be funded through distributions to participants of shares of blackrock stock held by pnc and a merrill lynch cash compensation contribution a portion of which has been received has been excluded because these charges ultimately do not impact blackrock’s book value the expense related to the merrill lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of the third quarter 2011 

compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans which substantially offset this expense are reported in nonoperating income expense 

management believes operating income exclusive of these costs is a useful measure in evaluating blackrock’s operating performance and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented 

operating margin as adjusted 

operating income used for measuring operating margin as adjusted is equal to operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and commissions management believes the exclusion of such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the company’s results until future periods 

operating margin as adjusted allows the company to compare performance from periodtoperiod by adjusting for items that may not recur recur infrequently or may have an economic offset in nonoperating income examples of such adjustments include restructuring charges bgi transaction and integration costs uk lease exit costs closedend fund launch costs commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctuations in compensation expense based on marktomarket movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans the company also uses operating margin as adjusted to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies management uses both the gaap and nongaap financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of blackrock the nongaap measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the company’s revenues and expenses 

revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services which due to the terms of the contracts are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time offset distribution fee revenue earned by the company blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues

 management believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides comparability of this information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock’s nonoperating contribution to its results as compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans which is included in operating income substantially offsets the gain loss on the investments set aside for these plans management believes nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides a useful measure for both management and investors of blackrock’s nonoperating results that impact book value

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2 significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k 

consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products  consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products collectively “investment products” is determined pursuant to asc 810 consolidation  the accounting method used by the company depends upon the influence the company has over its investee the investment product to the extent that blackrock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product which generally exists if there is a 50 or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights blackrock consolidates the investment product 

for investment products in which blackrock’s voting interest is less than 50 an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a variable interest entity “vie” or a voting rights entity upon the determination that the investment product is a vie further analysis as discussed below is performed to determine if blackrock is the primary beneficiary “pb” of the investment product which would require consolidation 

consolidation of variable interest entities  pursuant to asc 81010 certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed vies blackrock reviews factors including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns to determine if the investment product is a vie blackrock is required to consolidate a vie when it is deemed to be the pb which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change 

asu 201010 amendments to statement 167 for certain investment funds “asu 201010” defers the application of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r for certain investment funds including money market funds 

the pb of a vie that meets the conditions of asu 201010 is the enterprise that has a variable interest or combination of variable interests including those of related parties that absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both effective january 1 2010 the pb of a vie that does not meet the conditions for deferral in asu 201010 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie 

significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the company is the pb of a vie if the company together with its related parties is determined to be the pb of a vie blackrock will consolidate the entity in order to determine whether the company is the pb of a vie for entities that meet the conditions of asu 201010 management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios assumptions made in such analyses include but are not limited to market prices of securities market interest rates potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities gain realization liquidity or marketability of certain securities discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes 

in the normal course of business the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles including collateralized debt obligations “cdos” or clos that do not meet the conditions of asu 201010 and sponsored investment funds which may be considered vies at december 31 2011 the company consolidated five vies including four clos and one sponsored private equity fund

consolidation of variable interest entities continued 

  

at december 31 2011 the following balances related to the five vies consolidated on the company’s consolidated statement of financial condition 

 

 as of december 31 2011 blackrock was the manager of over 20 closcdos and other securitization entities including the four aforementioned clos in which blackrock in accordance with asu 200917 was determined to be the pb which required blackrock to consolidate these vies blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities of the clo that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie at december 31 2011 the company had 1655 million and 1583 million in assets and liabilities respectively on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated clos in addition the company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference between the assets and liabilities as the clo noteholders not blackrock ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the clo’s assets and liabilities the changes in the assets and liabilities of these clos have no impact on net income attributable to blackrock or its cash flows excluding outstanding management fee receivables the company has no risk of loss with its involvement with these vies 

at december 31 2011 blackrock was determined to be the pb of one sponsored private equity investment fund of funds in which it had a nonsubstantive investment and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its defacto thirdparty relationships with other partners in the fund which limits the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without blackrock’s consent as the general partner of the fund at december 31 2011 the company had recorded 7 million 31 million and 38 million in cash and cash equivalents private equity investments and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests of consolidated vies respectively on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to this vie the changes in the assets and liabilities of this vie have no impact on net income attributable to blackrock excluding outstanding management fee receivables the company has no risk of loss with its involvement with this vie 

  

critical accounting policies continued 

  

consolidation of voting rights entities  to the extent that blackrock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which generally exists if there is a 50 or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights blackrock consolidates the investee 

the company as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies pursuant to asc 81020 control of partnerships and similar entities “asc 81020” the company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other nonaffiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the investment vehicle or otherwise to remove blackrock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote or have other substantive participating rights if the investment vehicle is not a vie and the presumption of control is not overcome blackrock will consolidate the investment vehicle 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities including products where blackrock owns 50 of greater of the voting rights of the product under the consolidation policies described above the company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition 

 

 the company retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to asc 81010 vies including a consolidated sponsored investment fund and clos were excluded from the balances above as these balances are reported separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition 

investments 

equity method investments  for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where the company is not the pb of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company uses the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity

investments continued 

  

equity method investments continued 

  

substantially all of blackrock’s equity method investees are investment companies that record their underlying investments at fair value therefore under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income expense for investments in investment companies or as other revenue for operating advisory company investments which are recorded in other assets since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock’s core business 

at december 31 2011 the company had 476 million and 80 million of equity method investments including equity method investments held for deferred compensation reflected within investments and other assets respectively and at december 31 2010 the company had 583 million and 58 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets respectively 

impairment of investment s the company’s management periodically assesses its equity method availableforsale heldtomaturity and cost investments for impairment if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist investments are evaluated using market values where available or the expected future cash flows of the investment if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the company’s carrying value of the investment an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income 

when the fair value of an availableforsale security is lower than cost the company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered to be “otherthantemporary” 

in making this determination for equity securities the company considers among other factors the length of time the security has been in a loss position the extent to which the security’s market value is less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses if the impairment is considered otherthantemporary a charge is recorded in the consolidated statement of income 

in making this determination for debt securities the company considers whether 1 the company has the intent to sell the security 2 it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery or 3 the company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security if the company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered a credit loss the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income

impairment of investments continued 

  

evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated statements of income 

fair value measurements 

hierarchy of fair value inputs  the provisions of asc 82010 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 

assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories 

level 1 inputs 

quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date 

 

 level 2 inputs 

quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active quotes from pricing services or brokers for which the company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as models or other valuation methodologies as a practical expedient the company relies on the nav or its equivalent of certain investments as their fair value 

 

 level 3 inputs 

unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability which may include nonbinding broker quotes level 3 assets include investments for which there is little if any market activity these inputs require significant management judgment or estimation certain investments that are valued using navs and are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in level 3 

 

   

critical accounting policies continued 

  

fair value measurements continued 

  

hierarchy of fair value inputs continued 

  

  

 significance of inputs  the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument 

pricing services and broker quotes  a significant amount of inputs used to value equity and debt securities are sourced from wellrecognized thirdparty pricing vendors generally prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price annually blackrock reviews both the valuation methodology including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes and operational process with these vendors in addition on a quarterly basis meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ processes 

in addition quotes obtained from brokers generally are nonbinding and categorized as level 3 inputs however if the company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable the quote is classified as a level 2 input 

significant transfers into and out of levels 1 2 and 3  during the year ended december 31 2010 the company reclassified approximately 47 million of net investments out of level 3 predominantly to level 2 the majority of the net reclassifications were related to investments that the company values using a nav or a capital account and it currently has the ability to redeem in the near term 

changes in valuation  changes in value on 1116 million of investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense 52 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income 442 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 21 million related to carried interest has no impact on nonoperating income expense as of december 31 2011 changes in fair value of approximately 587 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact blackrock’s net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was 475 million

goodwill and intangible assets 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 the carrying amounts of the company’s goodwill and intangible assets were as follows 

 

 the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary open and closedend investment funds as well as collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date is generally classified as indefinitelived intangible assets the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost in addition trade namestrademarks are considered indefinitelived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with the applicable provisions of asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other “asc 350” indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2011 ranged from 2 years to 13 years with a weightedaverage remaining estimated useful life of 54 years 

goodwill  the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment test performed as of july 31 2011 indicated no impairment charge was required the company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2011 the company’s common stock closed at 17824 which exceeded its book value per share of approximately 14007 after excluding appropriated retained earnings 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles  the company considers if triggering events have occurred that may indicate fair values have declined below their respective carrying amounts on a quarterly basis triggering events may include significant adverse changes in the company’s business financial results legal or regulatory environment the loss of key personnel or other events if a triggering event has occurred the company performs assessments which include a review of all significant assumptions that would be used to value the asset to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired the company performs such assessments of its intangible assets at least annually in its assessment of management contracts and trade namestrademarks the company considers various factors including aum revenue basis points projected aum growth rates operating margins tax rates and discount rates to determine whether the carrying values of each intangible asset unit of account are potentially impaired and whether the indefinitelife classification is still appropriate

if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform an impairment test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis if the asset is determined to be impaired the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 156 million 160 million and 147 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

in 2011 2010 and 2009 the company performed impairment tests that indicated no impairment charges were required the classification of indefinitelived versus finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles were required the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

income taxes  the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by asc 740 income taxes  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

the application of asc 740 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes that require significant management judgment actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2011 blackrock had 349 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 226 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

in accordance with asc 740 management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2011 the company had deferred tax assets of 6 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately 5323 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company asc 740 requires the company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives

income taxes continued 

  

at december 31 2011 the company had recorded a deferred tax asset of 110 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized hold certain equity method investments which invest in fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized however changes in circumstance could cause the company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change such changes may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements see note 19 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for further details 

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivable of approximately 108 million and current income taxes payable of 102 million at december 31 2011 

revenue recognition  investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or in the case of certain real estate clients net operating income generated by the underlying properties investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange translation and net subscriptions or redemptions investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers 

the company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the company such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund in certain cases the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that blackrock bears no credit risk to the third party the company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with asc 60545 revenue recognition – principle agent considerations “asc 60545” and records its management fees net of retrocessions retrocessions for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were 928 million 831 million and 611 million respectively the company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which due to the terms of the contracts are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income 

the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients primarily to brokerage institutions such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash and securities generally ranging from 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or other thirdparty accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 securities lending revenue totaled 397 million 325 million and 36 million respectively and is recorded in investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income 

investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee

revenue recognition continued 

  

the company receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separately managed accounts these performance fees are earned upon exceeding specified relative andor absolute investment return thresholds such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which varies by product or account and could be monthly quarterly annually or longer for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 performance fee revenue totaled 371 million 540 million and 202 million respectively in addition the company receives carried interest from certain alternative products upon exceeding performance thresholds blackrock may be required to return all or part of such carried interest depending upon performance of these funds therefore blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition carried interest is realized and recorded as performance fees upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable the company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2011 and 2010 the company had 33 million and 23 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition the ultimate recognition of revenue if any for these products is unknown 

fees earned for blackrock solutions  which include advisory services are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some or all of the following methods i fixed fees ii percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform and iii performance fees if contractual thresholds are met revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of onetime advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on aum of the respective portfolio assignment for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 blackrock solutions and advisory revenue totaled 510 million 460 million and 477 million respectively 

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of aum and since the company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable 

  

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

amendments to fair value measurements and disclosures  in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 201104 fair value measurement  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss “asu 201104” which amends the existing fair value guidance within asc 820 the amendments include

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend aum market price risk  blackrock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on aum at december 31 2011 the majority of the company’s investment advisory and administration fees was based on average or period end aum of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts movements in equity market prices interest ratescredit spreads foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of aum to decline which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees 

corporate investments portfolio risks as a leading investment management firm blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying measuring monitoring managing and analyzing market and operating risks including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio the board of directors of the company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the company requiring among other things investments be reviewed by the company’s capital committee which consists of senior officers of the company and that certain investments may be referred to the audit committee or the board of directors depending on the circumstances for approval 

in the normal course of its business blackrock is exposed to equity market price risk interest ratecredit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments 

blackrock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate private equity and hedge funds investments generally are made for coinvestment purposes to establish a performance track record to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes currently the company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain investments at december 31 2011 the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately 43 million 

  

corporate investments portfolio risks continued 

  

at december 31 2011 approximately 587 million of blackrock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds deemed to be controlled by blackrock in accordance with gaap and therefore are consolidated even though blackrock may not own a majority of such funds excluding the impact of the federal reserve bank stock carried interest investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain equity investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program the company’s economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows 

 

 the “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the equity market price or the interest ratecredit spread risk disclosures below 

equity market price risk  at december 31 2011 the company’s net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately 596 million of the company’s total economic investment exposure investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments hedge funds and fund of funds as well as mutual funds the company estimates that a 10 adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately 596 million in the carrying value of such investments 

interest ratecredit spread risk  at december 31 2011 the company was exposed to interestrate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately 466 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments in the aggregate would result in a decrease or increase of approximately 3 million in the carrying value of such investments 

foreign exchange rate risk  as discussed above the company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes the carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies primarily the pound sterling and euro was 152 million a 10 adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a 152 million decline in the carrying value of such investments

overview continued 

selected financial results for the last six years are shown below 

 

  

  see additional information in item 6 selected financial data 

blackrock reports its financial results using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” however management believes that evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap basis financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators for both management and investors of blackrock’s financial performance over time blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap certain prior year nongaap data has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 

  

   

overview continued 

operating income as adjusted 

gaap reported operating income includes certain significant items the aftertax impact of which management considers nonrecurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value and therefore are excluded in calculating operating income as adjusted 

operating income as adjusted a nongaap measure excludes certain expenses incurred related to the integration of the acquisitions of ssrm holdings inc “ssr” merrill lynch investment managers “mlim” the fund of funds business of quellos group llc “quellos” and bgi as well as advisory fees legal fees and consulting transaction expenses related to the bgi transaction a 2007 termination fee for closedend fund administration and servicing arrangements with merrill lynch 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges and compensation expense associated with appreciationdepreciation on assets related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans these expenses have been excluded from operating income as adjusted because they have been deemed nonrecurring by management and to help enhance the comparability of this information to prior periods 

the portion of compensation expense associated with certain of blackrock’s longterm incentive plan “ltip” awards that has or will be funded through distributions to participants of shares of blackrock stock held by pnc and a merrill lynch cash compensation contribution a portion of which has been received has been excluded because exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of ltip participants’ put options primarily in the three months ended march 31 2007 these charges do not impact blackrock’s book value a detailed discussion of the ltip funded by pnc is included in note 15 stockbased compensation to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k 

compensation expense associated with appreciationdepreciation on assets related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans which substantially offset this expense are reported in nonoperating income expense 

management believes that operating income exclusive of these costs is more representative of the operating performance for the respective periods 

operating margin as adjusted 

operating income used for measuring operating margin as adjusted is equal to operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and commissions management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the company’s results until future periods 

operating margin as adjusted allows the company to compare performance from periodtoperiod by adjusting for items that may not recur recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements such as restructuring charges transactionintegration costs closedend fund launch costs and fluctuations in deferred compensation expense based on marktomarket movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans the company also uses operating margin as adjusted to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance to other companies management reviews both the gaap and nongaap financial measures 

  

   

overview continued 

operating margin as adjusted continued 

revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties management believes that excluding such costs is useful to blackrock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services which due to the terms of the contracts are accounted under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time offset distribution fee revenue earned by the company reimbursable property management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of metric property management inc “metric” a subsidiary of blackrock realty advisors inc “realty” prior to the transfer in 2008 to a third party these employees were retained on metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by realty’s clients the related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted because they did not bear an economic cost to blackrock for each of these items blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues 

nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests as adjusted 

nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests as adjusted equals nonoperating income expense gaap basis less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests gaap basis adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation or appreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans the compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income this compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests as adjusted to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans which are reported in nonoperating income expense gaap basis 

management believes that nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests as adjusted provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock’s nonoperating contribution to its consolidated results as compensation expense associated with depreciation or appreciation on assets related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans which is included in operating income offsets the gainloss on the investments set aside for these plans management believes that nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests as adjusted provides a useful measure for both management and investors of blackrock’s nonoperating results that impact book value 

net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted 

gaap reported net income attributable to blackrock inc and gaap diluted earnings per common share include certain significant items the aftertax impact of which management considers nonrecurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value or do not have a cash flow impact and therefore are excluded in calculating net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted 

net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted and diluted earnings per common share as adjusted nongaap measures exclude the aftertax impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges the 2007 termination of closedend fund administration and servicing arrangements with merrill lynch ltip expense to be funded by pnc and by a merrill lynch cash compensation contribution a portion of which has been received the ssr mlim quellos and bgi integration costs bgi transaction costs and the effect on deferred income tax expense attributable to changes in corporate income tax rates as a result of enacted legislation

equity and fixed income aum include a wide range of active and passive strategies in total equity aum increased 1584 billion or 10 to 1694 trillion at yearend 2010 growth was driven by 691 billion of net new business and 1971 billion of investment performance and market appreciation fixed income aum ended 2010 at 1141 trillion up 857 billion or 8 relative to december 31 2009 net new business contributed 360 billion of the growth while markets and investment performance contributed 661 billion mergerrelated outflows totaled 994 billion and 199 billion in equities and fixed income respectively primarily due to manager concentration and underperformance in scientific active equities see additional discussion under “aum by style” below 

multiasset class 

blackrock’s multiasset class aum ended 2010 at 1856 billion an increase of 31 or 436 billion during the year we were awarded 263 billion of net new business and portfolio values rose 139 billion blackrock’s multiasset class team manages a variety of bespoke mandates that leverage our broad investment expertise in global equities currencies bonds and commodities and our extensive risk management capabilities investment solutions might include a combination of longonly portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays the products are described briefly below 

blackrock’s multiasset class products were managed on behalf of a wellbalanced client base at december 31 2010 institutional investors represented 56 of multiasset class aum while retail and high net worth investors accounted for 44 flows were almost evenly split as well with 153 billion or 59 and 107 billion or 41 coming from institutional and retail and high net worth investors respectively the geographic mix was similarly diversified with 59 of multiasset class aum managed for clients based in the americas 32 in europe the middle east and africa “emea” and 9 in asiapacific during the year clients in the americas and emea awarded blackrock net new business of 266 billion which offset net outflows of 05 billion from clients in asiapacific 

 

  

  

 volatile investor sentiment presented challenges for asset allocation strategies in 2010 while 35 of multiasset class aum achieved returns above their benchmarks or peer medians for the one year longerterm results remained strong with 81 of multiasset class aum outperforming for the three years and 87 for the five years ended december 31 2010

alternative investments 

blackrock ended 2010 with 1097 billion of aum in its alternative investment products an increase of 76 billion net outflows totaled 01 billion as withdrawals and disbursements in real estate currency and opportunistic funds were offset by inflows in single and multistrategy hedge funds global macro funds funds of hedge funds and commodity products we believe that as investors adapt their asset allocation strategies to best meet their investment objectives in the current environment they will continue to increase their use of alternative investments to complement their core holdings 

the alternative investment client base was predominantly institutional representing 75 or 818 billion of alternatives aum with retail and high net worth investors comprising 8 or 93 billion of aum at december 31 2010 ishares comprised 186 billion or 17 of ending aum the geographic mix was well diversified with 55 of aum managed for clients in the americas 24 for clients in emea and 21 for clients in asiapacific 

during 2010 we launched blackrock alternative investors “bai” to coordinate our alternative investment efforts including product management business development and client service the products offered under the bai umbrella are described below 

 

  

  

  

 cash management and securities lending 

aum in cash management products totaled 2792 billion at december 31 2010 a decrease of 701 billion or 20 from aum reported at yearend 2009 investors continued to look for higher returns by reallocating balances to deposits and operations and to a lesser extent longerterm investment products cash management products include taxable and taxexempt money market funds and customized separate accounts portfolios may be denominated in us dollar euro or pound sterling 

  

   

products continued 

our cash management clientele is largely institutional with 85 of cash aum managed for institutions and 15 for retail and high net worth investors at yearend 2010 the investor base was also predominantly domestic with 75 managed for investors in the americas and 25 for clients in other regions almost all emeabased we suffered net outflows during the year as investors sought higher yields in bank deposits direct money market investments and as they became more confident of the market recovery in longerterm assets clients also used their cash for operating purposes as business investment increased and merger and acquisition activity increased we expect these trends to continue which will continue to put pressure on cash management flows 

the cash management team also invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios securities lending which is offered as a potential source of incremental returns on longterm portfolios is managed by a dedicated team supported by quantitative analysis proprietary technology and disciplined risk management fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings andor a percentage of the value of the cash collateral the value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the corresponding asset class in aum the value of the cash or securities collateral is not included in cash management aum 

the combination of the legacy businesses along with the addition of new lending mandates has increased lendable inventory and solidified blackrock as a top tier provider of lendable assets outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately 104 billion down slightly from 111 billion at yearend 2009 balance volatility throughout 2010 was lower than in recent years demand remained weak as relatively few securities command premium lending fees this trend is expected to continue through 2011 with a turnaround occurring when the endborrowers of securities begin rerisking and putting their capital to work with more conviction 

blackrock employs a conservative investment style that emphasizes quality liquidity and superior client service throughout all market cycles disciplined risk management including a rigorous credit surveillance process is an integral part of the investment process blackrock’s cash management risk committee has established risk limits such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits across many of the products blackrock manages including over all of its cash management products in the ordinary course of our business there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed and no such instances individually or in the aggregate have been material to the company to the extent that daily evaluationreporting of the profile of the portfolios identifies that a limit has been exceeded the relevant portfolio will be adjusted to the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers while a risk limit may be waived such temporary waivers are infrequent

 component changes in longterm aum by style 

 

  

  longterm 1 product offerings include active and passive index strategies the investment objective for active portfolios is to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle alpha in contrast passive strategies seek to closely track the returns of the corresponding index beta generally by investing in the securities that comprise the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate the risk and return profile of the index 

the bgi transaction included an atscale index business that materially changed blackrock’s aum mix index aum including institutional and ishares products increased from 4 of aum at yearend 2008 prior to the bgi transaction to 54 of aum at december 31 2010 

although many clients use both active and passive strategies the profile of these assets differs greatly for example clients often use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class pending reallocation to an active manager this has the effect of increasing turnover on index aum in addition institutional index assignments tend to be very large multibillion dollars and priced at low fee rates this has the effect of exaggerating the significance of net flows in institutional index on blackrock’s earnings

active strategies

  we offer two types of active strategies those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive security selection and portfolio construction at yearend 2010 active longterm aum increased 180 billion to 1190 trillion at yearend of which 28 was in equities 50 in fixed income 15 in multiasset and 7 in alternatives favorable markets contributed 894 billion of growth which was slightly offset by 20 billion of net outflows aum growth was significantly hampered by mergerrelated outflows of 646 billion primarily in scientific active equities “sae” 

active equity 

blackrock’s active equity aum closed the year at 3345 billion a decline of 4 or 140 billion relative to yearend 2009 net new business contributed 26 billion of growth while investment and market performance added 417 billion a wide variety of products are offered including global and regional portfolios value growth and core products large mid and small cap strategies and selected sector funds we believe an improving us economy strong corporate balance sheets and sustained strong growth in the emerging markets bodes well for equity markets in 2011 although geopolitical risk remains a potential drag on investor sentiment 

blackrock manages active equity portfolios for a diverse base of institutional and retail and high net worth investors globally at december 31 2010 approximately half of active equity aum 1658 billion was managed on behalf of institutional investors in separate accounts collective investment trusts and mutual funds and half 1687 billion for retail and high net worth investors largely through openend mutual funds and separately managed accounts approximately 46 of our active equity aum was managed for investors based in the americas 39 in emea and 15 in asiapacific

blackrock’s active fixed income aum ended 2010 at 5923 billion a slight decrease of 1 or 33 billion from the previous year’s results during the year we had 221 billion of net outflows partially offset by 323 billion of investment and market performance fixed income mandates are often tailored to clientspecified liabilities accounting regulatory or rating agency requirements or other investment policies us bonds enjoyed good absolute returns in 2010 despite a slight pullback during the fourth quarter the barclays capital us aggregate index returned 65 for the year while sovereign credit risk remains a concern particularly in parts of europe inflation is not expected to have a material impact on federal reserve policy in 2011 

of blackrock’s total active fixed income aum 82 was managed on behalf of institutional investors and 18 for retail and high net worth investors the client base reflects our historical roots with 69 of active fixed income aum managed for investors in the americas 23 for emea domiciled clients and 8 for investors in the asiapacific region net inflows of 13 billion from asiapacific clients were more than offset by outflows of 234 billion from investors in the americas and emea

  ishares is the leading etf provider in the world with 5902 billion of aum at december 31 2010 an increase of 960 billion or 19 since yearend 2009 we were the top asset gatherer globally in 2010 2  with 440 billion of net inflows complemented by 520 billion of market appreciation we also introduced 78 new etps during the year maintaining our dual commitment to innovation and responsible product structuring our broad product range offers investors the building blocks required to assemble diversified portfolios and implement tactical asset allocation strategies and the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and costefficiently 

the market for etps continues to grow globally with investor preference driven to varying degrees by performance as measured by tracking error which is the difference between net returns on the etp and the corresponding index liquidity bidask spread taxefficiency transparency and client service flows also reflect investor risk appetite which shifted toward fixed income and within equities to broad and single country emerging market funds in 2010 in early 2011 investors have begun to shift equity allocations back to developed markets 

at yearend our ishares product mix included 4482 billion or 76 in equity offerings and 1231 billion or 21 in bond etps the remaining 190 billion or 3 of ishares aum was in multiasset and alternative investments ishares equity aum increased 668 billion or 18 versus 2009 with 219 billion in net inflows and 449 billion of market and foreign exchange appreciation ishares fixed income aum rose 206 billion or 20 over the previous year with 92 of the increase being driven by 190 billion of net inflows ishares multiasset and alternatives aum grew by 86 billion or 84 with 32 billion of net inflows predominately in commodity products such as gold and silver and 55 billion of market and foreign exchange appreciation 

in total we had net inflows in 315 different etps during 2010 as of yearend we managed three of the top five six of the top ten and twelve of the 20 largest etfs in the us 2 our ishares offerings were traded on 19 exchanges throughout the world these included 276 funds 2 in the americas with 4803 billion or 81 of ishares aum assets in these funds increased 776 billion or 19 during the year including 278 billion of net inflows

notwithstanding a substantial increase in the number of etp sponsors and products ishares has maintained market share of more than 48 in the us and 36 in emea 3  in addition we are the largest etf manager in mexico have pioneered the product in chile and peru and have introduced products in brazil australia hong kong and japan importantly our share of revenues is significantly higher due to our product mix in general we expect to maintain our pricing so long as it is supported by performance and the ishares value proposition although we continually seek to achieve efficiencies and pass them through to our clients 

blackrock solutions and advisory 

blackrock offers investment systems risk management outsourcing and advisory services under the blackrock solutions brand name over 100 trillion of positions are processed on our aladdin operating platform which serves as the investment system for blackrock and a growing number of sophisticated institutional investors around the world brs also offers comprehensive risk reporting via the green package ® and risk management advisory services interactive fixed income analytics through our webbased calculator anser ®  middle and back office outsourcing services and investment accounting clients have also retained brs’ financial markets advisory “fma” group for a variety of engagements such as valuation and risk assessment of illiquid assets portfolio restructuring workouts and dispositions of distressed assets and financial and balance sheet strategies 

as global capital markets have recovered clients have focused more on risk management and demand for brs services continues to be robust during the year brs added 62 net new assignments while revenue declined modestly by 4 to 460 million demand was strong for aladdin and risk management services with yearoveryear revenue growing 14 particularly in emea where we signed a record number of new brs clients onto the platform aladdin assignments are longterm contracts providing significant recurring revenue 

during the year we added 49 new fma assignments and completed 33 engagements the nature of fma assignments shifted from urgent shortterm risk analyses to longer term advisory and risk monitoring engagements with yearoveryear revenue declining 23 as the crisis subsided and fewer clients required emergency valuation and liquidation services advisory aum decreased 7 to 1507 billion with 15 billion of market appreciation insufficient to offset 120 billion of client distributions in these longterm liquidation portfolios 

at yearend brs served 149 clients including banks insurance companies official institutions pension funds asset managers and other institutional investors across north america europe asia and australia during the year blackrock acquired and integrated helix financial group llc to enhance brs ’ commercial real estate capabilities which proved to be critical to brs ’ success in winning several high profile assignments we will continue to consider acquisition opportunities that can expand aladdin functionality and our risk management expertise 

the brs and aladdin teams are also supporting key aspects of the bgi integration these efforts are vital to establishing a unified operating platform and consistent operating processes we expect functionality added in connection with the integration to enhance the aladdin platform over time additionally we will seek to leverage our scale for the benefit of our clients through the creation of a robust global trading platform and other initiatives

the mix by investment style is also balanced with 39 of longterm aum managed in active products 35 in institutional index accounts and 26 in ishares and other etps at yearend note that the ishares figures are based on the jurisdiction of the fund rather than the underlying investor nonus investors often prefer us ishares  primarily due to the depth of the markets and liquidity of the products 

emea 

aum for clients based in emea ended the year at 1017 trillion or 29 of total aum an increase of 797 billion from 2009 during the year clients awarded us net new business of 280 billion including inflows from investors in 24 countries across the region our offerings include fund families in the uk luxembourg and dublin and ishares listed on stock exchanges throughout europe as well as separate accounts and pooled investment products 

clients invested across the entire product spectrum with 51 of longterm aum in equities 40 in fixed income 6 in multiasset class and 3 in alternatives emea clients constitute the remaining 25 of our cash management aum and represent just 3 of our advisory aum brs has steadily built its presence in emea including aladdin relationships with a variety of institutional investors and fma engagements for financial services companies and official institutions including the valuation assignment announced in january 2011 for the central bank of ireland 

the mix by investment style is slightly more concentrated than in the americas with 36 invested in active products 53 in institutional index accounts and 11 in ishares and other etps the relatively higher percentage in institutional index is driven by low fee institutional liability hedging portfolios which account for approximately 25 of total institutional index assets the relatively lower percentage in ishares primarily reflects the fact that the european etp market is at an earlier stage of development 

asiapacific 

clients in the asiapacific region are served through offices in japan australia hong kong singapore taiwan and korea and joint ventures in china and india at december 31 2010 we managed 3672 billion of aum for clients in the region an increase of 5 or 162 billion from 2009 net new business contributed 154 billion and the remainder of the increase was attributable to investment performance and favorable market movements we also acquired the taiwanbased asset manager primasia investment trust co ltd strengthening our onshore investment capabilities by offering locally managed investment solutions 

at yearend the mix of longterm products managed for these clients consisted of 46 equities 43 fixed income 5 multiasset class and 6 alternative investments asiapacific clients represented 2 of our advisory aum and less than 1 of our cash management aum brs served a select number of the largest and most sophisticated investors in the region 

the mix among investment styles was more tilted toward institutional index accounts than in the other regions with 2199 billion or 61 of longterm aum in these products this bias can be traced to the presence of very large governmental institutions and pensions that are heavy users of index products asiapacific institutional investors also use ishares for tactical allocation but often favor the liquidity of the us products which are counted in americas ishares  active mandates represented 36 of aum managed for investors in the region at yearend

competition 

blackrock competes with investment management firms mutual fund complexes insurance companies banks brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to or alternatives to those offered by blackrock in order to grow its business blackrock must be able to compete effectively for aum key competitive factors include investment performance track records the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products investment style and discipline client service and brand name recognition historically the company has competed principally on the basis of its longterm investment performance track record its investment process its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service certain of the company’s competitors however have greater marketing resources than blackrock particularly in retail channels these factors may place blackrock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing aum and to attract new business will be successful

regulation 

virtually all aspects of blackrock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations both in and outside the united states some of which are summarized below these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients investors in registered and unregistered investment companies trust customers of blackrock institutional trust company na “btc” and the bank subsidiaries of bank of america and pnc and their customers under these laws and regulations agencies that regulate investment advisers investment funds and financial and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries such as blackrock and its subsidiaries have broad administrative powers including the power to limit restrict or prohibit the regulated entity from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time revocation of investment adviser and other registrations censures and fines the rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical accordingly the discussion below is general in nature and does not purport to be complete 

regulatory reform 

on july 21 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “dfa” was signed into law in the united states the dfa is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be implemented the adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the dfa on blackrock the dfa may significantly change blackrock’s operating environment in unpredictable ways it is not possible to predict the ultimate effects that the dfa or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions will have upon blackrock’s business and results of operations among the potential impacts of the dfa provisions of the dfa referred to as the volcker rule could affect the method by which blackrock invests in and operates its private equity funds hedge funds and fund of funds platforms in addition blackrock could become designated as a systemically important financial institution “sifi” and become subject to direct supervision by the federal reserve system the “federal reserve” if blackrock were designated as a sifi it could be subject to enhanced prudential supervisory and other requirements such as riskbased capital requirements leverage limits liquidity requirements resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements concentration limits a contingent capital requirement enhanced public disclosures shortterm debt limits and overall risk management requirements further proposed regulations under the dfa relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner by which blackrock and blackrock advised funds use and trade swaps and other derivatives and could expose blackrock to increased costs as the derivatives market moves toward central clearing and increased position reporting other jurisdictions outside the united states in which blackrock operates are also in the process of devising or considering more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry which could have a similar impact on blackrock 

the dfa and its regulations and other new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities require blackrock to change certain business practices and expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and tax costs and liabilities as well as reputational harm for example in addition to regulatory changes mandated by the dfa the securities and exchange commission the “sec” has adopted new regulations related to and continues to review the role and risks related to money market funds and have indicated that it may adopt additional regulations some of the proposed changes if adopted could significantly alter money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry similarly the sec continues to review the distribution fees paid to mutual fund distributors in accordance with rule 12b1 under the investment company act of 1940 which are important to a number of the mutual funds we manage any changes to 12b1 fees would alter the way our distribution partners distribute our products regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions could materially and adversely impact the value of assets in which blackrock has invested directly andor on behalf of clients and to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms could make it more difficult for blackrock to conduct certain businesses or distinguish itself from competitors 

additional legislation changes in rules promulgated by regulators and selfregulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of blackrock blackrock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce

regulation continued

nonus regulation 

blackrock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies and bodies as blackrock continues to expand its international presence a number of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems comparable to those affecting its operations in the united states 

the financial services authority the “fsa” currently regulates certain blackrock subsidiaries in the united kingdom authorization by the fsa is required to conduct any financial services related business in the united kingdom pursuant to the financial services and markets act 2000 the fsa’s rules govern a firm’s capital resources requirements senior management arrangements conduct of business interaction with clients and systems and controls breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the company’s ukregulated subsidiaries the uk government has announced that it intends to abolish the fsa and to establish three new regulatory bodies the financial policy committee the prudential regulation authority and the financial conduct authority in its place more detailed proposals including draft legislation are expected early in 2011 with the aim being for the new regulatory structure to be in place by the end of 2012

 as a leading investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks while blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify measure monitor manage and analyze market and operating risks blackrock’s business financial condition operating results or nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected or our stock price could decline by any of the following risks 

risks related to blackrock’s business and competition 

changes in the value levels of the capital commodities or currency markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in revenues and earnings 

blackrock’s investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns earned on aum movements in equity debt or commodity market prices interest rates or foreign exchange rates could cause 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of any of these events could result in lower investment advisory administration and performance fees or earnings and cause our stock price to decline

 item 1a risk factors continued tableend   

poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues and earnings 

the company’s management believes that investment performance including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of aum poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could reduce revenues and cause earnings to decline as a result of 

 

  

  

  

 the determination to provide support to particular products from time to time may reduce earnings or other investments in the business 

blackrock may at its option from time to time support investment products through capital or credit support see for example “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” such support utilizes capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes losses on such support or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products could have an adverse impact on revenues and earnings 

changes in the value levels of the capital markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in the value of investments that blackrock owns 

at december 31 2010 blackrock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately 10 billion in these investments see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is primarily the result of coinvestments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds a decline in the prices of stocks or bonds or the value of real estate or other alternative investments within or outside the united states could lower the value of these investments and result in a decline of nonoperating income and an increase in the volatility of our earnings 

continued capital losses on investments could have adverse income tax consequences 

the company may generate realized and unrealized capital losses on seed investments and coinvestments realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes the company has unrealized capital losses for which a deferred tax asset has been established in the event such unrealized losses are realized the company may not be able to offset such losses within the carryback or carryforward period or from future realized capital gains in which case the deferred tax asset will not be realized the failure to utilize the deferred tax asset could materially increase blackrock’s income tax expense 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect blackrock 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships blackrock and the products and accounts that it manages have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose blackrock or the funds and accounts that it manages to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely impact blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

  

   

the failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to reduced aum in similar products of blackrock without regard to the performance of blackrock’s products 

the failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products of blackrock without regard to the performance of blackrock’s products such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on our aum revenues and earnings 

loss of employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

the ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to blackrock’s growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients the market for qualified fund managers investment analysts financial advisers and other professionals is competitive there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel loss of personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

separate account and commingled trust clients may terminate their investment management contracts with blackrock or withdraw funds on short notice the company has from time to time lost separate accounts and could in the future lose accounts or significant aum under various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance 

additionally blackrock manages its us mutual funds closedend funds and exchangedtraded funds under management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds’ boards of directors annually a majority of the directors of each such fund are independent from blackrock consequently there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund managed by the company will approve the fund’s management contract each year or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the company  

further the governing agreements of many of the company’s private investment funds generally provide that subject to certain conditions investors in those funds and in some cases independent directors of those funds may remove the investment adviser general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote resulting in a reduction in the management or performance fees as well as the total carried interest blackrock could earn 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against blackrock and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

when clients retain blackrock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf they specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the company is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to blackrock’s reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their aum or terminating their contracts any of which could cause the company’s revenues and earnings to decline 

competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins 

the investment management industry including the offering of exchangetraded funds is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry to the extent that the company is forced to compete on the basis of price it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline 

  

   

performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments performance fees represented 540 million or 6 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing earnings to be more volatile 

additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position 

blackrock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins these strategies have included smallersized liftouts of investment teams and acquisitions of investment management businesses such as the mlim quellos and bgi transactions these strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position in the investment management industry in the event blackrock pursues additional acquisitions it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from such acquisitions 

risks related to blackrock’s operations 

failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the company’s infrastructure including its technological capacity data centers and office space is vital to the competitiveness of its business the failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business including any expansion could impede the company’s productivity and growth which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

failure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on blackrock and its products 

a significant portion of blackrock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas including san francisco california new york new york and london england a major earthquake fire terrorist or other catastrophic event could result in disruption to the business the failure of the company to maintain updated adequate business continuity plans including backup facilities could impede the company’s ability to operate upon a disruption which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

operating in international markets increases blackrock’s operational regulatory and other risks 

as a result of blackrock’s extensive international business activities the company faces increased operational regulatory reputational and foreign exchange rate risks the failure of the company’s systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

  

   

failure to maintain a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

a key element to blackrock’s continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into blackrock’s aladdin technology platform that support investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients moreover the company’s technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data the failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes 

failure to implement effective information security policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in blackrock’s earnings or stock price 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information security policies procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a hacker attack virus or worm or an internally caused issue such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause a decline in the company’s earnings or stock price 

the failure of a key vendor to blackrock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on blackrock and its products 

blackrock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration custody and transfer agent roles and other operational needs the failure or inability of blackrock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational issues for the company and in certain products which could result in financial losses for the company and its clients 

the remaining integration of the bgi business creates risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect profitability 

a portion of the bgi business and personnel remain in the process of being integrated with blackrock’s previously existing business and personnel these transition activities are complex and the company may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs including 

 

  

  

  

 as a result the company may not be able to realize all of the benefits that it hoped to achieve from the transaction in addition blackrock may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on the development and expansion of its business and services 

  

   

failure to manage risks in operating blackrock’s securities lending program for clients could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues and liquidity 

the size of blackrock’s securities lending programs increased significantly with the completion of the bgi transaction as part of these programs blackrock must manage risks associated with i ensuring that the value of the collateral held against the securities on loan does not decline in value or become illiquid and that its nature and value complies with regulatory requirements and investment requirements ii the potential that a borrower defaults or does not return a loaned security on a timely basis iii the potential that the collateral held may not be sufficient to repurchase the loaned security and iv errors in the settlement of securities daily marktomarket valuations and collateral collection the failure of the company’s controls to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for our clients that participate in our securities lending programs as well as for the company 

risks related to relationships with bank of americamerrill lynch pnc barclays and other institutional investors 

merrill lynch is an important distributor of blackrock’s products and the company is therefore subject to risks associated with the business of merrill lynch 

under a global distribution agreement entered into with merrill lynch merrill lynch provides distribution portfolio administration and servicing for certain blackrock investment management products and services through its various distribution channels the company may not be successful in distributing products through merrill lynch or in distributing its products and services through other third party distributors if blackrock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distributionrelated costs blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 

loss of market share within merrill lynch’s global wealth  investment management business could harm operating results 

a significant portion of blackrock’s revenue has historically come from aum generated by merrill lynch’s global wealth  investment management “gwim” business blackrock’s ability to maintain a strong relationship within gwim is material to the company’s future performance if one of the company’s competitors gains significant additional market share within the gwim retail channel at the expense of blackrock then blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted 

the failure of barclays to fulfill its commitments or the inadequacy of the support provided under certain capital support agreements in favor of a number of cash management funds acquired in the bgi transaction could negatively impact such funds and blackrock 

barclays has provided capital support agreements through december 2013 or until certain criteria are met to support certain cash management products which were acquired by blackrock in the bgi transaction the failure of barclays to fulfill its obligations under these agreements or the inadequacy of the support provided could cause our clients to suffer losses and blackrock to suffer reputational and other adverse impacts for a discussion on the capital support agreements see “management discussion and analysis – liquidity and capital resources – barclays support of certain cash funds” 

  

   

pnc and barclays have each agreed to vote as stockholders in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of bank of americamerrill lynch pnc and barclays 

pnc and barclays have agreed to vote all of their voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors in accordance with the provisions of their respective stockholder agreements with blackrock as a consequence if the shares held by pnc and barclays constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval including elections of directors will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determinations of the blackrock board of directors this arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over blackrock in its board of directors whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the board at december 31 2010 pnc and barclays owned approximately 253 and 23 respectively of blackrock’s voting common stock 

a large portion of our capital stock is held by a small group of significant shareholders future sales of our common stock in the public market by us or our large stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

the dfa and its regulations and other new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations could adversely impact the scope or profitability of blackrock’s business activities could require blackrock to change certain business practices and could expose blackrock to additional costs including compliance and tax costs and liabilities as well as reputational harm regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions could adversely impact the value of assets in which blackrock has invested on behalf of clients andor via seed or coinvestments and to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms could make it more difficult for blackrock to conduct certain business activities or distinguish itself from competitors 

  

   

failure to comply with the advisers act and the investment company act and related regulations could result in substantial harm to blackrock’s reputation and results of operations 

certain blackrock subsidiaries are registered with the sec under the advisers act and blackrock’s us mutual funds and exchangetraded funds are registered with the sec under the investment company act the advisers act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers including recordkeeping operating and marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes similar obligations as well as additional detailed operational requirements on investment advisers to registered investment companies the failure of any of blackrock’s subsidiaries to comply with the advisers act or the investment company act could cause the sec to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts including censure termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to secregistered funds and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the company’s reputation any of which could cause its earnings or stock price to decline 

failure to comply with erisa regulations could result in penalties and cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

certain blackrock subsidiaries are subject to erisa and to regulations promulgated thereunder insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under erisa with respect to benefit plan clients erisa and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa prohibit specified transactions involving erisa plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions the failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce the company’s earnings or cause its stock price to decline 

blackrock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities 

because the total equity ownership interest of each of bank of america and pnc in blackrock exceeds or until recently exceeded certain thresholds blackrock is deemed to be a nonbank subsidiary of each of bank of america and pnc which are both financial holding companies under the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended as a nonbank subsidiary of each of bank of america and pnc blackrock is subject to banking regulation including the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that blackrock may conduct the federal reserve has broad enforcement authority over blackrock including the power to prohibit blackrock from conducting any activity that in the federal reserve’s opinion is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting blackrock’s business and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations any failure of either bank of america or pnc to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain blackrock activities and its growth in addition blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary is subject to regulation by the occ which is similar in many respects to that imposed under the advisers act and the investment company act as described above and to capital requirements established by the occ the occ has broad enforcement authority over blackrock’s trust bank subsidiary being subject to banking regulation may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations in the united kingdom other member states of the european union hong kong japan australia and other nonus jurisdictions in which blackrock operates could result in substantial harm to blackrock’s reputation and results of operations 

the financial services authority the “fsa” regulates blackrock’s subsidiaries in the united kingdom authorization by the fsa is required to conduct any financial servicesrelated business in the united kingdom under the financial services and markets act 2000 the fsa’s rules govern a firm’s capital resources requirements senior management arrangements conduct of business interaction with clients and systems and controls breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the company’s ukregulated subsidiaries 

  

   

in addition these subsidiaries and other european subsidiaries branches or representative offices must comply with the paneuropean regime established by the markets in financial instruments directive which regulates the provision of investment services throughout the european economic area as well as the capital requirements directive which delineates regulatory capital requirements as discussed under “businessregulation” in the aftermath of the financial crisis the european commission set out a detailed plan to complete the eu’s financial reform outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives regulations and recommendations there are changes proposed by the alternative investment fund managers directive to be implemented by the summer of 2013 and ucits iv which is required to be adopted in the national law of each eu member state by july 1 2011 there are also european commission consultations in process regarding certain insurance wrap products referred to in the united kingdom as packaged retail investment products covering precontractual information to be provided with respect to such products and ucits v which addresses among other items custodial liability in the united kingdom the bribery act 2010 was to be implemented in april 2011 but has been put on hold while the uk government rewrites guidance for businesses on how to comply with its provisions when in force it is likely to impose additional procedures on the company’s ukregulated subsidiaries in addition a retail distribution review initiated by the fsa is expected to change how investment advice is paid for in the united kingdom for all investment products final retail distribution rules are expected in early 2011 with implementation to occur by the end of 2012 

in japan certain blackrock subsidiaries are subject to the financial instruments and exchange law the “fiel” and the law concerning investment trusts and investment corporations these laws are administered and enforced by the japanese financial services agency the “jfsa” which establishes standards for compliance including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules the jfsa is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure fines the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the fiel 

in australia blackrock’s subsidiaries are subject to various australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the australian securities and investments commission the “asic” and the australian prudential regulation authority the asic regulates companies and financial services in australia and is responsible for promoting investor creditor and consumer protection failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation suspension or variation of the relevant subsidiaries’ licenses in australia 

the activities of certain blackrock subsidiaries in hong kong are subject to the securities and futures ordinance the “sfo” which governs the securities and futures markets and the nonbank retail leveraged foreign exchange market in hong kong the sfo is administered by the securities and futures commission the “sfc” an independent nongovernmental body the relevant subsidiaries and certain individuals representing them which conduct business in any of the regulated activities specified in the sfo are generally required to be registered or licensed with the sfc and are subject to the rules codes and guidelines issued by the sfc from time to time 

there are similar legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other nonus jurisdictions where blackrock’s subsidiaries conduct business or where the funds and products it manages are organized failure to comply with laws and regulations in any of these jurisdictions could result in substantial harm to blackrock’s reputation and results of operation 

legal proceedings could adversely affect operating results and financial condition for a particular period 

many aspects of blackrock’s business involve substantial risks of legal liability the company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with blackrock’s activities from time to time blackrock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various us and nonus governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industrywide companyspecific or other investigations or proceedings additionally certain of the investment funds that the company manages are subject to lawsuits any of which could potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages

management after consultation with legal counsel currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability if any arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on blackrock’s earnings financial position or cash flows although at the present time management is not in a position to determine whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material adverse effect on blackrock’s results of operations in any future reporting period

blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” however management believes that evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap basis financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators for both management and investors of blackrock’s financial performance over time blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 

certain prior period nongaap data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation computations for all periods are derived from the company’s consolidated statements of income as follows 

 

 operating income as adjusted equals operating income gaap basis excluding certain items deemed nonrecurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value as indicated in the table below operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and commissions operating margin as adjusted equals operating income used for operating margin measurement divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement as indicated in the table below

management believes that operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s financial performance over time as such management believes that operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted provide useful disclosure to investors 

operating income as adjusted 

bgi transaction and integration costs recorded in 2010 and 2009 consist principally of certain advisory payments compensation expense legal fees marketing and promotional occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the bgi transaction restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008 consist of compensation costs occupancy costs and professional fees the expenses associated with restructuring and bgi transaction and integration costs have been deemed nonrecurring by management and have been excluded from operating income as adjusted to help enhance the comparability of this information to the current reporting periods as such management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating blackrock’s operating performance for the respective periods 

the portion of compensation expense associated with certain longterm incentive plans “ltip” that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of blackrock stock held by pnc and a merrill lynch cash compensation contribution a portion of which has been received have been excluded because these charges ultimately do not impact blackrock’s book value 

compensation expense associated with appreciationdepreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans which substantially offset this expense are reported in nonoperating income expense 

operating margin as adjusted 

operating income used for measuring operating margin as adjusted is equal to operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and commissions management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the company’s results until future periods 

operating margin as adjusted allows the company to compare performance from periodtoperiod by adjusting for items that may not recur recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements such as restructuring charges transaction and integration costs closedend fund launch costs commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctuations in compensation expense based on marktomarket movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans the company also uses operating margin as adjusted to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance to other companies management uses both the gaap and nongaap financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of blackrock the nongaap measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the company’s revenues and expenses 

revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties management believes that excluding such costs is useful to blackrock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services which due to the terms of the contracts are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time offset distribution fee revenue earned by the company reimbursable property management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of metric property management inc “metric” a subsidiary of blackrock realty advisors inc “realty” prior to the transfer in 2008 these employees were retained on metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by realty’s clients the related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted because they did not bear an economic cost to blackrock for each of these items blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues

 management believes that nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock’s nonoperating contribution to its results as compensation expense associated with appreciationdepreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans which is included in operating income offsets the gainloss on the investments set aside for these plans management believes that nonoperating income expense less net income loss attributable to nci as adjusted provides a useful measure for both management and investors of blackrock’s nonoperating results that impact book value

during third quarter 2010 and third quarter 2009 the united kingdom and new york city respectively enacted legislation reducing corporate income tax rates which resulted in a revaluation of certain net deferred tax liabilities primarily related to acquired intangible assets the resulting decrease in income taxes has been excluded from net income attributable to blackrock inc as adjusted as these were nonrecurring enacted tax legislation changes that do not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability of this information to the reporting periods

  aum increased approximately 215 billion or 6 to 3561 trillion at december 31 2010 compared to 3346 trillion at december 31 2009 the growth in aum was primarily attributable to 267 billion in net market appreciation 131 billion of net subscriptions in longterm mandates and 17 billion increase due to foreign exchange movements partially offset by 127 billion of bgi mergerrelated outflows due to manager concentration considerations and active equity quantitative performance and acquisition adjustments 61 billion of net outflows in cash management products and 12 billion of net client distributions in advisory assignments 

net market appreciation of 267 billion included 191 billion of net appreciation in equity products due to an increase in global equity markets 55 billion in fixed income products due to current income and changes in interest rate spreads 14 billion in multiasset class products and 7 billion in alternatives primarily due to appreciation in precious metals including silver and gold 

the 17 billion net increase in aum from converting nonus dollar denominated aum into us dollars was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the japanese yen canadian dollar and australian dollar partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and pound sterling

contingent payments related to business acquisitions 

in connection with the quellos transaction quellos was entitled to receive two contingent payments subject to achieving certain investment advisory base and performance fee measures through december 31 2010 totaling up to an additional 969 million in a combination of cash and stock 

during second quarter 2009 the company determined the amount of the first contingent payment to be 219 million of which 11 million was previously paid in cash during 2008 of the remaining 208 million during second quarter 2009 156 million was paid in cash and 52 million was paid in common stock or approximately 330000 shares based on a price of 15733 per share 

the second contingent payment of up to 595 million would have been payable in cash in 2011 quellos also was entitled to a “catchup” payment in 2011 if certain investment advisory base fee measures were met through 2010 as the value of the first contingent payment was less than 374 million a portion of the second contingent payment not to exceed 90 million would have been paid to quellos based on factors including the continued employment of certain employees with blackrock 

the base and performance fee measures through december 31 2010 were not achieved therefore the remaining contingent payments will not occur

the following items have not been included in the contractual obligations commitments and contingencies table 

compensation and benefit obligations 

the company has various compensation and benefit obligations including bonuses commissions and incentive payments payable defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations and deferred compensation arrangements that are excluded from the table above primarily due to uncertainties in their payout periods these arrangements are discussed in more detail in notes 15 stockbased compensation and 16 employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k accrued compensation and benefits at december 31 2010 totaled 1520 million and included incentive compensation of 1220 million deferred compensation of 89 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of 211 million substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2011 while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over periods up to five years 

separate account liabilities 

the company’s two whollyowned registered life insurance companies in the united kingdom maintain separate account assets representing segregated funds held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts the net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to these separate account assets accrue to the contract owners and as such an offsetting separate account liability is recorded at december 31 2010 the company had 1211 billion of assets and offsetting liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition the payment of these contractual obligations is inherently uncertain and varies by customer as such these liabilities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

indemnifications 

in many of the company’s contracts including the bgi mlim and quellos transaction agreements blackrock agrees to indemnify third parties under certain circumstances the terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability if any cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in the company’s consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31 2010 see further discussion in note 14 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k 

  

 

   

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies as well as recent accounting developments see note 2 significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k 

consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products 

consolidation of sponsored investment funds and securitization products collectively “investment products” is determined pursuant to asc 810 consolidation  the accounting method used by the company is dependent upon the influence the company has over its investee the investment product to the extent that blackrock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investment product which generally exists if there is a 50 or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights the investment product is consolidated into blackrock’s financial statements 

for investment products in which blackrock’s voting interest is less than 50 an analysis is performed to determine if the investment product is a variable interest entity “vie” or a voting rights entity upon the determination that the investment product is a vie further analysis as discussed below is performed to determine if blackrock is the primary beneficiary “pb” of the investment product which would result in consolidation 

consolidation of variable interest entities 

pursuant to asc 81010 certain investment products for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests may be deemed vies blackrock reviews factors including the rights of the equity holders and obligations of equity holders to absorb losses or receive expected residual returns to determine if the investment product is a vie blackrock is required to consolidate a vie when it is deemed to be the pb which is evaluated continuously as facts and circumstances change 

in june 2009 the fasb issued asu 200917 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities “asu 200917” which became effective for blackrock on january 1 2010 in february 2010 the fasb issued asu 201010 amendments to statement 167 for certain investment funds “asu 201010”  this asu deferred the application of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r to a reporting enterprise’s interest in vies if certain conditions are met 

the pb of a vie that is an investment fund meeting the conditions of asu 201010 is the enterprise that absorbs the majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests including those of related parties effective january 1 2010 the pb of a vie that does not meet the conditions for deferral in asu 201010 is the enterprise that has the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie

consolidation of variable interest entities continued 

  

significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the company is the pb of a vie if the company together with its related parties is determined to be the pb of a vie the entity will be consolidated within blackrock’s consolidated financial statements in order to determine whether the company is the pb of a vie for entities that do meet the conditions of asu 201010 management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios assumptions made in such analyses include but are not limited to market prices of securities market interest rates potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities gain realization liquidity or marketability of certain securities discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes 

in the normal course of business the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles including collateralized debtloan obligations “cdos” or “clos” that do not meet the conditions of asu 201010 and sponsored investment funds which may be considered vies at december 31 2010 the company consolidated four vies including three clos and one sponsored private equity fund at december 31 2010 the following balances related to these four vies were consolidated on the company’s consolidated statement of financial condition 

 

 as of december 31 2010 blackrock was the manager of over 20 closcdos and other securitization entities including the three aforementioned clos in which blackrock in accordance with asu 200917 was determined to be the pb which resulted in consolidation of these vies in the company’s consolidated financial statements blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities of the clo that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie at december 31 2010 the company had 1360 million and 1285 million in assets and liabilities respectively on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to these consolidated clos in addition the company recorded appropriated retained earnings for the difference as the clo noteholders not blackrock ultimately will receive the benefits or absorb the losses associated with the clo’s assets and liabilities therefore the changes in the assets and liabilities of these clos have no impact on net income attributable to blackrock inc or its cash flows

consolidation of variable interest entities continued 

  

at of december 31 2010 blackrock was determined to be the pb of one sponsored private equity investment fund of funds in which it had a nonsubstantive investment and was deemed to absorb the majority of the variability due to its defacto third party relationships with other partners in the fund which limits the ability of the partners to transfer or sell their interests without blackrock’s consent as the general partner of the fund at december 31 2010 the company had recorded 11 million 34 million and 45 million in cash and cash equivalents private equity investments and nonredeemable noncontrolling interests of consolidated vies respectively on its consolidated statement of financial condition related to this vie the company has no risk of loss with its involvement with this vie therefore the changes in the assets and liabilities of this vie have no impact on net income attributable to blackrock inc 

consolidation of voting rights entities 

to the extent that blackrock maintains 50 or greater voting interest of an investment product blackrock is deemed to have control of the product which results in consolidation of the product into blackrock’s financial statements 

the company as general partner or managing member of certain sponsored investment funds generally is presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies pursuant to asc 81020 control of partnerships and similar entities “asc 81020” the company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other nonaffiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the investment vehicle or otherwise to remove blackrock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote or have other substantive participating rights if the investment vehicle is not a vie and the presumption of control is not overcome the investment vehicle will be consolidated into blackrock’s financial statements 

  

 

   

critical accounting policies continued 

  

consolidation of voting rights entities continued 

  

at december 31 2010 and 2009 as a result of consolidation of various investment products deemed to be voting rights entities including products where blackrock owns 50 of greater of the voting rights of the product under the consolidation policies described above the company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition 

 

 the company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to asc 81010 at december 31 2009 the above balances included a consolidated sponsored investment fund that also was deemed a vie at december 31 2010 and is currently reported within assets and liabilities of consolidated vies on the consolidated statement of financial condition this vie as well as three clos which are also vies was excluded from the december 31 2010 balances above as commencing in 2010 these balances are reported separately on the consolidated statement of financial condition 

investments 

equity method investments 

for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where the company is not the pb of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company uses the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity

equity method investments continued 

  

substantially all of blackrock’s equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value therefore under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income expense for investments in investment companies or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments which are recorded in other assets since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be connected to blackrock’s core business 

at december 31 2010 the company had 583 million and 58 million of equity method investments including equity method investments held for deferred compensation reflected within investments and other assets respectively and at december 31 2009 the company had 401 million and 36 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets respectively 

impairment of investments 

the company’s management periodically assesses its equity method availableforsale heldtomaturity and cost investments for impairment if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist investments are evaluated using market values where available or the expected future cash flows of the investment if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the company’s carrying value of the investment an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statement of income 

when the fair value of an availableforsale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value the company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “otherthantemporary” 

in making this determination for equity securities the company considers among other factors the length of time the security has been in a loss position the extent to which the security’s market value is less than its cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses if the impairment is considered otherthantemporary a charge is recorded to the consolidated statement of income 

in making this determination for debt securities the company considers whether 1 the company has the intent to sell the security 2 it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery or 3 the company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security if the company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered a credit loss the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total impairment and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in other comprehensive income

impairment of investments continued 

  

for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the company recorded otherthantemporary impairments of less than 1 million 5 million and 8 million respectively related to debt securities and cdo availableforsale investments which were recorded in nonoperating income expense on the consolidated statements of income 

the 5 million of impairments in 2009 included 2 million related to credit loss impairments on debt securities the 2 million credit loss impairment in 2009 was determined by comparing the estimated discounted cash flows versus the amortized cost for each individual security the otherthantemporary impairments related to debt securities were due to adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses 

evaluation of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated statements of income 

fair value measurements 

blackrock adopted the applicable provisions of asc 82010 fair value measurements and disclosures “asc 82010” as of january 1 2008 which require among other things enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value 

hierarchy of fair value inputs 

the provisions of asc 82010 establish a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to the fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs additionally companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the level 3 category which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities 

assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories 

level 1 inputs 

quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date 

 

   

 

   

critical accounting policies continued 

  

fair value measurements continued 

  

level 2 inputs 

quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active quotes from pricing services or brokers for which the company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price were observable and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as models or other valuation methodologies 

 

 level 3 inputs 

unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability which may include nonbinding broker quotes level 3 assets include investments for which there is little if any market activity these inputs require significant management judgment or estimation certain investments that are valued using net asset values and that are subject to current redemption restrictions that will not be lifted in the near term are included in level 3 

 

  

 level 3 inputs include blackrock capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments blackrock’s 650 million of level 3 investments at december 31 2010 primarily include coinvestments in private equity fund of funds and private equity funds funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities and real estate equity products many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund which could include blackrock employees fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricingvaluation information including independent appraisals from third party sources however in some instances current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable in these instances fund management may perform modelbased analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments 

  

 

   

critical accounting policies continued 

  

fair value measurements continued 

  

significance of inputs 

the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument 

pricing services and broker quotes 

a significant amount of inputs used to value equity and debt securities are sourced from wellrecognized third party pricing vendors generally prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as level 1 inputs for securities that are traded in active markets and as level 2 for other securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price annually blackrock reviews both the valuation methodology including the general assumptions and methods used to value various asset classes and operational process with these vendors in addition on a quarterly basis meetings are held with the vendors to identify any significant changes to the vendors’ process 

in addition quotes obtained from brokers generally are nonbinding and categorized as level 3 inputs however if the company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable the quote is classified as a level 2 input 

significant transfers into and out of levels 1 2 and 3 

during the year ended december 31 2010 the company reclassified approximately 47 million of net investments out of level 3 predominantly to level 2 the majority of the net reclassifications were related to investments that company values using a nav or a capital account and it currently has the ability to redeem in the near term 

changes in valuation 

changes in value on 1051 million of investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense 45 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income 431 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining 13 million related to carried interest has no impact on nonoperating income expense as of december 31 2010 changes in fair value of approximately 397 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will impact blackrock’s net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is 260 million

goodwill and intangible assets 

at december 31 2010 the carrying amounts of the company’s goodwill and intangible assets were as follows 

 

   

 

   

critical accounting policies continued 

  

goodwill and intangible assets continued 

  

the value of contracts acquired in a business acquisition to manage assets in proprietary open and closedend investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinitelived intangible asset the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with the applicable provisions of asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other “asc 350” indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives which at december 31 2010 ranged from 3 years to 14 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 63 years 

goodwill 

the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company the impairment test performed as of july 31 2010 indicated no impairment charge was required the company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2010 the company’s common stock closed at 19058 which exceeded its book value per share of approximately 13609 after excluding appropriated retained earnings 

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles 

the company assesses its indefinitelived management contracts trade names and licenses for impairment at least annually considering various factors including aum growth rates product mix product margins tax rates discount rates and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each intangible asset are impaired and whether the indefinitelife classification is still appropriate the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows the fair value of finitelived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment in addition if such circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform an impairment test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis if the asset is determined to be impaired the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs actual results could differ from these estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion 

in 2010 2009 and 2008 the company performed impairment tests that indicated no impairment charges were required the classification of indefinitelived versus finitelived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles were required the company continuously monitors various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment

goodwill and intangible assets continued 

  

indefinitelived and finitelived intangibles continued 

  

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finitelived intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 160 million 147 million and 146 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by asc 740 income taxes  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

blackrock adopted the applicable provisions of asc 740 on january 1 2007 related to uncertainties in income taxes which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements asc 740 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return asc 740 also provides guidance on among other things derecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 

the application of asc 740 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes which require significant management judgment actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2010 blackrock had 307 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 194 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

  

 

   

critical accounting policies continued 

  

income taxes continued 

  

in accordance with asc 740 management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2010 the company had net deferred tax assets of 10 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately 5477 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company asc 740 requires the company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

at december 31 2010 the company has recorded a deferred tax asset of 108 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized hold certain equity method investments which include fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized however changes in circumstance could cause the company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change such changes may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements see note 21 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for further details 

the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivable of approximately 57 million and current income taxes payable of 157 million at december 31 2010

revenue recognition 

investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed such fees are based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or in the case of certain real estate separate accounts net operating income generated by the underlying properties and are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions 

the company contracts with third parties including related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain nonus funds managed by the company such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund in certain cases the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that blackrock bears no credit risk to the third party the company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with asc 60545 revenue recognition – principle agent considerations “asc 60545” and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions retrocessions for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were 831 million 611 million and 762 million respectively the company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which due to the terms of the contracts are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income 

the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients primarily to brokerage institutions such revenues are accounted for on an accrual basis the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash and securities generally ranging from 102 to 112 of the value of the loaned securities the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or other thirdparty accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 securities lending revenue totaled 325 million 36 million and 25 million respectively and is recorded in investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income 

investment advisory administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee 

the company also may receive performance fees or incentive allocations from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts which are primarily alternative equity or multiasset class products these performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement periods which vary by product or account and could be monthly quarterly annually or longer for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 performance fee revenue totaled 540 million 202 million and 177 million respectively

in addition the company may receive carried interest in the form of an investment capital allocation or cash from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds however blackrock may be required to return all or part of such carried interest depending upon performance of these investment products in future periods therefore blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments or cash to the extent that it is distributed on its consolidated statements of financial condition carried interest is realized upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable the company records realized carried interest as performance fees on its consolidated statements of income the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2010 and 2009 the company had 23 million and 13 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition the ultimate recognition of revenue if any for these products is unknown 

fees earned for blackrock solutions  which include advisory services are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some or all of the following methods i fixed fees ii percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and iii performance fees if contractual thresholds are met revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of onetime advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on aum of the respective portfolio assignment for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 blackrock solutions and advisory revenue totaled 460 million 477 million and 393 million respectively 

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on the fair value of aum and since the company does not record performance revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend aum market price risk 

blackrock’s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on aum at december 31 2010 the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end aum of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts movements in equity market prices interest ratescredit spreads foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of aum to decline which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees 

corporate investments portfolio risks 

as a leading investment management firm blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying measuring monitoring managing and analyzing market and operating risks including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio the board of directors of the company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the company requiring among other things that all investments be reviewed by the company’s capital committee which consists of senior officers of the company and that certain investments may be referred to the audit committee or the board of directors depending on the circumstances for approval 

in the normal course of its business blackrock is exposed to equity market price risk interest ratecredit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments 

blackrock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate private equity and hedge funds investments generally are made for coinvestment purposes to establish a performance track record to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes currently the company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments at december 31 2010 the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately 25 million 

  

 

   

corporate investments portfolio risks 

at december 31 2010 approximately 397 million of blackrock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by blackrock in accordance with gaap and therefore are consolidated even though blackrock may not own a majority of such funds excluding the impact of the federal reserve bank stock carried interest investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain equity investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program the company’s net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows

the net “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the equity market price or the interest ratecredit spread risk disclosures below 

equity market price risk 

at december 31 2010 the company’s net exposure to market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately 544 million of the company’s net economic investment exposure investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments hedge funds and fund of funds as well as mutual funds the company estimates that a 10 adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately 544 million in the carrying value of such investments 

interest ratecredit spread risk 

at december 31 2010 the company was exposed to interestrate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately 420 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments in the aggregate would result in a decrease or increase of approximately 7 million in the carrying value of such investments 

foreign exchange rate risk 

as discussed above the company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes the carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies primarily the pound sterling euro south korean won and taiwan dollars was 118 million a 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately an 118 million decline in the carrying value of such investments

  see additional information in item 6 selected financial data 

blackrock reports its financial results using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” however management believes that evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap basis financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators for both management and investors of blackrock’s financial performance over time blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap certain prior year nongaap financial measures have been restated to conform to current year presentation 

  

 overview continued 

  

operating income as adjusted 

gaap reported operating income includes all compensation related expenses associated with certain of blackrock’s longterm incentive plans “ltip” which are partially funded by blackrock stock currently held by pnc and by anticipated capital contributions from merrill lynch certain costs related to the integration of the mlim and quellos transactions in 2006 and 2007 certain costs associated with the ssr transaction in 2005 a 2007 termination fee for closedend fund administration and servicing arrangements with merrill lynch a 2008 restructuring charge and compensation expense associated with appreciation  depreciation on assets related to blackrock’s deferred compensation plans 

operating income as adjusted a nongaap measure excludes the expense related to the 2008 restructuring charges the 2007 termination of the closedend fund administration and servicing arrangements with merrill lynch and mlim and quellos integration costs consisting principally of certain professional fees rebranding costs and compensation costs incurred in conjunction with the integration these expenses have been excluded from operating income as adjusted because they have been deemed nonrecurring by management and to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods the portion of expense associated with ltip that will be funded through blackrock common stock held by pnc and the anticipated merrill lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of ltip participants’ put options primarily in the three months ended march 31 2007 these charges do not impact blackrock’s book value a detailed discussion of the ltip is included in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on assets related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments directed for these plans are reported in nonoperating income expense management believes that operating income exclusive of these costs are more representative of the operating performance for the respective periods 

operating margin as adjusted 

operating income used for measuring operating margin as adjusted is equal to operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and commissions management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the company’s results until future periods 

revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes portfolio administration and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties management believes that excluding such costs is useful because the company receives offsetting revenue for these services amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions are excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time offset distribution fee revenue earned by the company reimbursable property management compensation was excluded from operating margin as adjusted as it represents compensation and benefits paid to personnel of metric property management inc “metric” a subsidiary of blackrock realty advisors inc “realty” which is fully reimbursed by realty’s clients resulting in no economic cost to blackrock 

nonoperating income expense net of noncontrolling interests as adjusted 

nonoperating income expense net of noncontrolling interests as adjusted equals nonoperating income expense gaap basis net of noncontrolling interests gaap basis adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation appreciation on assets related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans which is recorded in operating income this compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income expense net of noncontrolling interests as adjusted to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans which are reported in nonoperating income expense gaap basis 

  

 overview continued 

  

nonoperating income expense net of noncontrolling interests as adjusted continued 

management believes that nonoperating income expense as adjusted provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock’s nonoperating contribution to its results as compensation expense on the deferred compensation plans which is included in operating income offsets the gainloss on the investments set aside for these plans management believes that nonoperating income expense net of noncontrolling interests as adjusted provides useful measures to investors of blackrock’s nonoperating results 

net income as adjusted 

gaap reported net income and gaap diluted earnings per share include certain significant items the aftertax impact of which management considers nonrecurring or ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value and therefore are excluded in calculating net income as adjusted 

net income and diluted earnings per share as adjusted a nongaap measure exclude the aftertax impact of the 2008 restructuring charges the 2007 termination of closedend fund administration and servicing arrangements with merrill lynch ltip expense to be funded by pnc and by an expected merrill lynch compensation contribution mlim quellos and ssr integration costs and the effect on deferred income tax expense attributable to corporate income tax rate reductions

blackrock manages a range of equity strategies across the riskreturn spectrum including global and regional portfolios value growth and core mandates large mid and small cap strategies and selected sector funds amidst particularly volatile conditions and challenging markets for equity managers blackrock’s application of risk analytics to equity portfolio construction helped managers reposition their portfolios effectively for the new environment 

blackrock’s equity and balanced aum closed the year at 2808 billion the sharp fall in global equity markets caused aum to decline 1604 billion or 35 since december 31 2007 foreign exchange translation accounted for an additional 188 billion or 4 decay in reported aum despite the challenging market environment the company attracted 09 billion of net new business during the year with inflows in asset allocation and index products partially offset by outflows in sector funds us equity and emerging market portfolios blackrock’s equity investment teams achieved strong relative performance with 70 85 and 91 of equity fund assets ranked in the top two peer group quartiles for the one three and fiveyear periods ended december 31 2008 

at yearend 2008 49 of the company’s equity and balanced aum or 1364 billion were managed for us investors and 51 or 1444 billion were managed for international investors in over 35 countries in addition blackrock’s channel mix was well balanced with 53 of assets managed on behalf of institutional clients and 47 managed on behalf of retail and high net worth investors during 2008 we were awarded 109 billion and 30 billion of net new business from us retail and institutional investors respectively these inflows were offset by net outflows of 70 billion from international retail investors and 59 billion from us high net worth investors principally in brokersold separately managed accounts

fixed income 

blackrock offers an array of fixed income products across currencies sectors and maturities portfolios can be tailored relative to clients’ liabilities accounting regulatory or rating agency requirements or other investment policies in 2008 investors worldwide sought the safety of governmentguaranteed debt particularly late in the year in the face of extreme market disruption and deteriorating economic conditions clients continued to migrate from broad bond market portfolios and structured products to long duration and other liability driven strategies widespread deleveraging of balance sheets caused significant devaluation of assets which in turn led to demand for advisory services and investor interest in a variety of distressed and opportunistic products 

blackrock’s fixed income aum ended the year at 4832 billion a decrease of 298 billion or 6 yearoveryear a substantial majority of this decline 78 or 232 billion resulted from adverse market movements primarily in the form of dramatic widening of credit spreads as liquidity dried up net outflows accounted for the remaining 66 billion or 1 falloff in aum driven by investors’ cash needs structured product liquidations a shift toward liability driven investing and insourcing following a single client’s merger activity the year was exceptionally challenging for bond managers and blackrock was not immune although we remained competitive within our institutional peer group investment performance fell short of our expectations particularly in multisector portfolios for the one three and fiveyear periods ended december 31 2008 37 36 and 45 of bond fund assets ranked in the top two peer group quartiles 

blackrock’s fixed income client base remains largely institutional with 86 of aum or 4158 billion managed on behalf of institutional clients and 14 or 674 billion managed for retail and high net worth investors net inflows of 114 billion from international clients were overwhelmed by net outflows of 180 billion from us investors resulting in a slight shift in the client mix from 35 international at yearend 2007 to 36 at yearend 2008 

cash management 

the cash management industry was particularly challenged by the credit and liquidity crisis that persisted throughout 2008 difficulties intensified in the third quarter when the bankruptcy of lehman brothers caused the reserve primary fund’s net asset value to drop below 1 thereby becoming the second fund ever to “break the buck” in the nearly 40year history of money market mutual funds this landmark event triggered large redemptions in prime money market funds as investors sought safety in treasuries and government money market funds this massive “flight to safety” necessitated substantial selling by prime funds which in turn froze shortterm funding markets until government intervention encouraged investors to reallocate back into prime money market funds 

throughout the year blackrock navigated these extraordinary market conditions to ensure safety and liquidity for our cash management clients flows were volatile particularly in the third and fourth quarters when the company’s liquidity products had net outflows of 535 billion and net inflows of 486 billion respectively cash management aum closed the year at 3384 billion an increase of 8 or 251 billion since yearend 2007 for the yearended december 31 2008 average assets were approximately 26 higher than for calendar year 2007 

blackrock’s cash management activities are primarily conducted on behalf of us investors with increasing demand from international clients especially in the united kingdom and middle east at december 31 2008 cash management aum for us investors reached 2977 billion up 4 from 2007 and 407 billion for international clients up 52 from a year ago for the first time net inflows from international clients surpassed net subscriptions from us investors 151 billion and 106 billion respectively blackrock’s cash management clientele remains largely institutional with 3092 billion or 91 managed on behalf of institutions and 292 billion or 9 managed on behalf of retail and high net worth investors

cash management continued 

management expects continued volatility in cash management flows given ongoing dislocations in the market and the extremely low level of rates on treasury bills and other money market instruments 

alternatives 

blackrock’s alternative investment capabilities include real estate equity and debt hedge fund private equity and real asset funds of funds singlestrategy hedge funds and distressed opportunistic and other absolute return strategies blackrock invests alongside clients in many of these products as a way of evidencing our longterm commitment to these strategies and alignment of interest with our clients these coinvestments are held on balance sheet and marked to market while alternative investment strategies generally are designed to provide returns with low correlations to the broad equity and bond markets market turmoil affected all strategies in 2008 and return correlations increased dramatically 

in many ways 2008 was a “perfect storm” for alternative investments – frozen capital markets lack of financing forced deleveraging poor absolute returns imposition of redemption constraints and revelation of a massive alleged hedgefund fraud in which none of blackrock’s fund of funds were invested industrywide investors sought to redeem hedge fund and fund of fund holdings in record numbers and were often forced to liquidate better performing products that could provide liquidity blackrock was able to meet all redemption requests in these products in 2008 despite these headwinds blackrock raised 29 billion of net new business across a range of alternative products during the year which helped to offset market and foreign exchange declines of 143 billion at yearend alternative investment aum totaled 597 billion

assets managed for taxexempt institutions including defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans foundations endowments and other nonprofit organizations decreased 11 to 2712 billion at december 31 2008 due to adverse markets and foreign exchange translation in 2008 blackrock was awarded net new business of 196 billion from taxexempt clients including 33 billion of advisory assets driven by significant inflows from us and international pension funds during the year blackrock continued to gain traction with defined contribution pension plans particularly in the us and the uk in recognition of the company’s strong equity offerings and newer target date and target risk products in addition clients increasingly sought strategic relationships and customized investment solutions and our work throughout the year with taxexempt institutions ranged from tailoring portfolios and benchmarks to designing liabilitydriven investments and multiasset class solutions to comprehensive fiduciary outsourcing assignments 

aum for taxable institutions decreased 124 billion or 7 to 1653 billion at yearend 2008 approximately 44 of the decline was due to adverse market and foreign exchange movements the remainder reflected outflows in investment assets of 128 billion 72 of which resulted from the merger of a single large insurance client partially offset by 58 billion of inflows in advisory assets blackrock is one of the largest managers of insurance assets worldwide and continues to benefit from increasing momentum toward investment outsourcing this business is however subject to event risk arising from insurance company mergers as we experienced during the year

retail and high net worth 

blackrock’s investment management expertise is available to retail investors globally through separate accounts openend and closedend funds unit trusts and other collective investment vehicles as of yearend 2008 blackrock managed 2281 billion on behalf of retail and high net worth investors worldwide with 57 in equity and alternative investment products 30 in fixed income and 13 in money market funds the product mix differed considerably by region with international investors holding a much greater proportion of assets in equity funds 90 vs 50 going into 2008 adverse markets and sharply higher investor redemption rates caused international retail aum to fall much more significantly during the year resulting in a meaningful shift in the client mix specifically the company started 2008 with a 6238 mix of aum managed for us and international investors respectively and ended the year with a 7327 mix 

as of december 31 2008 blackrock managed 1668 billion of assets for us retail and high net worth investors notwithstanding the significant challenges faced by retail distributors and investors blackrock was able to enhance its positioning and market share during the year net new business in retail totaled 113 billion a 7 organic growth rate which was partially offset by net outflows of 42 billion in us high net worth products principally brokersold separately managed accounts importantly blackrock secured over 65 new product placements on brokerdealer platforms and had 70 openend and closedend mutual funds with 4 or 5star morningstar ratings as of yearend 2008 

blackrock has an extensive international retail platform anchored by our flagship luxembourgbased fund family blackrock global funds blackrock global funds are registered for sale in 37 countries and in 16 languages as of december 31 2008 blackrock managed 613 billion on behalf of international retail investors as referenced above aum were down significantly due to adverse equity markets and accelerating redemption rates yearoveryear international retail aum dropped 45 or 556 billion due to market declines and foreign exchange translation alone 

net inflows from international retail clients of 08 billion in the first half of the year were offset by 89 billion of outflows in the second half of the year outflows were particularly concentrated in korea where a change in taxation caused a large scale reallocation away from offshore products and in taiwan where many retail investors redeemed products that included capital guarantees or other structuring elements because of concern about the future of investment banks the mass migration of retail investors away from mutual funds in spain and italy was another detrimental factor 

despite 2008’s hostile markets the robustness of the blackrock brand and international retail platform ensured that the company remained the second largest crossborder mutual fund provider internationally and one of the top net sellers in that market in the uk blackrock was the top net seller in 2008 the company benefitted from retail investor demand for balanced absolute return and cash products during the period with its flagship global allocation product dominating industry sales for most of the year 

competition 

blackrock competes with investment management firms mutual fund complexes insurance companies banks brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to or alternatives to those offered by blackrock in order to grow its business blackrock must be able to compete effectively for aum key competitive factors include investment performance track records investment style and discipline client service and brand name recognition historically the company has competed principally on the basis of its longterm investment performance track record its investment process its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service blackrock has historically grown aggregate aum and management believes that the company will continue to do so by focusing on strong investment performance and client service and by developing new products and new distribution capabilities certain of the company’s competitors however have greater marketing resources than blackrock particularly in retail channels and outside the united states these factors may place blackrock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing aum and to attract new business will be successful

continued capital losses on investments could have adverse income tax consequences 

the company may generate realized and unrealized capital losses on seed investments and coinvestments realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes the company has unrealized capital losses for which a deferred tax asset has been established in the event such unrealized losses are realized the company may not be able to offset such losses within the carryback or carryforward period or from future realized capital gains in which case the deferred tax asset will not be utilized the failure to utilize the deferred tax asset could materially increase blackrock’s income tax expense 

the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect blackrock 

financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships blackrock and the products and accounts that it manages have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose blackrock or the funds and accounts that it manages to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely impact blackrock’s revenues and earnings 

the failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to reduced aum in similar products of blackrock without regard to the performance of blackrock’s products 

the failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products of blackrock without regard to the performance of blackrock’s products such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on our aum revenues and earnings 

loss of key employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

the ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to blackrock’s growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients the market for qualified fund managers investment analysts financial advisers and other professionals is competitive there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

separate account clients may terminate their investment management contracts with blackrock or withdraw funds on short notice the company has from time to time lost separate accounts and could in the future lose accounts or significant aum under various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance 

additionally blackrock manages its us mutual funds pursuant to management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds’ boards of directors annually a majority of the directors of each mutual fund are independent from blackrock consequently there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund managed by the company will approve the fund’s management contract each year or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the company 

further the governing agreements of many of the company’s private investment funds generally provide that subject to certain conditions investors in those funds and in some cases independent directors of those funds may remove the investment adviser general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote resulting in a reduction in the management or performance fees as well as the total carried interest blackrock could earn 

  

   

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against blackrock and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

when clients retain blackrock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf they specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the company is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to blackrock’s reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their aum or terminating their contracts any of which could cause the company’s revenues and earnings to decline 

competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins 

the investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry to the extent that the company is forced to compete on the basis of price it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline 

performance fees may increase earnings volatility which could decrease blackrock’s stock price 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments in most cases performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing earnings to be more volatile the volatility in earnings may decrease blackrock’s stock price performance fees represented 177 million or 3 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 

additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position 

blackrock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins these strategies have included smallersized liftouts of investment teams and acquisitions of investment management businesses such as the mlim and quellos transactions in general these strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position in the investment management industry in the event blackrock pursues additional sizeable acquisitions it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from these acquisitions 

risks related to blackrock’s operations 

failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede blackrock’s productivity and growth 

the company’s infrastructure including its technological capacity data centers backup facilities and office space is vital to the competitiveness of its business the failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business including any expansion could impede the company’s productivity and growth which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

  

   

operating in international markets increases blackrock’s operational regulatory and other risks 

as a result of blackrock’s extensive international business activities the company faces increased operational regulatory reputational and foreign exchange rate risks the failure of the company’s systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

failure to maintain a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

a key element to blackrock’s continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage both in terms of operational efficiency and in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into blackrock’s operating systems that support investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients moreover the company’s technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data the failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes 

failure to implement effective information security policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in blackrock’s earnings or stock price 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information security policies procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a hacker attack or a virus or worm or an internally caused issue such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause a decline in the company’s earnings or stock price 

the continuing integration of the quellos business creates numerous risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect profitability 

the quellos business and personnel are in the process of being integrated with blackrock’s previously existing business and personnel these transition activities are complex and the company may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result the company may not be able to realize the expected revenue growth and other benefits that it hopes to achieve from the transaction in addition blackrock may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on the development and expansion of its business and services 

  

   

risks related to relationships with bank of america merrill lynch and pnc 

merrill lynch is an important distributor of blackrock’s products and the company is therefore subject to risks associated with the business of merrill lynch 

under a global distribution agreement entered into with merrill lynch merrill lynch provides distribution portfolio administration and servicing for certain blackrock asset management products and services through its various distribution channels the company may not be successful in distributing products through merrill lynch or in distributing its products and services through other third party distributors if blackrock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distributionrelated costs blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

loss of market share with merrill lynch’s global private client group could harm operating results 

a significant portion of blackrock’s revenue has historically come from aum generated by merrill lynch’s global private client group “gpc” blackrock’s ability to maintain a strong relationship with gpc or any successor group at bank of america is material to the company’s future performance if one of the company’s competitors gains significant additional market share within the gpc retail channel at the expense of blackrock then blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted 

for so long as bank of americamerrill lynch and pnc maintain certain levels of stock ownership bank of americamerrill lynch and pnc will vote as stockholders in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of bank of americamerrill lynch and pnc 

as a result of stockholder agreements entered into with pnc and merrill lynch together with the company’s ownership structure stockholders may have no effective power to influence corporate actions at february 27 2009 merrill lynch owned approximately 49 of blackrock’s voting common stock and approximately 474 of its total capital stock on a fullydiluted basis and pnc owned approximately 465 of blackrock’s outstanding voting common stock and approximately 315 of its total capital stock on a fullydiluted basis 

merrill lynch and pnc have agreed to vote all of their shares in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors to the extent consistent with the provisions of the merrill lynch stockholder agreement and the pnc implementation and stockholder agreement as a consequence matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval including elections of directors will be approved or disapproved solely in accordance with the determinations of the blackrock board of directors so long as the shares held by merrill lynch and pnc constitute a majority of the outstanding shares this arrangement has the effect of concentrating control over blackrock in its board of directors whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the board

blackrock reports its financial results on a gaap basis however management believes that evaluating the company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional nongaap basis financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators for both management and investors of blackrock’s financial performance over time blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 

certain prior period nongaap data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation computations for all periods are derived from the company’s consolidated statements of income as follows 

a operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted 

operating income as adjusted equals operating income gaap basis excluding certain items deemed nonrecurring by management or transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock’s book value as indicated in the table below operating income used for operating margin measurement equals operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and commissions operating margin as adjusted equals operating income used for operating margin measurement divided by revenue used for operating margin measurement as indicated in the table below

management believes that operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted are effective indicators of blackrock’s performance over time as such management believes that operating income as adjusted and operating margin as adjusted provide useful disclosure to investors 

operating income as adjusted 

restructuring charges recorded in 2008 consist of compensation costs and professional fees mlim and quellos integration costs recorded in 2007 consist principally of certain professional fees rebranding costs and compensation costs incurred in conjunction with these integrations the expenses associated with i the 2008 restructuring ii mlim and quellos integration costs and iii the 2007 termination of the closedend fund administration and servicing arrangements with merrill lynch have been deemed nonrecurring by management and have been excluded from operating income as adjusted to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior periods as such management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating blackrock’s operating performance for the respective periods 

the portion of compensation expense associated with certain longterm incentive plans “ltip” that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of blackrock stock held by pnc and the anticipated merrill lynch compensation contribution have been excluded because exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of ltip participants’ put options primarily in the three months ended march 31 2007 these charges do not impact blackrock’s book value 

compensation expense associated with appreciation depreciation on assets related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans which substantially offset this expense are reported in nonoperating income 

operating margin as adjusted 

operating income used for measuring operating margin as adjusted is equal to operating income as adjusted excluding the impact of closedend fund launch costs and commissions management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the company’s results until future periods 

revenue used for operating margin as adjusted excludes portfolio administration and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties management believes that excluding such costs is useful because the company receives offsetting revenue for these services amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement as adjusted because such costs over time offset distribution fee revenue earned by the company reimbursable property management compensation represents compensation and benefits paid to personnel of metric property management inc “metric” a subsidiary of blackrock realty advisors inc “realty” these employees were retained on metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by realty’s clients the related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin as adjusted because they bear no economic cost to blackrock

    business outlook 

as fiscal 2009 began domestic and international markets continued to reflect a difficult market environment due to a downturn in the global economy illiquid capital markets lack of financing and forced deleveraging have resulted in extreme price declines across many asset classes the us housing market and credit markets continue to be ongoing concerns and revelations of a massive alleged hedge fund fraud in which none of blackrock’s funds of funds were invested have contributed to investors industrywide seeking to redeem hedge fund and fund of funds holdings in record numbers 

the timing and direction of volatile markets investment performance and new client asset flows will continue to impact the revenue the company recognizes the direction of markets particularly real estate and private equity will also affect the valuation of the assets on the company’s balance sheet

investments 

consolidation of investments 

the accounting method used for the company’s investments generally is dependent upon the influence the company has over its investee for investments where blackrock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which generally exists if there is a 50 or greater voting interest or if partners or members of certain products do not have substantive rights the investee is consolidated into blackrock’s financial statements pursuant to fin 46r for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests “variable interest entities” or “vies” an investee may be consolidated if blackrock is considered the primary beneficiary of the vie the primary beneficiary of a vie is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of holding variable interests 

significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie if the company and its related parties is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a vie the entity will be consolidated within blackrock’s consolidated financial statements in order to determine whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios assumptions made in such analyses include but are not limited to market prices of securities market interest rates potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities gain realization liquidity or marketability of certain securities discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes

consolidation of investments continued 

  

at december 31 2008 the company applied an expected loss model to certain vies and determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two enhanced cash funds and one private equity fund of funds resulting in the consolidation of the funds on its consolidated statement of financial condition 

the company as general partner or managing member of its funds is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies pursuant to emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 045 determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights  the company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other nonaffiliated partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the investment vehicle or otherwise to remove blackrock as the general partner or managing member without cause based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote or have substantive participating rights if the investment vehicle is not a vie and the presumption of control is not overcome the investment vehicle will be consolidated into blackrock’s financial statements 

blackrock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds in december 2008 blackrock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the unaffiliated investors in three funds with net assets at december 31 2008 of approximately 210 million the granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2008 

at december 31 2008 and 2007 as a result of consolidation of various investment products the company had the following balances on its consolidated statements of financial condition 

 

 the company has retained the specialized accounting of these investment funds pursuant to eitf no 8512 retention of specialized accounting for investments in consolidation

equity method investments 

for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where the company is not the primary beneficiary of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company uses the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity 

substantially all of blackrock’s equity method investees are investment companies which record its underlying investments at fair value therefore under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income expense for investments in investment companies or as other revenue for operating or advisory company investments which are recorded in other assets since such operating or advisory companies are considered to be integral to blackrock’s core business 

at december 31 2008 the company had 501 million and 16 million of equity method investees reflected within investments and other assets respectively and at december 31 2007 the company had 517 million and 5 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets respectively 

impairment of investments 

the company’s management periodically assesses its equity method availableforsale and cost investments for impairment if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist investments are evaluated using market values where available or the expected future cash flows of the investment if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the company’s carrying value of the investment an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income 

when the fair value of an availableforsale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value the company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “otherthantemporary” in making this determination the company considers among other factors the length of time the security has been in a loss position the extent to which the security’s market value is less than its cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses if the impairment is considered otherthantemporary a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income 

the company evaluates its cdo investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment the company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each cdo investment if the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows an impairment is considered otherthantemporary the impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value 

  

   

critical accounting policies continued 

  

impairment of investments continued 

  

for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the company recorded otherthantemporary impairments of 8 million 16 million and 2 million respectively related to debt securities and cdo availableforsale investments the otherthantemporary impairments are due to a reduction in estimated cash flows of cdo investments as well as adverse credit conditions for a debt instrument that was purchased from an enhanced cash management fund in which the company determined that it did not have the ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses 

evaluations of securities impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated statements of income 

fair value measurements 

blackrock adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 157 fair value measurements “ sfas no 157” as of january 1 2008 which requires among other things enhanced disclosures about investments that are measured and reported at fair value sfas no 157 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy ie level 1 2 and 3 inputs as defined the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs additionally companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the level 3 category which have inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable and require significant management judgment including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities 

financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories 

level 1 inputs – quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date level 1 assets include listed mutual funds equities and certain debt securities 

level 2 inputs – quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as models or other valuation methodologies assets which generally are included in this category may include shortterm floating rate notes and assetbacked securities held by a consolidated sponsored cash management fund securities held within consolidated hedge funds certain limited partnership interests in hedge funds in which the valuations for substantially all of the investments within the fund are based upon level 1 or level 2 inputs as well as restricted public securities valued at a discount 

level 3 inputs – unobservable inputs for the valuation of the asset or liability level 3 assets include investments for which there is little if any market activity these inputs require significant management judgment or estimation assets included in this category generally include general and limited partnership interests in private equity funds funds of private equity funds real estate funds hedge funds and funds of hedge funds 

the company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument

fair value measurements continued 

  

blackrock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value for certain investments including investments classified as trading investments equity method investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change for other investments classified as availableforsale securities changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and generally do not directly impact blackrock’s net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired see below marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data nonmarketable securities however generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment valuation services from third party providers internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other market data and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the company’s management based on a number of factors including the liquidity financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment 

changes in fair value on approximately 13 billion of investments will impact the company’s nonoperating income expense and approximately 100 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income as of december 31 2008 changes in fair value of approximately 728 million of such investments within consolidated sponsored investment funds will also impact blackrock’s noncontrolling interests expense on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds is 310 million 

blackrock’s 813 million of level 3 investments at december 31 2008 primarily include coinvestments in real estate equity products private equity fund of funds and private equity funds funds of hedge funds as well as funds that invest in distressed credit and mortgage securities many of these investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund which could include blackrock employees fair value policies at the underlying fund generally utilize pricing information from third party sources however in some instances current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any third party source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third party sources are not reliable in these instances fund management may perform modelbased analytical valuations that may be used to value these investments 

during the year ended december 31 2008 the company reclassified approximately 29 million of net investments out of level 3 the majority of the net reclassification was related to equity method investments which the company uses that certain significant inputs including performance attributes for the fair value measurement of these investments that became observable in addition during the year ended december 31 2008 the company deconsolidated three private equity funds that held at time of deconsolidation approximately 200 million of level 3 investments 

blackrock reports its investments on a gaap basis which includes investment balances which are owned by sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by blackrock in accordance with gaap and therefore are consolidated even though blackrock may not own a majority of such funds as a result management reviews its investments on an “economic” basis which eliminates the portion of investments that do not impact blackrock’s book value blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap

the following table represents investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31 2008 

 

    goodwill and intangible assets 

at december 31 2008 the carrying amounts of the company’s goodwill and intangible assets were as follows 

 

 the value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary openend funds and closedend funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinitelived intangible asset the assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives which at december 31 2008 ranged from 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 77 years

goodwill and intangible assets continued 

  

goodwill 

the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company at july 31 2008 the impairment test that was performed indicated no impairment charges were required the company continues to monitor its book value per share as compared to closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment at december 31 2008 the company’s common stock closed at 13415 which exceeded its book value of approximately 93 per share 

intangibles 

the company assesses its indefinitelived management contracts for impairment at least annually considering such factors as aum product mix product margins and projected cash flows to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinitelife classification is still appropriate the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows the fair value of finitelived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment in addition if such circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform an impairment test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis if the asset is determined to be impaired the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined 

expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment including market interest rates equity prices credit default ratings discount rates revenue multiples inflation rates and aum growth rates actual results could differ from these estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion in both july and september 2008 as well as during 2007 and 2006 the company performed impairment tests which indicated no impairment charges were required the company continues to monitor various factors including aum for potential indicators of impairment 

in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 146 million 130 million and 38 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes “sfas no 109” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

blackrock adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january 1 2007 fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 fin no 48 prescribes a threshold for measurement and recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return fin no 48 also provides guidance on among other things derecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 

the application of sfas no 109 and fin no 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes which require significant management judgment actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2008 blackrock had 114 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 60 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

in accordance with sfas no 109 management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assess deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2008 the company had net deferred tax assets of 11 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately 1825 million on the statement of financial condition changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company sfas 109 requires the company to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a more likely than not standard this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of recent losses forecast of future profitability the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods the company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

as of december 31 2008 the company has recorded a deferred tax asset of 157 million for unrealized investment losses however no valuation allowance has been established because the company expects to be able to carry back a portion of its unrealized capital losses when realized hold certain fixed income securities over a period sufficient for them to recover their unrealized losses and generate future capital gains sufficient to offset the unrealized capital losses based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized however changes in circumstance could cause the company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change such changes may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k for further details 

further the company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivable of approximately 44 million and current income taxes payable of 120 million at december 31 2008

revenue recognition 

investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or in the case of certain real estate separate accounts net operating income generated by the underlying properties and are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions 

the company contracts with third parties as well as related parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain non us funds managed by the company such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the company’s management fee paid by the fund in certain cases the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that blackrock bears no credit risk to the third party the company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with eitf no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and records its investment advisory and administration base fees net of retrocessions retrocessions for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were 762 million 780 million and 156 million respectively the company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties which due to the terms of the contracts are recorded as portfolio administration and servicing costs on the consolidated statements of income 

the company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts these performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period which vary by product for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 performance fee revenue totaled 177 million 350 million and 242 million respectively 

the company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds blackrock may be required to return all or part of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2008 and 2007 the company had 21 million and 29 million respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition 

fees earned for blackrock solutions  which include advisory services are recorded as services are performed and are determined using some or all of the following methods i fixed fees ii percentages of various attributes of advisory assets under management and iii performance fees if contractual thresholds are met revenue earned in 2008 on advisory assignments was comprised of onetime advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on aum of the respective portfolio assignment for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 blackrock solutions and advisory revenue totaled 406 million 198 million and 148 million respectively 

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of aum and since the company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback of carried interest is mathematically improbable

eps impact related to retrospective application of recent accounting developments 

pursuant to fsp apb 141 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement “fsp apb 141” the company will allocate a component of the initial proceeds of its convertible debentures to create a debt discount which will be amortized over the expected life of the convertible debentures

aum market price risk 

blackrock’s investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on aum at december 31 2008 the majority of our investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end aum of the applicable mutual funds or separate accounts movements in equity market prices interest ratescredit spreads foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of aum to decline which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees 

corporate investments portfolio risks 

in the normal course of its business blackrock is exposed to equity market price risk interest ratecredit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments 

blackrock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes including real estate private equity and hedge funds investments generally are made to establish a performance track record for coinvestment purposes or to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans currently the company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into total return swaps to hedge exposure to certain equity investments at december 31 2008 the outstanding total return swaps had an aggregate notional value of approximately 49 million 

at december 31 2008 approximately 728 million of blackrock’s total investments were maintained in sponsored investment funds that are deemed to be controlled by blackrock in accordance with gaap and therefore are consolidated even though blackrock may not own a majority of such funds including the impact of the seed capital hedging program the company’s net economic exposure to its investment portfolio is as follows 

 

 the net “economic” investment exposure of the portfolio is presented in either the market price or the interest ratecredit spread risk disclosures below 

market price risk 

at december 31 2008 the company’s net exposure to price risk in its investment portfolio is approximately 655 million of the company’s net economic investment exposure investments that are subject to market price risk include private equity and real estate investments the company estimates that a 10 adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately 655 million in the carrying value of such investments 

  

 interest ratecredit spread risk 

at december 31 2008 the company was exposed to interestrate risk and credit spread risks as a result of approximately 307 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments in the aggregate would result in a decrease or increase of approximately 28 million in the carrying value of such investments 

foreign exchange rate risk 

as discussed above the company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes the carrying value of the net economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound sterling and the euro was 46 million a 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a 46 million decline in the carrying value of such investments

risks related to blackrock’s business and competition 

changes in the securities or other markets could lead to a decline in revenues 

blackrock’s investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns earned on aum movements in equity market prices interest rates foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the following which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees 

 

  

  

  

  

 poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

the company’s management believes that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of aum poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks and to competitors could reduce revenues and growth because 

 

  

  

 blackrock may elect to invest in or provide other support to its products from time to time 

blackrock may at its option from time to time support investment products through seed or followon investments warehouse lending facilities or other forms of capital or credit support see for example “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —other operating items” and “—liquidity and capital resources” such investments or support utilize capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes losses on such investments or support or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products could have an adverse impact on revenues and earnings 

changes in the securities or other markets could lead to a decline in the value of investments that blackrock owns 

at december 31 2007 blackrock held approximately 20 billion of investments that are reflected on its statement of financial condition approximately 11 billion of this amount is the result of consolidation of certain sponsored investment funds blackrock’s economic interest in these investments is the result of seed investments in its sponsored investment funds a decline in the prices of stocks or bonds or value of real estate or other alternative investments within or outside the united states could lower the value of these investments and result in a decline of nonoperating income 

  

   

loss of key employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

the ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to blackrock’s growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients the market for qualified fund managers investment analysts financial advisers and other professionals is competitive key employees may depart because of issues relating to the difficulties in integrating the mlim or quellos businesses there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 

blackrock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors 

separate account clients may terminate their investment management contracts with blackrock or withdraw funds on short notice the company has from time to time lost separate accounts and could in the future lose accounts or significant assets under management under various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance 

additionally blackrock manages its us mutual funds pursuant to management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds’ boards of directors annually a majority of the directors of each mutual fund are independent from blackrock consequently there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund that the company manages will approve the fund’s management contract each year or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the company 

further the governing agreements of many of the company’s private investment funds generally provide that subject to certain conditions investors in those funds and in some cases independent directors of those funds may remove the investment adviser general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote resulting in a reduction in the management or incentive fees as well as the total carried interest we would earn 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against blackrock and loss of revenues due to client terminations 

when clients retain blackrock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf they specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the company is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to blackrock’s reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses withdrawing their aum or terminating their contracts any of which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins 

the investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry to the extent that the company is forced to compete on the basis of price it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline 

performance fees may increase earnings volatility which could decrease blackrock’s stock price 

a portion of the company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments in most cases performance fees are based on investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition causing earnings to be more volatile than if assets were not managed on a performance fee basis the volatility in earnings may decrease blackrock’s stock price performance fees represented 3502 million or 72 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 

  

   

additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position 

blackrock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins these strategies have included smallersized liftouts of investment teams and acquisitions of investment management businesses such as the mlim and quellos transactions in general these strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position in the investment management industry in the event blackrock pursues additional sizeable acquisitions it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from these acquisitions 

risks related to blackrock’s operations 

failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede the ability to support business growth 

blackrock has experienced significant growth in its business activities as a result of the mlim and quellos transactions and other efforts the company is in the process of building out its infrastructure to integrate the mlim and quellos businesses and to support continued growth including technological capacity data centers backup facilities and sufficient space for expanding staff levels the failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with expansion could impede the company’s growth which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

expansion into international markets increases blackrock’s operational regulatory and other risks 

blackrock has increased its international business activities as a result of the mlim transaction and other efforts as a result of such expansion the company faces increased operational regulatory reputation and foreign exchange rate risks the failure of the company’s systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks or of its operating infrastructure to support such international expansion could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

failure to maintain a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

a key element to blackrock’s continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage both in terms of operational efficiency and in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into blackrock’s operating systems that support investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients moreover the company’s technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data the failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes 

  

   

failure to implement effective information security policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in blackrock’s earnings or stock price 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information security policies procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a hacker attack or a virus or worm or an internally caused issue such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause a decline in the company’s earnings or stock price 

the continuing integration of the mlim and quellos businesses creates numerous risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect profitability 

the mlim and quellos businesses and personnel are in the process of being integrated with blackrock’s previously existing business and personnel these transition activities are complex and the company may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result the company may not be able to realize the expected revenue growth and other benefits that it hopes to achieve from the respective transactions in addition blackrock may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on the development and expansion of its business and services 

risks related to relationships with merrill lynch and pnc 

merrill lynch is an important distributor of blackrock’s products and the company is therefore subject to risks associated with the business of merrill lynch 

under a global distribution agreement entered into with merrill lynch in connection with the mlim transaction merrill lynch provides distribution portfolio administration and servicing for certain blackrock asset management products and services through its various distribution channels the company may not be successful in distributing products through merrill lynch or in distributing its products and services through other third party distributors if blackrock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distributionrelated costs blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

loss of market share with merrill lynch’s global private client group could harm operating results 

a significant portion of the revenue of the mlim business has historically come from aum generated by merrill lynch’s global private client group “gpc” blackrock’s ability to maintain a strong relationship with gpc is material to the company’s future performance if one of the company’s competitors gains significant additional market share within the gpc retail channel at the expense of blackrock then blackrock’s business results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted 

  

   

for so long as merrill lynch and pnc maintain certain levels of stock ownership merrill lynch and pnc will vote as stockholders in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of merrill lynch and pnc 

as a result of the stockholder agreements entered into with pnc and merrill lynch in connection with the mlim transaction together with the company’s ownership structure stockholders may have no effective power to influence corporate actions as of december 31 2007 merrill lynch owned approximately 451 of blackrock’s issued and outstanding common stock and approximately 490 of total capital stock on a fullydiluted basis and pnc owned approximately 335 of blackrock’s total capital stock 

merrill lynch and pnc have agreed to vote all of their shares in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock’s board of directors to the extent consistent with the provisions of the merrill lynch stockholder agreement and the pnc implementation and stockholder agreement as a consequence matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval including elections of directors will be approved or disapproved solely in accordance with the determinations of the blackrock board of directors so long as the shares held by merrill lynch and pnc constitute a majority of the outstanding shares this arrangement has the effect of concentrating control over blackrock in its board of directors whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the board 

legal and regulatory risks 

blackrock is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and internationally

failure to comply with the advisers act and the investment company act and related regulations could result in substantial harm to blackrock’s reputation and results of operations 

certain blackrock subsidiaries are registered with the sec under the advisers act and blackrock’s us mutual funds are registered with the sec under the investment company act the advisers act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers including recordkeeping operating and marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes similar obligations as well as additional detailed operational requirements on investment advisers to registered investment companies the failure of any of blackrock’s subsidiaries to comply with the advisers act or the investment company act could cause the sec to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts including censure termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to secregistered funds and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the company’s reputation any of which could cause its earnings or stock price to decline 

  

   

failure to comply with erisa regulations could result in penalties and cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline

blackrock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities 

since pnc’s ownership interest in blackrock exceeds 25 blackrock is deemed to be a nonbank subsidiary of pnc a financial holding company which subjects blackrock to general banking regulations that limit the activities and the types of businesses in which it may engage banking regulations may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc blackrock is subject to the supervision regulation and examination of the frb the company is also subject to the broad enforcement authority of the frb including the frb’s power to prohibit blackrock from engaging in any activity that in the frb’s opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the company’s business the frb also may impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking regulations

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding our consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this form 10k 

investments 

consolidation of investments 

the accounting method used for the company’s investments generally is dependent upon the influence the company has on its investee for investments where blackrock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which generally exists if blackrock has a 50 or greater voting interest the investee is consolidated into blackrock’s financial statements for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests “variable interest entities” or “vies” an investee may be consolidated if blackrock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee 

significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie if the company with its related parties is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a vie the entity will be consolidated within blackrock’s consolidated financial statements in order to determine whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios assumptions made in such analyses include but are not limited to market prices of securities market interest rates potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities gain realization liquidity or marketability of certain securities discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes 

the company as general partner or managing member of its funds is generally presumed to control funds that are limited partnerships or limited liability companies the company reviews such investment vehicles to determine if such a presumption can be overcome by determining if other nonrelated party partners or members of the limited partnership or limited liability company have the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the investment vehicle or otherwise to remove blackrock as the general partner or managing member without cause or have substantive participating rights if the investment vehicle is not a vie and the presumption of control is not overcome the investment vehicle will be consolidated into blackrock’s financial statements 

blackrock acts as general partner or managing member for consolidated private equity funds of funds in december 2007 blackrock took necessary steps to grant additional rights to the third party investors in approximately 14 funds with net assets at december 31 2007 of approximately 1 billion the granting of these rights resulted in the deconsolidation of such investment funds from the consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2007 

  

   

critical accounting policies continued 

  

fair value of investments 

blackrock records substantially all investments on its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value for certain investments including investments classified as trading investments and consolidated sponsored investment funds changes in fair value affect net income in the period of the change for other investments classified as availableforsale securities changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and generally do not directly impact blackrock’s net income until such investments are sold or are considered impaired see below marketable securities are priced using publicly available market data nonmarketable securities however generally are priced using a variety of methods and resources including the most currently available net asset values or capital accounts of the investment internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions or in the absence of other methods and resources the fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the company’s management based on a number of factors including the liquidity financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment 

at december 31 2007 blackrock had approximately 20 billion in investments changes in fair value on approximately 1736 billion of such investments will impact the company’s consolidated statements of income and approximately 264 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income as of december 31 2007 approximately 1054 billion of such investments related to investments within consolidated funds whereby changes in fair value of such investments will impact blackrock’s investment income and noncontrolling interest expense on the consolidated statements of income blackrock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated investment funds is 325 million 

equity method investments 

for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee and where the company is not the primary beneficiary of a vie but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company uses the equity method of accounting the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the legal structure of the investee the terms and structure of the investment agreement including investor voting or other rights the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund’s operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity 

under the equity method of accounting blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income based upon the most currently available information is recorded as nonoperating income  

at december 31 2007 and 2006 the company had 5540 million and 3265 million respectively of equity method investees reflected within investments 

  

   

critical accounting policies continued 

  

impairment of investments 

the company’s management periodically assesses impairment on its investments if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist investments are evaluated using market values where available or the expected future cash flows of the investment if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the company’s carrying value of the investment an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income 

when the fair value of an availableforsale security is lower than its cost or amortized cost value the company evaluates the security to determine whether the impairment is considered “otherthantemporary” in making this determination the company considers among other factors the length of time the security has been in a loss position the extent to which the security’s market value is less than its cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery if the impairment is considered otherthantemporary a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income there were no impairments of investments other than cdos see below for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 or 2005 

the company evaluates its cdo investments for impairment quarterly throughout the term of the investment the company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each cdo investment if the net present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and also is lower than the net present value of the previous estimate of cash flows an impairment is considered otherthantemporary the impairment loss is then recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value cdo impairments were 164 million 23 million and 08 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated statements of income 

goodwill and intangible assets 

at december 31 2007 the carrying amounts of the company’s goodwill and intangible assets were as follows 

 

   

   

critical accounting policies continued 

  

goodwill and intangible assets continued 

  

the value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary openend funds and closedend funds without a specified termination date is classified as an indefinitelived intangible asset the assignment of indefinite lives to such mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives which at december 31 2007 ranged from less than 1 year to 20 years with a weighted average remaining estimated useful life of 87 years 

the company assesses its indefinitelived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually considering factors such as aum product mix projected cash flows average base fees by product and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinitelife classification is still appropriate the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows the fair value of finitelived intangible assets is reviewed at least annually to determine whether circumstances exist which indicate there may be a potential impairment if such circumstances are considered to exist the company will perform an impairment test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis if the asset is determined to be impaired the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined 

expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment including market interest rates equity prices credit default ratings discount rates revenue multiples inflation rates and aum growth rates actual results could differ from these estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion no such impairments were recorded in 2007 2006 or 2005 in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period over which intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets or the reclassification of an indefinitelived intangible asset to a finitelived intangible asset could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 1297 million 375 million and 75 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

blackrock adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january 1 2007 fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 fin no 48 prescribes a threshold and measurement attribute for recognition in the financial statements of an asset or liability resulting from a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return fin no 48 also provides guidance on among other things derecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 

  

   

critical accounting policies continued 

  

income taxes continued 

  

the application of sfas no 109 and fin no 48 requires management to make estimates of the ranges of possible outcomes the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes which require significant management judgment actual future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company’s current estimates at december 31 2007 blackrock had 663 million of unrecognized tax benefits of which 406 million if recognized would affect the effective tax rate 

in accordance with sfas no 109 management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets and assesses deferred tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances including statutory income tax rate changes statutory tax law changes changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company such changes in circumstance would cause the company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the income statement in the period of the change such changes may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements at december 31 2007 the company had deferred tax assets of 91 million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately 21 billion 

further the company records its income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit the company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit the company had current income taxes receivable of approximately 471 million and current income taxes payable of 2284 million at december 31 2007 

revenue recognition 

investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or in the case of certain real estate separate accounts net operating income generated by the underlying properties and are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations or voluntary waivers certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are generally recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions 

the company contracts with third parties as well as related parties for various mutual fund administration and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds managed by the company such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the company’s management fee paid by the fund in certain cases the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that blackrock bears no credit risk to the third party the company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and records its investment advisory and administration fees net of retrocessions retrocessions for the year ended december 31 2007 and 2006 were 7804 million and 1560 million respectively 

the company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts these performance fees generally are earned upon exceeding specified investment return thresholds such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 performance fee revenue totaled 3502 million 2423 million and 1680 million respectively 

  

   

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

  

revenue recognition continued 

  

the company receives carried interest from certain alternative investment funds upon exceeding performance thresholds blackrock may be required to return all or part of such carried interest depending upon future performance of these investments blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions as revenue on its consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the alternative investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria at december 31 2007 and 2006 the company had 286 million and 0 respectively of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition 

adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated on the fair value of aum and since the company does not record revenues until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback of carried interest is mathematically improbable management can give no assurance however that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future

 overview continued 

blackrock’s business results largely reflect its position as a leading provider of fixed income asset management services to institutional clients of the 3039 billion of fixed income assets managed at december 31 2005 approximately 2802 billion or 922 were from institutional clients with the remaining 237 billion managed in the company’s openend and closedend fixed income investment companies the company is also among the largest managers of institutional money market funds and other cash management services blackrock has made significant investments to expand its product offerings to include equity and alternative investment products and to enhance its ability to serve the needs of individual investors in addition the company continues to invest in blackrock solutions  which achieved revenue growth of 385 in 2005 

in january 2005 the company closed its acquisition of ssrm holdings inc and its subsidiaries collectively “ssr” from metlife inc “metlife” for adjusted consideration of approximately 3023 million consisting of 2651 million in cash and 550000 restricted shares of class a common stock not including certain additional contingent payments see further discussion in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the company initially financed 1500 million of the purchase price with a bridge promissory note at an annual rate of 2875 in february 2005 the company issued 2500 million of convertible debentures see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the debentures bear interest at a rate of 2625 per annum and are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 97282 shares per 1000 principal amount the company used a portion of the net proceeds from this issuance to retire the bridge promissory note the acquisition added 497 billion in aum 

while the company operates in a global marketplace characterized by market volatility and economic uncertainty management believes the following factors among others position blackrock to produce solid relative returns for stockholders over time 

 

  

  

  

  

 the company’s ability to increase its revenue earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate net new business in investment management and blackrock solutions products and services new business efforts are dependent on blackrock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and to deliver excellent client service all of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of blackrock employees accordingly the ability to retain and attract talented professionals to blackrock is critical to its longterm success

 overview continued 

selected financial results for the last five years are shown below 

 

 while blackrock reports its financial results using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” management believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if investors are limited to reviewing only gaap financial measures management reviews nongaap financial measures to assess the company’s ongoing operations and for the reasons described below considers them to be effective indicators for both management and investors of blackrock’s profitability and financial performance over time nevertheless blackrock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 

gaap reported operating income includes all compensation related expenses associated with the longterm retention and incentive plan “ltip” gaap reported operating income also includes appreciation or depreciation on assets related to certain of blackrock’s deferred compensation plans operating income as adjusted a nongaap measure excludes the portion of ltip expense that is to be funded by up to four million shares of blackrock common stock to be surrendered by pnc and distributed to ltip participants because these charges exclusive of the potential impact of ltip participants’ put options will not impact blackrock’s book value a detailed discussion of the ltip is included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements appreciation and depreciation on assets related to certain of blackrock’s deferred compensation plans is also excluded from operating income as adjusted because investment returns on these assets are largely offset by corresponding amounts in compensation expense and therefore result in a nominal impact on net income

 overview continued 

in addition to the previously noted compensation costs associated with the ltip gaap reported net income and gaap diluted earnings per share also include certain charges and gains the aftertax impact of which management considers nonrecurring and therefore excludes in assessing ongoing profitability net income and diluted earnings per share as adjusted a nongaap measure excludes the aftertax impact of ltip expense to be funded by pnc professional fees associated with the ssr acquisition gains recognized on the release of reserves related to new york state and new york city tax audits and a net gain recognized on the sale of blackrock’s equity interest in trepp llc 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed reconciliation of gaap reported operating income net income and diluted earnings per share to adjusted nongaap operating income net income and diluted earnings per share 

products 

blackrock offers a wide variety of fixed income cash management equity and alternative investment products revenue from these products primarily consists of advisory fees typically structured as a percentage of assets managed and in some instances performance fees expressed as a percentage of returns realized in excess of agreedupon targets blackrock also offers risk management investment system outsourcing and financial advisory services to institutional investors under the blackrock solutions brand name 

fixed income 

blackrock’s fixed income business continued to expand in 2005 as aum increased by 263 to 3039 billion at december 31 2005 the company offers investors a broad range of products that span global bond markets and sectors as well as various maturities along the yield curve all fixed income portfolios are managed by blackrock’s fixed income team which is comprised of sector specialists who help formulate broad investment strategy and implement sectorspecific themes in accordance with each portfolio’s investment objectives and guidelines these investment professionals are supported by extensive analytical tools and a shared research database that includes reports from both equity and credit analysts throughout the company investment operations are facilitated by blackrock’s proprietary portfolio management system aladdin ®  and by an experienced team of operations administration and compliance professionals 

blackrock’s fixed income portfolio management team has achieved competitive investment performance by consistently employing a disciplined process designed to add incremental returns in excess of benchmarks approximately 95 percent or more of blackrock’s institutional composites outperformed their benchmarks and 70 or more of taxable bond fund assets ranked in the top two lipper quartiles for the one three and five years ended december 31 2005 

net new business totaled 373 billion in 2005 new assignments spanned the company’s product base resulting in greater diversification within fixed income core bond mandates for example have grown at a compound annual rate of 178 over the past five years to 1191 billion at december 31 2005 over the same period targeted duration and global bond assets have grown at an even faster pace albeit from smaller bases as a result the proportion of fixed income assets invested in targeted duration portfolios has increased from 265 to 335 since 2001 and global bond mandates expanded from 08 to 84 of total fixed income assets over the same period 

during the year the company also further diversified its client base geographically as nonus investors sought additional exposure to the us and global bond markets these clients awarded blackrock net new business of 221 billion which represented 591 of total net inflows in fixed income during the year us investors also contributed to asset growth during the year with net inflows of 153 billion

fixed income continued 

in 2005 blackrock achieved greater diversification across client segments as well net inflows from taxexempt investors totaled 94 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 insurance companies and other financial institutions continued to pursue outsourcing options awarding blackrock 285 billion of net new business 

cash management 

blackrock provides cash management services to institutional and individual investors through a variety of money market funds and customized portfolios at yearend 2005 aum in these strategies totaled 861 billion up 103 from yearend 2004 net new business totaled 72 billion during the year although flows varied widely across products 

money market funds represented 807 of total cash management assets at december 31 2005 with customized portfolios and other funds making up the remaining 193 during 2005 net inflows were largely from us clients investing in mutual fund products 

asset flows in these products can be quite volatile particularly in response to prevailing monetary policy typically when the federal reserve raises rates as it did eight times in 2005 and again in early 2006 yields on direct investments reflect the increases immediately if not in anticipation while money market fund yields reflect the increases more slowly institutional investors exploit this shortterm yield differential by shifting assets out of money market funds and into direct investments 

despite this difficult environment blackrock grew cash management assets during 2005 this was due to the strong performance of the company’s products distinctive customer service and a broad product set that includes enhanced yield strategies investors seeking yield enhancement have limited choices such as taking additional credit risk or investing in longerterm securities blackrock works directly with clients to consider these options relative to their objectives and to offer appropriate investment alternatives 

pfpc trust company a subsidiary of pnc offers securities lending agent services to its mutual fund and other custody clients as well as a number of third party lending agent clients blackrock manages the cash collateral generated when these clients lend the securities in their portfolios these services are most often utilized by equity mutual funds accordingly flows in these portfolios are highly sensitive to among other things equity market conditions in 2005 securities lending assets decreased by 16 billion 

equity 

blackrock’s equity aum rose by 225 billion or 1522 to 373 billion in 2005 in january 2005 the company completed its acquisition of ssr the acquisition was motivated in part by the opportunity to expand blackrock’s equity platform which we achieved by transitioning 171 billion of equity aum through year end apart from the ssr assets we continued to benefit from increased recognition of our equity capabilities attracting 35 billion of net new business during the year 

the acquisition enabled the company to expand the resources available to investors in the small and midcap growth value and opportunities products and to add active fundamental largecap growth natural resources and asset allocation strategies the company believes that this expanded platform will better position it to serve the equity needs of both individuals and institutions while the ssr acquisition added meaningfully to our equity platform we did experience outflows of 19 billion in equities due to style andor objective changes these outflows were within the range of our expectations for the transaction 

the company’s equity products which span the risk spectrum employ either an active quantitative approach or an active fundamental approach both of which seek to add value principally through stock selection the former utilizes quantitative models to assess company data and predict expected returns on individual stocks and a portfolio construction process that targets “best ideas” while carefully

controlling risks taken relative to the benchmark the latter uses company research conducted by blackrock’s equity analysts to develop views on individual stocks and a portfolio construction process that targets “best ideas” across all sectors with less emphasis on deviations from the benchmark other than the applicable capitalization range portfolios are managed by teams that benefit from shared information and a common trading systems operations administration and compliance platform 

investment performance was strong in blackrock’s equity businesses in 2005 as 73 or more of institutional composites outperformed their benchmarks and 68 or more of the company’s mutual funds ranked in the top two lipper quartiles for the one and three years ended december 31 2005 the turnaround of our european equity products was particularly gratifying as the team having maintained conviction in their investment style and process through a difficult period once again achieved strong relative and absolute returns and attracted net new client assets management believes that continued strong performance organizational stability and continuity of investment disciplines will foster further growth in equity aum over time 

alternative investment products 

alternative investment products typically seek to achieve attractive absolute returns andor return profiles minimally correlated with the broader markets in 2005 blackrock expanded its alternative investment platform through both the ssr acquisition and new product development these efforts resulted in 106 billion of acquired aum and 40 billion in net new business across a range of capabilities during the year total assets managed in alternative investments increased by 171 billion to 253 billion at december 31 2005 

as of december 31 2005 fixed income sector specialists managed 76 billion of assets in collateralized debt obligation “cdos” including 15 billion raised in three new vehicles offered during 2005 in january 2005 a team of specialists that manages assetbacked cdos joined blackrock through the ssr acquisition expanding the company’s cdo aum and adding a new dimension to blackrock’s structured product offerings which also include cdos backed by high yield bank loans and corporate credit default swaps 

blackrock’s fixed income team also manages a number of alternative investment strategies using the same investment process that supports traditional bond portfolios fixed income alternative aum totaled 55 billion at december 31 2005 net new business during the year was 08 billion with two of the firm’s newer products a creditoriented hedge fund and an absolute return product targeting broad investment opportunities in global bonds attracting strong investor interest 

equity hedge funds and fund of hedge funds aum totaled 23 billion at december 31 2005 including 04 billion in net new business awarded during the year blackrock’s energy team which joined from ssr continued to achieve strong investment performance in its existing alternative products and launched a new all cap energy hedge fund in 2005 performance was also strong in the firm’s fund of hedge funds business since the acquisition of blackrock hpb management in april 2003 blackrock’s fund of hedge funds continues to demonstrate strong performance versus a variety of industry benchmarks and competitors blackrock’s core multimanager products realized returns of 105 in 2005 net of all fees and expenses in addition the team continued to grow during the year and add to its product set launching an asia pacific fund of hedge funds 

in 2005 the company launched blackrock kelso capital corporation a business development company “blackrock kelso” in concert with kelso  company and raised 529 million in equity capital blackrock kelso draws on the extensive investment expertise of both blackrock and senior principals of kelso  company as well as the talents of an experienced group of investment professionals to provide debt and equity capital to private middlemarket companies

blackrock’s private client business works closely with financial intermediaries and advisers to offer its openend mutual fund family blackrock funds  and to develop closedend funds that enable individual investors to capitalize on market opportunities and more recently to offer separately managed accounts for clients who require tailored portfolios expanding the scale and scope of mutual fund activities was one of the key strategies underlying blackrock’s acquisition of ssr in january 2005 the company merged ssr’s openend funds into blackrock funds  creating a broader product lineup and more than doubling distribution and shareholder servicing resources 

following the closing we experienced 09 billion of net outflows in openend funds that had a manager style or objective change at the time of the ssr closing these outflows were within the range of our expectations across all other funds we achieved net inflows of 20 billion specifically we added 22 billion of net assets through the successful offering of four new closedend funds new business results in the rest of our openend fund family were weaker than we had hoped for although sales trends improved throughout the year as we began to benefit from expanded resources and strong performance at yearend private client assets totaled 433 billion up 347 from december 31 2004 while scale remains a key concern given increased costs in mutual fund sponsorship and management we believe that the investments we made last year to expand our private client effort will enhance our ability to achieve organic growth in the future 

competition 

blackrock competes with investment management firms mutual fund complexes insurance companies banks brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to or alternatives to those offered by blackrock in order to grow its business blackrock must be able to compete effectively for aum key competitive factors include investment performance track records investment style and discipline client service and brand name recognition historically the company has competed principally on the basis of its longterm investment performance track record its investment process its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service blackrock has succeeded in growing aggregate aum and management believes that the company will continue to do so by focusing on strong investment performance and client service and by developing new products and new distribution capabilities many of the company’s competitors however have greater financial or marketing resources and better brand name recognition than blackrock these factors may place blackrock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing aum and attract new business will be successful

pnc is a bank holding company and as discussed below is also a “financial holding company” regulated by the frb as a subsidiary of pnc blackrock is subject to most banking laws regulations and orders that are applicable to pnc and therefore to the supervision regulation and examination of the frb as well as the sec the frb has broad enforcement authority over pnc and its subsidiaries including the power to prohibit pnc or any subsidiary from engaging in any activity that in the frb’s opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business and to impose substantial fines and other penalties supervision and regulation of pnc and its subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of pnc’s banking subsidiaries depositors the deposit insurance funds of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or creditors of national banks or their subsidiaries 

because blackrock is a subsidiary of pnc a regulated financial services firm pnc’s relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of the company’s business the frb sec and other domestic and foreign regulators have broad enforcement powers and powers to approve deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices of pnc or its subsidiaries to conduct new activities acquire or divest businesses or assets or reconfigure existing operations in addition pnc and its bank subsidiaries are subject to examination by various regulators which results in examination reports and ratings which are not publicly available that can impact the conduct and growth of blackrock’s businesses these examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations but also capital levels asset quality and risk management ability and performance earnings liabilities and various other factors an examination downgrade by any of the federal bank regulators of pnc or its subsidiaries potentially can result in the imposition of limitations on certain blackrock activities and on its growth 

as a subsidiary of pnc blackrock may not conduct new activities establish a subsidiary or acquire the stock or assets of another company unless the activity subsidiary stock or assets involve a business authorized for a financial holding company under the provisions of the bank holding company act a nonbank subsidiary of a financial holding company may engage in insurance underwriting insurance investment and merchant banking activities as well as other permissible financial activities including investment management with respect to most nonus activities or investments blackrock must provide notice to andor obtain the approval of the frb the frb will approve only those activities that are usual in connection with the transaction of the business of banking or other financial operations outside of the united states investment management firms with which blackrock competes commonly invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which they provide services blackrock may invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory administrative or other services to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations including applicable banking laws blackrock’s current domestic and overseas activities are permissible for a financial holding company 

pursuant to the grammleachbliley act the “glb act” a qualifying bank holding company may become a financial holding company and engage in a broad range of financial activities a bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is “well capitalized” is “well managed” and has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act pnc became a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 

the frb is the “umbrella” supervisor for financial holding companies in addition the financial holding company’s operating entities such as its subsidiary brokerdealers investment managers investment companies banks and other regulated institutions are also subject to the jurisdiction of various state and federal “functional” regulators 

under federal law pnc banks and their subsidiaries generally may not engage in transactions with pnc or its nonbank subsidiaries except on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same as those prevailing for comparable transactions involving nonaffiliated companies or in the absence of comparable transactions that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to unaffiliated companies

the fdic could be appointed as conservator or receiver of pnc bank if the bank were to become insolvent or if other conditions or events were to occur the fdic also would have the authority to repudiate contracts by a pnc subsidiary bank including servicing or other contracts with blackrock at any time within 180 days of its appointment as conservator or receiver and would be obligated to pay blackrock only “actual direct compensatory damages” not including damages for lost profits or opportunity as of the date of conservatorship or receivership as a result of such repudiation the fdic also could disregard without paying damages any contract that tended to diminish or defeat the fdic’s interest in any pnc subsidiary bank asset if the contract were not 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the fdic could obtain a stay of up to 90 days of any judicial action or proceeding involving a pnc subsidiary bank and could require blackrock to exhaust its remedies under fdic claims procedures before pursuing any available judicial remedy 

pnc’s bank subsidiaries are subject to “crossguarantee” provisions under federal law which provide that if one of these banks or thrifts fails or requires fdic assistance the fdic may assess a “commonly controlled” bank or thrift for the estimated losses suffered by the fdic pnc currently has two banking subsidiaries the fdic’s claim is superior to the claims of affiliates such as blackrock and of shareholders of the banks at december 31 2005 both of pnc’s bank subsidiaries exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well capitalized” under statutory and regulatory standards 

blackrock is subject to the usa patriot act of 2001 which contains the international money laundering abatement and antiterrorist financing act of 2001 that act contains antimoney laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain financial institutions the act requires us financial institutions to adopt policies and procedures to combat money laundering and grants the secretary of the treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions’ operations blackrock has established policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the usa patriot act and related regulations

additional legislation changes in rules promulgated by the sec other federal and state regulatory authorities and selfregulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of blackrock the profitability of blackrock also could be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce in addition the sec and other governmental agencies recently have been investigating the mutual fund industry the sec has adopted and proposed various rules and legislation has been passed in congress the effect of which will further regulate the mutual fund industry and impose on blackrock additional compliance obligations and costs for fulfilling such obligations

 risk factors 

as a leading investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks as previously discussed in this report risk management is considered to be of paramount importance to blackrock’s daytoday operations consequently blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying measuring monitoring managing and analyzing market and operating risks including investments in personnel and technology

change in the securities markets could lead to a decline in revenues 

blackrock’s investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and in some cases performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on aum a decline in the prices of stocks or bonds could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by 

 

  

  

  

 poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

management believes that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the growth of aum poor investment performance relative to the portfolio benchmarks and to competitors could impair blackrock’s revenues and growth because 

 

  

  

  

 loss of key employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

the ability of blackrock to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to its growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients the market for qualified fund managers investment analysts financial advisers and other professionals is competitive there can be no assurance that blackrock will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the company has encouraged the continued retention of executives and other key personnel through measures such as providing deferred compensation and competitive annual and longterm compensation arrangements and in the case of the company’s chairman and chief executive officer an employment agreement however there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in retaining all key personnel loss of a significant number of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 

loss of significant separate accounts could decrease revenues 

blackrock had approximately 600 separate account clients on december 31 2005 of which the five largest generated approximately 126 of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 clients may terminate investment management contracts or withdraw funds on short notice a change of control of blackrock or pnc may require reapproval by registered investment companies of their investment management contracts loss of any of these accounts could reduce revenues the company has from time to time lost separate accounts and could in the future lose accounts under various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance

competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins 

the investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry to the extent that blackrock is forced to compete on the basis of price it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline 

performance fees may increase earnings volatility which could decrease blackrock’s stock price 

a portion of blackrock’s revenues are derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments in most cases performance fees are based on investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if these targets are not exceeded performance fees for that period will not be earned and if targets are based on cumulative returns the company may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns causing earnings to be more volatile than if assets were not managed on a performance fee basis the volatility in earnings may decrease blackrock’s stock price performance fees represented 1680 million or 141 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 

blackrock’s transaction with merrill lynch investment managers is subject to various regulatory approvals client consents approval by blackrock shareholders and other customary closing conditions prior to consummation 

on february 15 2006 the company and two of its whollyowned subsidiaries entered into an agreement with merrill lynch  co inc pursuant to which merrill lynch will contribute its investment management business merrill lynch investment managers to the company the combined company would be one of the world’s largest asset management firms with nearly 1 trillion in aum over 4500 employees in 18 countries and a major presence in most key markets including the united states the united kingdom asia australia the middle east and europe merrill lynch would own approximately 49 but in any event not more than 498 of the combined company including a 45 voting interest pnc would maintain approximately 34 ownership share in the combined company and the remainder would be held by employees and public shareholders the transaction which has been approved by the boards of directors of blackrock and merrill lynch is subject to various regulatory approvals client consents approval by blackrock shareholders and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close on or around september 30 2006 if the necessary approvals are not met by the contractual deadline of january 31 2007 the transaction may not be completed which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

blackrock’s corporate or acquisition strategies may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position 

blackrock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins these strategies have included smallersized liftouts of investment teams and acquisitions of investment management businesses such as the merrill lynch investment managers transaction discussed above in general these strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the company’s competitive position in the investment management industry in the event blackrock pursues meaningful acquisitions it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from these acquisitions 

failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede blackrock’s ability to support business growth 

blackrock continues to experience significant growth in its business activities the company must maintain adequate infrastructure to support this growth including technological capacity data centers backup facilities and sufficient space for expanding staff levels the failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the company’s expansion could impede blackrock’s growth which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline

 businessrelated risks continued 

failure to comply with government regulations could result in fines or temporary or permanent prohibitions on business activities which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

the company’s business is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and certain of its activities are subject to the laws of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies or bodies recently the sec and other governmental agencies have been investigating the mutual fund industry the sec has adopted and proposed various rules and legislation has been passed in congress the effect of which will further regulate the mutual fund industry and impose on blackrock additional compliance obligations and costs for fulfilling such obligations violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines temporary or permanent prohibition of the engagement in certain activities reputational harm suspensions of personnel or revocation of their licenses suspension or termination of investment adviser or brokerdealer registrations or other sanctions which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

certain of blackrock’s subsidiaries are registered with the sec under the investment advisers act and the company’s mutual funds are registered with the sec under the investment company act the investment advisers act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers including recordkeeping operating and marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes similar obligations as well as additional detailed operational requirements on investment advisers to registered investment companies the failure of any of the company’s subsidiaries to comply with the investment advisers act or the investment company act could cause the sec to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts including censure termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to secregistered funds and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to blackrock’s reputation any of which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

failure to maintain blackrock’s technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues 

a key element to the company’s continued success is the ability to maintain its technological advantage both in terms of operational efficiency and in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into blackrock’s operating systems that support investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients moreover the company’s technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide blackrock with various types of data the failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact blackrock’s ability to provide services to blackrock solutions clients there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes 

blackrock has become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the global financial and equity markets 

blackrock has become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the domestic and global financial and equity markets due to the continuing threat of terrorism and the recent reports of accounting irregularities at certain public companies declines in these markets have caused in the past and could cause in the future a decline in revenue and net income

 businessrelated risks continued 

blackrock’s expansion into international markets increases its operational and other risks 

as blackrock continues to expand its business activities internationally the company faces increased operational regulatory reputational and foreign exchange rate risk the failure of blackrock’s systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks or of its operating infrastructure to support such international expansion could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

failure to implement effective information security policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in the company’s earnings or stock price 

blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information security policies procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a hacker attack or a virus or worm or an internally caused issue such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause a decline in the company’s earnings or stock price 

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations both of which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

when clients retain blackrock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf they specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the company is required to observe in the provision of its services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to blackrock’s reputation or to the client seeking to recover losses reducing its assets under investment or risk management or terminating its contract any of which could cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

failure to comply with erisa regulations could result in penalties and cause the company’s earnings or stock price to decline 

blackrock’s asset management subsidiaries are subject to erisa and to regulations promulgated thereunder insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under erisa with respect to benefit plan clients erisa and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa prohibit specified transactions involving erisa plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions the failure of any of the company’s subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce earnings or cause the company’s stock price to decline 

concentration of pncrelated assets in total assets under management could result in loss of revenue if the pncrelated assets are withdrawn by pnc or pncrelated accounts 

approximately 62 283 billion of total aum at december 31 2005 represents assets related to pnc pnc or pncrelated accounts generated 639 million or 54 of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 pnc or pncrelated accounts may withdraw these assets at any time and the company may not be able to replace them in addition blackrock may not be successful in increasing sales through pnc channels and pnc may decide not to continue using or making available the company’s products

 pncrelated risks 

the company’s largest stockholder pnc controls a majority of the outstanding voting power of common stock and other stockholders will be unable to affect the outcome of stockholder voting while pnc remains the majority stockholder 

four of the company’s 13 directors are directors andor executive officers of pnc and as of december 31 2005 pnc indirectly owned approximately 70 of blackrock’s outstanding common stock representing approximately 85 of the combined voting power of all classes of voting stock as long as pnc owns a majority of the voting power of blackrock’s common stock pnc will be able to elect the entire board of directors and to remove any director with or without cause and generally to determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval additionally the company’s amended and restated bylaws provide that subject to applicable law and rules of the new york stock exchange “nyse” prior to the date on which pnc or another person beneficially owns less than a majority of the voting power of common stock a majority of all directors on the committees of the board of directors will be designated by pnc or such other person as a result subject to the power of executive management to manage daytoday operations pnc will be in a position to continue to control all matters affecting the company including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 banking regulation of pnc and blackrock limits business activities and the types of businesses in which the company may engage 

effective january 18 2005 pnc’s ownership in blackrock was transferred to pnc bancorp inc the transfer was effected primarily to give blackrock more operating flexibility particularly in anticipation of its acquisition of ssr because pnc is a bank holding company and blackrock is a subsidiary of pnc the company is subject to general banking regulations that limit its activities and the types of businesses in which it may engage banking regulations may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because most competitors are not subject to these limitations as a pnc subsidiary the company is subject to the supervision regulation and examination of the frb blackrock is also subject to the broad enforcement authority of the frb including the frb’s power to prohibit the company from engaging in any activity that in the frb’s opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business the frb also may impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking regulations 

blackrock could lose existing executive senior management or investment contracts if there is a change of control of pnc or blackrock 

upon a change of control of pnc or blackrock pnc blackrock or any successor to pnc or blackrock may be required to offer to purchase the capital stock held by employee and public stockholders upon a change of control of pnc or blackrock existing management may leave and new management could be appointed in addition in the event of such a change of control of pnc or blackrock the boards of registered investment companies will have to reapprove the company’s investment management contracts moreover blackrock’s advisory clients must consent to such change of control or may choose to terminate their agreements 

the foregoing risks are not exhaustive and new risks may emerge that affect blackrock’s businesses it is impossible for management to predict such future risks and therefore forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of future results

income tax expense was 523 million and 952 million representing effective tax rates of 267 and 380 for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the decline in the company’s effective tax rate was primarily attributable to net income benefits of approximately 181 million associated with the resolution of an audit performed by new york state on the company’s state income tax returns filed from 1998 through 2001 and the release of reserves allocated to the company’s new york city tax liability due to the receipt of a favorable preliminary audit finding for the 19982000 tax years 

net income 

net income totaled 1431 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and included the aftertax impact of ltip awards to be funded by a capital contribution of stock by pnc totaling 536 million and a 06 million aftertax impact of professional fees associated with the ssr acquisition recorded during the year partially offset by 181 million in previouslydiscussed income tax benefits and the 16 million increase related to the company’s sale of its interest in trepp llc exclusive of these items net income increased 223 million or 144 compared with 1554 million for the year ended december 31 2003

 contractual obligations commitments and contingencies continued 

purchase price contingencies 

in january 2005 the company closed its acquisition of ssr from metlife for adjusted consideration of approximately 2651 million in cash and 550000 restricted shares of class a common stock not including certain additional contingent payments the stock purchase agreement provides for an additional payment to metlife of up to 750 million based on the company achieving specified aum retention levels and runrate revenue levels for the year ended january 31 2006 based on aum levels and runrate revenue as of january 31 2006 the company’s additional liability on this contingency is 500 million this amount has been included in the contractual obligations table above 

in addition the stock purchase agreement provides for two other contingent payments as of march 31 2006 metlife will receive 325 of performance fees earned on a specific large institutional real estate client as of december 31 2005 no performance fees had been earned on this institutional real estate client as the measurement period has not concluded such contingent payment however is subject to market fluctuations and other variables and the ultimate amount payable to metlife if any could differ significantly this contingency has also been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to its inherent uncertainty 

in addition on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the ssr transaction metlife could receive an additional payment up to a maximum of 100 million based on the company’s retained aum associated with the metlife defined benefit and defined contribution plans this contingency has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to its inherent uncertainty 

these provisions were negotiated independently of the initial purchase price which was less than ssr’s enterprise value as determined by the company’s management in conjunction with an independent third party valuation services firm as of december 31 2005 the company was unable to estimate the potential obligations under the contingent payments because it was unable to predict what the specific retention levels of runrate revenue would be on january 31 2006 what the ultimate amount of performance fees to be earned will be as of the calculation date on the large institutional client or what the company’s retained aum will be on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the ssr transaction

conversion costs 

as a part of the ssr acquisition the company acquired realty which has a management contract to manage tower fund “tower” an openend commingled real estate separate account as currently structured tower cannot have a noninsurance adviser and as such blackrock currently acts as a subadviser to the fund the company is attempting to transfer the assets and investors of tower to a reit structure whereby blackrock would be able to manage the fund directly the company will incur transfer taxes during the conversion process based on the market value of the assets on the date of conversion as well as other conversion costs the total of which could amount to 100 million or more if the conversion is completed it is expected to take place in 2006 as the conversion costs are dependent upon the market value of assets in the tower fund on the conversion date the ultimate liability was not estimable at december 31 2005 and as such this obligation has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above and from blackrock’s consolidated financial statements 

indemnifications

the company’s management has performed an assessment of its variable interest in pillars a collateral management agreement and the credit default swap under fasb interpretation no 46r and has concluded the company is not pillar’s primary beneficiary pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended the company carries the pillars credit default swap at fair value based on the expected future cash flows under the arrangement the company recorded a loss of 02 million in nonoperating income in the consolidated statement of income related to changes in the fair value of this embedded credit default swap during the year ended december 31 2005 at december 31 2005 the fair value of the pillars credit default swap was approximately 47 million and was included in other assets on the consolidated statement of financial condition 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ significantly from those estimates management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to an informed review of blackrock’s consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

investments 

consolidation equity method and cost method 

the accounting method used for the company’s investments is generally dependent upon the influence the company has on its investee for investments where blackrock has control over the financial and operating policies of the investee which is generally shown through a 50 or greater ownership in voting interest the investee is consolidated into blackrock’s financial statements for certain investments where the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interest “variable interest entities” an investee may be consolidated if blackrock is considered the primary beneficiary of the investee 

for investments where blackrock does not control the investee or is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee the company uses the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting for investments blackrock’s share of the investee’s underlying net income is recorded in earnings and dividends or distributions subsequently received reduce the company’s investment balance

investments continued 

consolidation equity method and cost method continued 

for equity investments where blackrock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are readily marketable the investments are classified as either trading or availableforsale securities based upon management’s purpose for making the investment trading securities are those investments which are bought principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in nonoperating income in the consolidated statements of income during the period of the change availableforsale securities are those securities which are not classified as trading securities availableforsale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded to the other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change 

for equity investments where blackrock neither controls nor has significant influence over the investee and which are nonmarketable the investments are accounted for using the cost method of accounting under the cost method dividends received are recorded as nonoperating income for investments in funds and as other income for investments in operating or advisory companies 

debt securities are classified as either heldtomaturity or as availableforsale based upon management’s purpose for making the investment if the company has the ability and intent to hold a debt security to its maturity the security is classified as heldtomaturity and is recorded at its amortized cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition if the company has no intent to hold the debt security to maturity or is unable to do so the security is classified as availableforsale and recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in the other comprehensive income component of equity in the period of the change 

income on the company’s investments in cdos is recorded based upon the cdo’s projected investment yield expected future cash flows for the cdo are reviewed periodically and changes in the yield are recorded prospectively investment income for these investments is recorded in nonoperating income on the consolidated statements of income 

occasionally the company will acquire a controlling equity interest in a sponsored investment fund as a seed investment all of the consolidated funds’ investments are carried at fair value with corresponding changes in the securities’ fair values reflected in other income in the company’s consolidated statements of income in the absence of a publicly available market value fair value for an investment is estimated in good faith by the company’s management based on such factors as the liquidity financial condition and current and projected operating performance of the investment and in the case of private investment fund investments the net asset value as provided by the private investment fund’s investment manager when the company can no longer control these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for under another accounting method as appropriate

 critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

investments continued 

consolidation equity method and cost method continued 

the evaluation of the control or significant influence that blackrock may exert over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant management judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment the terms and structure of the investment agreement the terms of blackrock’s advisory agreement with the investment and any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investment further with regard to variable interest entities significant judgment is required in the determination of whether the company is the primary beneficiary if the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary the investment will be consolidated within blackrock’s financial statements in order to determine whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity management must make significant estimates and assumptions of probable future cash flows and assign probabilities to different cash flow scenarios assumptions made in such analyses include but are not limited to market prices of securities market interest rates potential credit defaults on individual securities or default rates on a portfolio of securities gain realization liquidity or marketability of certain securities discount rates and the probability of certain other outcomes all of these assumptions require management’s qualitative judgment and actual results could differ significantly 

fair value 

blackrock has a number of investments which require fair value accounting under generally accepted accounting principles for certain investments including blackrock’s cdo investments reductions in the fair value affect net income in the period of the change for investments classified as availableforsale changes in fair value are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and generally do not directly impact blackrock’s net income until such investments are sold marketable securities are generally priced using publicly available market data or external pricing services nonmarketable securities however are generally priced internally using a variety of methods and resources the company’s investments in cdos for example are valued using projections of future cash flows involving similar assumptions and management judgment as in the primary beneficiary analysis for variable interest entities described above other investments are valued using internal valuation models which utilize available market data and management assumptions the assumptions inherent in these fair value estimates require significant management judgment and actual values could differ significantly which could materially impact blackrock’s financial statements as of december 31 2005 blackrock had 257 million of cdo investments and 581 million of other investments carried at fair value whose changes in fair value impact the consolidated statement of income 

when launching a new fund the company will on occasion provide seed capital to the fund so that it may make investments and establish an investment history before being marketed to investors in such circumstances the company will usually own 100 of the fund until it is offered to external investors and as such these funds are consolidated in blackrock’s financial statements investments within such funds are carried at fair value with changes in fair value impacting the company’s statement of income investments within these seed funds may be marketable or nonmarketable depending upon the type of fund being established fair value of nonmarketable funds is generally determined by the fund manager using similar models assumptions and judgment as noted above

impairment of securities 

the company’s management periodically assesses impairment on its investments if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist consolidated investments and investments carried under the equity and cost methods of accounting are evaluated using market values where available or models assumptions and judgements as noted above if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the company’s carrying value of the investment an impairment charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income in the amount of the discounted value of the impairment 

when the fair values availableforsale securities are lower than their cost or amortized cost values the company evaluates the securities to determine whether the impairment is considered other than temporary in making this determination the company considers among other factors the length of time the security has been in a loss position the extent to which the security’s market value is less than its cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery if the impairment is considered other than temporary a charge is recorded to the consolidated statements of income 

the company reviews its cdo investments for impairment periodically throughout the term of the investment the company estimates the fair value of its cdo investments using the present value of future cash flows if the estimated future cash flows are lower than the previous estimate an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value 

evaluations of impairments of securities involve significant assumptions and management judgments which could differ from actual results and these differences could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated statement of income 

intangible assets 

at december 31 2005 the carrying amounts of the company’s intangible assets are as follows 

 

 the value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary mutual funds is classified as an indefinitelife intangible asset the assignment of indefinite lives to proprietary mutual fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  indefinite intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized finitelived management contracts are amortized over their expected useful lives which at december 31 2005 ranged from one to twenty years 

the company assesses its indefinitelived management contracts and goodwill for impairment at least annually considering factors such as projected cash flows and revenue multiples to determine whether the values of each asset are impaired and whether the indefinitelife classification is still appropriate the fair value of indefinitelife intangible assets and goodwill is determined based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows the fair values of finitelived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually using an undiscounted cash flow analysis if an asset is impaired the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined

 critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

intangible assets continued 

expected future cash flows are estimated using many variables which require significant management judgment including market interest rates equity prices credit default ratings discount rates revenue multiples inflation rates and aum growth rates actual results could differ materially from these estimates which could materially impact the impairment conclusion in 2004 the company recorded an impairment of 61 million with regard to an acquired management contract no such impairments were recorded in 2005 in addition management judgment is required to estimate the period that intangible assets will contribute to the company’s cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the company’s amortization expense which was 75 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

revenue recognition 

investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or in the case of certain real estate separate accounts net operating income generated by the underlying properties and are affected by changes in aum including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions investment advisory and administration fees for mutual funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to expense limitations certain real estate fees are earned upon the acquisition or disposition of properties in accordance with applicable investment management agreements and are recognized at the closing of the respective real estate transactions 

the company also receives performance fees or incentive allocations from alternative investment products and certain separate accounts these performance fees are earned upon attaining specified investment return thresholds such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period 

blackrock provides a variety of risk management investment analytic and investment system services to customers these services are provided under the brand name blackrock solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients fees earned for blackrock solutions services are either based on predetermined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services or on fixed monthly or quarterly payments the fees earned on risk management investment analytic and investment system assignments are recorded as other income in the consolidated statements of income 

certain investment advisory and administration fees calculated on the fair value of aum are subject to the risks and uncertainties noted in investments above to the extent the underlying investments are nonmarketable and as such the company’s earnings may be subject to variability based upon such estimates in addition certain revenues are based upon estimates of the fair value of aum or of net operating income available at the end of the accounting period historically adjustments to revenues arising from initial estimates have been immaterial since most of blackrock’s fee revenue is calculated on the fair value of marketable investments management can give no assurance however that these estimates would not result in a material adjustment in the future

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis management periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based upon its expected future earnings future deductibility of the asset changes in tax law and other factors if management determines that it is not probable that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future a valuation allowance may be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future this allowance will result in a charge to earnings this analysis requires significant assumptions and estimates by management and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates as of december 31 2005 the company has gross deferred tax assets of 1132 million and has recorded no valuation allowances

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of its business blackrock is primarily exposed to equity market price risk and interest rate risk 

equity market price risk 

blackrock’s investments consist primarily of blackrock funds  private investment funds and debt securities occasionally blackrock invests in new mutual funds or advisory accounts sponsored by blackrock in order to provide investable cash to the new mutual fund or advisory account to establish a performance history in certain cases blackrock maintains a controlling interest in a sponsored investment fund and the underlying securities are reflected on the company’s statement of financial conditions these investments expose blackrock to either equity price risk or interest rate risk dependent upon the underlying securities portfolio of each investment fund blackrock does not generally hold derivative securities to hedge its investments the following table summarizes the fair values of the investments exposed to equity price risk and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of those investments assuming a 10 increase or decrease in equity prices 

 

 at december 31 2005 and 2004 total investments trading of 223 million and 157 million respectively and total investments other of 245 million and 247 million respectively reflect investments held by blackrock with respect to senior employee elections under blackrock’s deferred compensation plans therefore any change in the fair value of these investments is offset by a corresponding change in the related deferred compensation liability

 interest rate risk 

the following table summarizes the fair value of the company’s investments in debt securities and funds that invest primarily in debt securities which expose blackrock to interest rate risk at december 31 2005 and 2004 the table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of these financial instruments assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve

overview continued 

  

blackrock’s business results largely reflect our position as a leading provider of fixed income asset management services to institutional clients of the 2407 billion of fixed income assets we managed at december 31 2004 approximately 2169 billion or 90 were from institutional clients with the remaining 238 billion managed in our openend and closedend fixed income mutual funds we also are among the largest managers of institutional money market funds and other cash management services we have made significant investments to expand our product offerings to include equity and alternative investment products and to enhance our ability to serve the needs of individual investors in addition we continue to invest in our blackrock solutions effort which achieved revenue growth of 37 in 2004 

  

we have generated substantial increases in assets under management which has supported strong revenue and earnings growth over time our financial condition remains strong as evidenced by sizable increases in corporate liquidity cash and investments and stockholders’ equity 

  

in january 2005 the company closed its acquisition of ssrm holdings inc ssr from metlife inc for consideration of approximately 274 million consisting of 237 million in cash and 550000 restricted shares of our class a common stock with the cash portion financed through the issuance of 250 million in convertible debentures the debentures bear interest at a rate of 2625 per annum and are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 97282 shares per 1000 principal amount representing a 325 premium from our last reported sale price on february 16 2005 

  

   

   

operating income as adjusted reflects the exclusion of longterm retention and incentive plan ltip expense to be funded by pnc 851 million and appreciation of rabbi trust assets 45 million net income and diluted earnings per share as adjusted reflect the exclusion of the pnc ltip funding obligation 537 million and 081 respectively and professional fees associated with the acquisition of ssr 06 million and 001 respectively these items were partially offset by new york state and city tax benefits 181 million and 027 respectively and the sale of our interest in trepp llc 16 million and 002 respectively 

  

management believes that adjusted operating income net income and earnings per diluted share are effective indicators of the company’s profitability and financial performance over time pnc’s ltip funding obligation has been excluded because exclusive of the impact related to ltip participants’ put options these noncash charges will not impact blackrock’s book value appreciation on rabbi trust assets associated with our deferred compensation plans has been excluded because investment performance of these assets has a nominal impact on all of these indicators the remaining items disclosed above which have been deemed nonrecurring by management have been excluded to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods

while we operate in a global marketplace characterized by market volatility and economic uncertainty we believe the following factors position us well to produce solid relative returns for stockholders over time

products 

  

blackrock offers a wide variety of fixed income cash management equity and alternative investment products revenue from these products consists of advisory fees typically structured as a percentage of assets managed and in some instances performance fees expressed as a percentage of returns realized in excess of agreedupon targets 

  

fixed income 

  

blackrock’s fixed income business continued to expand in 2004 as assets under management increased 12 to 2407 billion at december 31 2004 we offer investors a broad range of products that span global bond markets and sectors as well as various maturities along the yield curve all portfolios are managed by blackrock’s fixed income team which is comprised of sector specialists who help formulate broad investment strategy and implement sectorspecific themes in accordance with each portfolio’s investment objectives and guidelines our investment professionals are supported by extensive analytical tools and a shared research database that includes reports from both equity and credit analysts throughout the firm investment operations are facilitated by blackrock’s proprietary portfolio management system aladdin ®  and by our experienced team of operations administration and compliance professionals 

  

blackrock’s fixed income portfolio management team has achieved competitive investment performance by consistently employing a disciplined process designed to add incremental returns in excess of our benchmarks eightyeight percent or more of our institutional composites outperformed their benchmarks and 89 or more of taxable bond fund assets ranked in the top half of their lipper peer groups for the 1 3 5 7 and 10year periods ended december 31 2004 

  

net new business in 2004 totaled 233 billion before giving effect to 77 billion of outflows resulting from client mergers and corporate events new assignments spanned our product base resulting in greater diversification within fixed income core bond mandates for example have grown at a compound annual rate of 19 over the past five years to 945 billion at december 31 2004 over the same period targeted duration and global bond assets have grown at an even faster pace albeit from smaller bases as a result the proportion of fixed income assets invested in targeted duration portfolios increased from 24 to 30 since 1999 and global bond mandates expanded from less than 1 to 8 of total fixed income assets over the same period

fixed income continued 

  

during the year we also further diversified our client base geographically nonus investors sought additional exposure to the us and global bond markets these clients awarded blackrock net new business of 116 billion which represented nearly threequarters of total net inflows in fixed income during the year us investors also contributed to our asset growth during the year although asset allocation initiatives were focused more heavily on absolute return and other alternative investment strategies 

  

in 2004 we achieved greater diversification across client segments as well rebalancing by pension plan sponsors abated and net inflows from taxexempt investors totaled 86 billion at december 31 2004 insurance companies and other financial institutions continued to pursue outsourcing options awarding blackrock 64 billion of net new business finally we received 653 million of net inflows from private client and mutual fund investors 

  

equity 

  

during 2004 blackrock’s equity assets under management rose 8 to 148 billion our equity products which span the risk spectrum employ either an active quantitative approach or an active fundamental approach both of which seek to add value principally through stock selection the former utilizes quantitative models to assess company data and predict expected returns on individual stocks and a portfolio construction process that targets “best ideas” while carefully controlling risks taken relative to the benchmark the latter uses company research conducted by blackrock’s equity analysts to develop views on individual stocks and a portfolio construction process that targets “best ideas” across all sectors with less emphasis on deviations from the benchmark other than the applicable capitalization range portfolios are managed by dedicated teams that benefit from shared information and a common trading systems operations administration and compliance platform 

  

international equity assets declined 8 during the year to 80 billion our edinburghbased team manages the bulk of these assets in a variety of broad and regional mandates net outflows in these products which totaled 21 billion occurred largely during the first half of the year following a period of weak performance by midyear performance had stabilized and outflows abated for the year half of our institutional composites were ranked in the top half of their peer groups in addition the blackrock funds blackrock international equity portfolio the only fund the team managed for us investors ranked in the top quartile of its peer universe for 2004 

  

domestic equity assets which include large mid and small cap core value growth and opportunities portfolios grew 35 in 2004 to 68 billion net new business of 11 billion fueled asset growth for each of our usbased portfolio management teams seventy percent of our institutional composites ranked in the top half of their peer groups and all of our active quantitative equity composites outperformed their benchmarks in 2004 in addition 74 of our mutual fund assets ranked in the top half of their peer groups and the blackrock funds investment trust portfolio formerly the blackrock funds select equity portfolio ranked as one of the five best performing large cap core equity funds for 2004

equity continued 

  

  

in august 2004 we announced the acquisition of ssr which we closed in january 2005 in part this acquisition was motivated by the opportunity to expand our equity capabilities and broaden the range of products we offer the acquisition enables us to expand resources available to investors in our small and mid cap growth value and opportunities products and to add active fundamental large cap growth and asset allocation strategies in addition ssr’s energy team joined blackrock and before closing the ssr acquisition we jointly raised 635 million in a closedend fund in december 2004 in total twenty equity investment professionals from ssr joined blackrock increasing breadth and depth in our equity business 

  

cash management 

  

blackrock provides cash management services to institutional and individual investors through a variety of money market funds and customized portfolios at yearend 2004 assets managed in these strategies totaled 781 billion up 5 from yearend 2003 net new business totaled 37 billion during the year although flows varied widely across products improved coordination between our cash management sales and investment professionals led to enhanced competitiveness of our portfolios and the introduction of selected new products tailored to meet institutional investor needs although average assets declined slightly from the prior year the decline was less than that experienced by key competitors and our market share in institutional funds increased for the first time in years 

  

money market funds represented 79 of our total cash management assets at december 31 2004 asset flows in these products can be quite volatile particularly in response to prevailing monetary policy typically when the federal reserve raises rates as they did five times in 2004 yields on direct investments reflect the increase immediately if not in anticipation while money market fund yields reflect the increase more slowly institutional investors exploit this shortterm yield differential by shifting assets out of money market funds and into direct investments as expected asset flows were volatile throughout 2004 we ended the year with net subscriptions of 37 billion across our institutional and retail funds 

  

us money market funds are highly regulated to ensure that the fund shares maintain a constant dollar net asset value these funds offer exceptional liquidity to investors but are constrained in their ability to meet broader investment objectives investors seeking yield enhancement have limited choices such as taking additional credit risk or investing in longerterm securities we work directly with clients to consider these options relative to their objectives and to offer appropriate investment alternatives inflows in customized portfolios other than securities lending totaled 30 billion in 2004 

  

pfpc trust company a subsidiary of pnc offers securities lending agent services to its mutual fund and other custody clients as well as a limited number of third party lending agent clients as an accommodation and for minimal fees blackrock manages the cash collateral generated when these clients lend the securities in their portfolios these services are most often used by equity mutual funds accordingly flows in these portfolios are highly sensitive to among other things equity market conditions in 2004 securities lending assets declined by 30 billion almost fully reversing the 35 billion increase we experienced in 2003

cash management continued 

  

  

the outlook for blackrock’s cash management business is heavily influenced by the rate environment the federal reserve raised the discount rate again in february 2005 and further tightening is expected several factors however are expected to counterbalance the effect of rising rates for example the american jobs creation act of 2004 provides incentives for multinational companies to repatriate earnings of nonus subsidiaries which is leading to increased demand for cash management products in addition european institutions are capitalizing on opportunities to utilize sterling and eurodenominated cash management funds 

  

alternative investment products 

  

alternative investment products typically seek to achieve attractive absolute returns andor return profiles minimally correlated with the broader markets blackrock offers a variety of alternatives that capitalize on established expertise throughout the firm in 2004 assets managed in these products increased 18 to 82 billion largely due to new product offerings which enabled us to achieve net inflows of 19 billion in 2004 exclusive of a 07 billion downward adjustment to reflect of the equity rather than the assets of anthracite capital inc a blackrockmanaged reit 

  

our fixed income team manages a number of alternative investment strategies using the same investment process that supports 2407 billion in traditional bond portfolios at december 31 2004 in 2004 we introduced a creditoriented hedge fund and an opportunistic fixed income product the latter is a “best ideas” strategy with broad latitude to invest across the yield curve credit curve and sectors of the global bond markets these investment strategies were wellreceived by our clients and together with our existing fixed income hedge funds attracted 13 billion of net new business during the year including assets reallocated from other portfolios managed by blackrock 

  

fixed income sector specialists manage 30 billion of assets in collateralized debt obligations cdos including 400 million raised in a new vehicle offered during 2004 cdos are structured products that typically invest in portfolios leveraged with a mix of high yield debt and bank loans blackrock invests its cdo portfolios in high yield securities and bank loans and manages the assets relative to the liabilities to maintain the integrity of the structure and the credit ratings on the debt in january 2005 a team of specialists that manages assetbacked cdos joined blackrock through the ssr acquisition expanding our cdo assets under management and adding a new dimension to our structured product offerings 

  

another of our fixed income sector teams supports real estate debt investments including several alternative investment products during 2004 we raised 311 million of capital commitments for our second real estate mezzanine debt fund including additional allocations from investors in our first fund

blackrock serves a diverse base of institutional and individual investors globally we offer our products both directly and through financial intermediaries blackrock seeks to distinguish itself by going beyond the traditional asset manager or financial system vendor relationship – we work with our clients to help them solve problems these problems can be relatively straightforward such as wanting to add or change exposure to a segment of the capital markets or more complex such as reengineering workflow processes or evaluating strategic financial management alternatives

growing global presence 

  

blackrock continues to benefit from increasing global recognition of our capabilities and expanded resources internationally during the year we were awarded 10 billion of net new business from 153 clients in 34 countries bringing total assets managed for nonus clients to 733 billion at december 31 2004 net new business in nonus clients included growth in assets managed for clients based in north america ex us asia europe as well as the middle east totaling 58 million 23 billion 12 billion and 07 billion respectively and our strategic alliances in japan and australia continued to expand nonus clients are served through our offices in new york edinburgh hong kong and tokyo as well as offices in singapore and sydney which we opened late last year to enhance client service and to expand new business efforts in those regions

during the year we had positive net new business in each of our client channels assets managed for taxexempt institutions including defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans foundations endowments and other nonprofit organizations increased 13 to 1275 billion at december 31 2004 for the year net inflows from these investors totaled 70 billion with growth in both directly managed accounts and subadvisory relationships we have long worked with pension plan sponsors and their consultants to address changing asset allocation strategies and to consider appropriate investment opportunities these clients increasingly demonstrate a preference for more services from fewer managers and we believe blackrock can benefit from this trend 

  

assets under management for taxable institutions worldwide increased 13 during 2004 to 1070 billion at yearend 2004 our insurance asset management services which include risk management and accounting services capabilities are well positioned to help these clients address industryrelated issues and meet companyspecific objectives these capabilities are equally applicable to other financial institutions which have begun seeking advice and outsourcing as a means of solving their investment challenges in a period of weak loan demand lower yields and a flatter yield curve net new business during the year included 10 billion of bank balance sheet assets in aggregate net inflows from taxable institutions totaled 153 billion before giving effect to the corporate event and mergerrelated outflows referenced earlier in addition three of our financial institutions clients retained blackrock to provide risk reporting andor investment accounting solutions 

  

flows from institutional cash management investors were volatile throughout the year largely as a result of the federal reserve’s raising of interest rates at yearend assets in our institutional cash management products were 751 billion up 8 from december 31 2003 our new business effort benefited from improved coordination between sales and portfolio management resulting in 86 billion of net inflows in all products other than securities lending portfolios which experienced 30 billion of net outflows we constantly seek ways to provide innovative cash management solutions to our clients in 2004 these efforts focused on helping clients identify opportunities to more profitably invest in a low rate environment while assuming little additional risk 

  

our private client business works closely with financial intermediaries and advisors to offer our openend mutual fund family blackrock funds and to develop closedend funds that enable individual investors to capitalize on market opportunities during the year our efforts led to 22 billion of net subscriptions through third party distributors including 15 billion in closedend funds bringing private client assets to 321 billion at yearend in december we raised 635 million in a closedend equity fund offered jointly with ssr expanding the scale and scope of our mutual fund activities was one of the key strategies for pursuing our acquisition of ssr in january 2005 we merged ssr’s openend funds into blackrock funds creating a broader product lineup and more than doubling our distribution and shareholder servicing resources increasing regulatory costs are driving the need for greater scale in mutual funds

assets under management for taxable institutions worldwide increased 13 during 2004 to 1070 billion at yearend we continued to benefit from our leadership position in insurance asset management an outgrowth of our unique ability to bundle investment management risk management and accounting services to help clients address industryrelated issues and meet companyspecific objectives these capabilities are equally applicable to other financial institutions which have begun seeking advice and outsourcing as a means of solving their investment challenges in a period of weak loan demand lower yields and a flatter yield curve net new business during the year included 10 billion of bank balance sheet assets a relatively small amount but evidence of what we expect to be a growing trend in aggregate inflows from taxable institutions totaled 153 billion before giving effect to the corporate event and mergerrelated outflows referenced earlier in addition four of our financial institutions clients retained blackrock to provide risk reporting andor investment accounting solutions 

  

flows from institutional cash management investors were volatile throughout the year largely as a result of the federal reserve’s tightening stance at yearend assets in our institutional cash management products were 751 billion up 8 from december 31 2003 our new business effort benefited from improved coordination between sales and portfolio management resulting in 86 billion of net inflows in all products other than securities lending portfolios which experienced 30 billion of net outflows we constantly seek ways to provide innovative cash management solutions to our clients in 2004 these efforts focused on helping clients identify opportunities to more profitably invest in a low rate environment while assuming little additional risk we also are frequently commended for our flexible and responsive client service which is conducted through our call center and online account management tools we believe that these efforts together with competitive yields on our products will enable us to better withstand volatility in asset flows continue to build our client base and increase our market share over time 

  

our private client business works closely with financial intermediaries and advisors to offer our openend mutual fund family blackrock funds  and to develop closedend funds that enable individual investors to efficiently capitalize on market opportunities during the year our efforts led to 22 billion of net subscriptions through third party distributors including 15 billion in new closedend funds bringing private client assets to 321 billion at yearend notably in december we raised 635 million in a closedend equity fund offered jointly with state street research ssr expanding the scale and scope of our mutual fund activities was one of the key motivations for pursuing our acquisition of ssr in january 2005 we merged ssr’s openend funds into blackrock funds  creating a broader product lineup and more than doubling our distribution and shareholder servicing resources increasing regulatory costs are driving the need for greater scale in mutual funds with the ssr acquisition we believe we are better positioned than ever before to work with a broader universe of financial intermediaries and advisors to achieve meaningful organic growth in products designed to meet the needs of individual investors

risks 

  

as a leading investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks as previously discussed in this report risk management is considered to be of paramount importance to blackrock’s daytoday operations consequently blackrock devotes significant resources across all its operations to the identifying measuring monitoring managing and analyzing market and operating risks including investments in personnel and technology 

  

risks related to our business 

  

change in the securities markets could lead to a decline in our revenues 

  

our investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management and in some cases performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on assets under management a decline in the prices of stocks or bonds could cause our revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by 

  

   

   

   

   

poor investment performance could lead to loss of our clients and a decline in our revenues 

  

we believe that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the growth of our assets under management poor investment performance relative to the portfolio benchmarks and to our competitors could impair our revenues and growth because 

  

   

   

   

   

loss of key employees could lead to loss of clients and a decline in our revenues 

  

our ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to our growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients the market for qualified fund managers investment analysts financial advisers and other professionals is competitive there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel we have encouraged the continued retention of our executives and other key personnel through measures such as providing deferred compensation and competitive annual and longterm compensation arrangements and in the case of our chairman and chief executive officer an employment agreement however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining all of our key personnel loss of a significant number of key personnel could have an adverse effect on us

risks related to our business continued 

  

failure to comply with government regulations could result in fines or temporary or permanent prohibitions on our activities which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline 

  

our business is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and certain of our activities are subject to the laws of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies or bodies recently the securities and exchange commission sec and other governmental agencies have been investigating the mutual fund industry the sec has adopted and proposed various rules and legislation has been passed in congress the effect of which will further regulate the mutual fund industry and impose additional compliance obligations and costs for fulfilling such obligations on us violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines temporary or permanent prohibition of our engagement in certain activities reputational harm suspensions of our personnel or revocation of their licenses suspension or termination of our investment adviser or brokerdealer registrations or other sanctions which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline 

  

certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended the investment advisers act and our mutual funds are registered with the sec under the investment company act of 1940 as amended the investment company act the investment advisers act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers including recordkeeping operating and marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes similar obligations as well as additional detailed operational requirements on investment advisers to registered investment companies the failure of one of our subsidiaries to comply with the investment advisers act or the investment company act could cause the sec to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts including censure termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to secregistered funds and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to our reputation any of which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline 

  

failure to maintain our technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in our revenues 

  

a key element to our continued success is our ability to maintain our technological advantage both in terms of operational efficiency and in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into our operating systems that support our investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients moreover our technological advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data to us the failure of these third parties to provide such data could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact our ability to provide services to our blackrock solutions clients there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in these systems and processes 

  

loss of significant separate accounts would decrease our revenues 

  

we had approximately 480 separate account clients on december 31 2004 of which the ten largest excluding alternative investment products and blackrock solutions clients generated approximately 8 of our total revenues as of december 31 2004 our clients may terminate investment management contracts or withdraw funds on short notice a change of control of blackrock or pnc may also require reapproval by registered investment companies of their investment management contracts with us loss of any of these accounts would reduce our revenues we have from time to time lost separate accounts because of corporate mergers and restructurings and in the future we could lose accounts under these or other circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance

risks related to our business continued 

  

concentration of pncrelated assets in total assets under management could result in loss of revenue if the pncrelated assets are withdrawn by pnc or pncrelated accounts 

  

approximately 9 302 billion at december 31 2004 of our assets under management are assets related to pnc pnc or pncrelated accounts generated 645 million or 9 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 pnc or pncrelated accounts may withdraw these assets at any time and we may not be able to replace them in addition we may not be successful in increasing sales through pnc channels and pnc may determine not to continue using or making available our products during the year ended december 31 2004 we incurred 183 million of fund administration and servicing costs paid to pnc 3 of total expense on pncrelated assets 

  

competitive fee pressures could reduce our revenues and our profit margins 

  

the investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry to the extent that we are forced to compete on the basis of price we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause our revenues and profit margins to decline 

  

performance fees may increase earnings volatility which could decrease our stock price 

  

a portion of our revenues are derived from performance fees on some investment and risk management advisory assignments in most cases performance fees are based on investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally we are entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if we do not exceed these targets we will not generate performance fees for that period and if targets are based on cumulative returns we may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns causing our earnings to be more volatile than if we did not manage assets on a performance fee basis the volatility in our earnings may decrease our stock price performance fees represented 6 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

our corporate or acquisition strategies may decrease our earnings and harm our competitive position 

  

we employ a variety of strategies intended to enhance our earnings and expand our product offerings to improve our profit margins these strategies have included smallersized liftouts of investment teams and acquisitions of investment management businesses in general our strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement our strategies may decrease our earnings and harm our competitive position in the investment management industry in the event we pursue meaningful acquisitions we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and we may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from this acquisition 

  

the expected benefits of our recent acquisition of ssr may not be realized 

  

we acquired ssr from metlife inc on january 31 2005 we cannot assure you that ssr will be successfully combined into blackrock if we cannot successfully integrate these operations our business could be materially adversely affected the acquisition involves combining two companies that have previously operated separately into one unified company the combination of blackrock with ssr involves a number of risks including

risks related to our business continued 

  

   

   

   

because of difficulties in combining operations we may not be able to realize the revenue growth and other benefits that we hope to achieve from the acquisition in addition we may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on the development and expansion of our business and services 

  

failure to develop effective business resiliency plans could disrupt operations and cause financial losses which could decrease our stock price 

  

we are dependent on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer and telecommunications systems a disaster such as water damage an explosion or a prolonged loss of electrical power could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause a decline in our stock price 

  

failure to implement effective information security policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in our earnings or stock price 

  

we are dependent on the effectiveness of our information security policies procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a hacker attack or a virus or worm or an internally caused issue such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt our business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause a decline in our earnings or stock price 

  

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations both of which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline 

  

when clients retain us to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf they specify guidelines or contractual requirements that we are required to observe in the provision of our services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to our reputation or to the client seeking to recover losses from us reducing its assets under investment or risk management or terminating its contract with us any of which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline 

  

we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the global financial and equity markets 

  

we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the domestic and global financial and equity markets due to the continuing threat of terrorism and the recent reports of accounting irregularities at certain public companies declines in these markets have caused in the past and would cause in the future a decline in our revenue and income 

  

 15  

   

risks related to our business continued 

  

failure to comply with erisa regulations could result in penalties against us and cause our earnings or stock price to decline 

  

our asset management subsidiaries are subject to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 or erisa and to regulations promulgated thereunder insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under erisa with respect to benefit plan clients erisa and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa prohibit specified transactions involving erisa plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions the failure of any of our subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties against us that could reduce our earnings or cause our stock price to decline 

  

risks related to our affiliation with pnc 

  

our largest stockholder pnc controls a majority of the outstanding voting power of our common stock and our other stockholders will be unable to affect the outcome of stockholder voting while pnc remains the majority stockholder 

  

four of our 13 directors are directors andor executive officers of pnc and as of december 31 2004 pnc indirectly owned approximately 71 of our outstanding common stock representing approximately 84 of the combined voting power of all of our classes of voting stock as long as pnc owns a majority of the voting power of our common stock pnc will be able to elect our entire board of directors and to remove any director with or without cause and generally to determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval additionally our amended and restated bylaws provide that subject to applicable law and rules of the new york stock exchange “nyse” prior to the date on which pnc or another person beneficially owns less than a majority of the voting power of our common stock a majority of all directors on the committees of our board of directors will be designated by pnc or such other person as a result subject to the power of executive management to manage our daytoday operations pnc will be in a position to continue to control all matters affecting us including

risks related to our affiliation with pnc continued 

  

banking regulation of pnc and blackrock limits our activities and the types of businesses in which we may engage 

  

effective january 18 2005 pnc’s ownership in blackrock was transferred to pnc bancorp inc the transfer was effected primarily to give blackrock more operating flexibility particularly in anticipation of its acquisition of ssr because pnc is a bank holding company and we are a subsidiary of pnc we are subject to general banking regulations that limit our activities and the types of businesses in which we may engage banking regulations may cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage because most of our competitors are not subject to these limitations as a pnc subsidiary we are subject to the supervision regulation and examination of the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb” we are also subject to the broad enforcement authority of the frb including the frb’s power to prohibit us from engaging in any activity that in the frb’s opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business the frb may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of banking regulations applicable to us 

  

we could lose existing executive and senior management and investment contracts if there is a change of control of pnc or blackrock 

  

upon a change of control of pnc or blackrock pnc blackrock or any successor to pnc or blackrock may be required to offer to purchase all our capital stock held by our employee stockholders and by public stockholders upon a change of control of pnc or blackrock our existing management may leave and new management could be appointed in addition in the event of such a change of control of pnc or blackrock the boards of registered investment companies will have to approve our investment management contracts moreover our advisory clients must consent to such change of control or terminate their agreements with us 

  

the foregoing risks are not exhaustive and new risks may emerge that affect blackrock’s businesses it is impossible for management to predict such future risks and therefore forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of future results 

  

competition 

  

blackrock competes with investment management firms mutual fund complexes insurance companies banks brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to or alternatives to those offered by blackrock in order to grow our business blackrock must be able to compete effectively for assets under management key competitive factors include investment performance track records investment style and discipline client service and brand name recognition we have historically competed principally on the basis of our longterm investment performance track record our investment process our risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of our client service we have succeeded in growing aggregate assets under management and we believe that we will continue to be able to do so by focusing on strong investment performance and client service and by developing new products and new distribution capabilities many of our competitors however have greater financial or marketing resources and better brand name recognition than blackrock these factors may place blackrock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain our existing assets and attract new business will be successful 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2004 blackrock had 1020 fulltime professionals including 163 professionals in the portfolio management group 327 professionals in blackrock solutions  228 professionals in the separate account and funds marketing and client service areas and 302 professionals in executive administrative and support functions

regulation 

  

virtually all aspects of blackrock’s business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations some of which are summarized below these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients stockholders of registered investment companies pnc’s bank subsidiaries and bank customers of pnc bank national association pnc bank under these laws and regulations agencies that regulate investment advisers and banks and their subsidiaries such as blackrock and its subsidiaries have broad administrative powers including the power to limit restrict or prohibit the regulated entity from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time revocation of investment adviser and other registrations censures and fines 

  

blackrock’s subsidiaries are subject to regulation primarily at the federal level by the sec the department of labor comptroller of the currency occ frb the financial services authority the commodity futures trading commission cftc and other regulatory bodies 

  

the investment advisers act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as blackrock including recordkeeping requirements operational requirements marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes similar obligations as well as detailed operational requirements on investment advisers such as blackrock to registered investment companies and other managed accounts the sec is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the investment advisers act and the investment company act ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations 

  

blackrock’s subsidiaries also are subject to erisa and to regulations promulgated thereunder insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under erisa with respect to benefit plan clients erisa and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa prohibit certain transactions involving erisa plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions 

  

two of blackrock’s subsidiaries are registered as commodity pool operators with the cftc and the national futures association nfa and one of those subsidiaries is also registered as a commodity trading advisor the cftc and nfa each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments in which certain blackrock clients may invest two of blackrock’s other subsidiaries are registered with the sec as brokerdealers and are memberfirms of the national association of securities dealers inc nasd each brokerdealer’s respective nasd membership agreement limits its permitted activities to the sale of investment company securities and certain private placements of securities and in the case of blackrock investments inc certain investment banking and financial consulting activities although both brokerdealers have limited business activities they are both subject to the customer dealing reporting and other requirements of the nasd as well as the net capital and other requirements of the sec 

  

blackrock’s international operations are also subject to the laws of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies or bodies as blackrock has expanded its international business various of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems comparable to those affecting its operations in the united states blackrock’s international subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination by these regulatory agencies and have developed comprehensive compliance systems in order to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory frameworks could have a material adverse effect on blackrock

regulation continued 

  

pnc is a bank holding company and as discussed below is also a “financial holding company” regulated by the frb as a subsidiary of pnc blackrock is subject to most banking laws regulations and orders that are applicable to pnc and therefore to the supervision regulation and examination of the frb as well as the sec the frb also has broad enforcement authority over pnc and its subsidiaries including the power to prohibit pnc or any subsidiary from engaging in any activity that in the frb’s opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business and to impose substantial fines and other penalties supervision and regulation of pnc and its subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of pnc bank depositors the deposit insurance funds of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or creditors of national banks or their subsidiaries 

  

because blackrock is a subsidiary of pnc a regulated financial services firm pnc’s relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of our business the frb sec and other domestic and foreign regulators have broad enforcement powers and powers to approve deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices of pnc or its subsidiaries to conduct new activities acquire or divest businesses or assets or reconfigure existing operations in addition pnc and its bank subsidiaries are subject to examination by various regulators which results in examination reports and ratings which are not publicly available that can impact the conduct and growth of our businesses these examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations but also capital levels asset quality and risk management ability and performance earnings liabilities and various other factors an examination downgrade by any of the federal bank regulators of pnc or its subsidiaries potentially can result in the imposition of limitations on certain of our activities and on our growth 

  

as a subsidiary of pnc blackrock may not conduct new activities establish a subsidiary or acquire the stock or assets of another company unless the activity subsidiary stock or assets involve a business authorized for a financial holding company under the provisions of the bank holding company act a nonbank subsidiary of a financial holding company may engage in insurance underwriting insurance investment and merchant banking activities as well as permissible financial activities including investment management with respect to most nonus activities or investments blackrock must provide notice to andor obtain the approval of the frb the frb will approve only those activities that are usual in connection with the transaction of the business of banking or other financial operations outside of the united states investment management firms with which blackrock competes commonly invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which they provide services blackrock may invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory administrative or other services to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations including applicable banking laws blackrock’s current domestic and overseas activities are permissible for a financial holding company 

  

pursuant to the grammleachbliley act the glb act a qualifying bank holding company may become a financial holding company and engage in a broad range of financial activities a bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is “well capitalized” is “well managed” and has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act pnc became a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 

  

the frb is the “umbrella” supervisor for financial holding companies in addition the financial holding company’s operating entities such as its subsidiary brokerdealers investment managers investment companies banks and other regulated institutions are also subject to the jurisdiction of various state and federal “functional” regulators 

  

under federal law pnc bank and its subsidiaries generally may not engage in transactions with pnc or its nonbank subsidiaries except on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same as those prevailing for comparable transactions involving nonaffiliated companies or in the absence of comparable transactions that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies 

  

 19  

   

regulation continued 

  

in addition certain transactions including loans and other extensions of credit guarantees investments and asset purchases between pnc bank and its subsidiaries on the one hand and pnc and its nonbank subsidiaries including blackrock on the other hand are limited to 10 of pnc bank’s capital and loan loss reserve allowance for transactions with a single company and to 20 of pnc bank’s capital and loan loss reserve allowance for aggregate transactions with pnc and all its nonbank subsidiaries and other affiliates in certain circumstances federal regulatory authorities may impose more restrictive limitations such extensions of credit with limited exceptions must be fully collateralized these affiliate transaction restrictions also apply in some cases to loans or other transactions between pnc bank on the one hand and investment funds advised by blackrock on the other 

  

the fdic could be appointed as conservator or receiver of pnc bank if the bank were to become insolvent or if other conditions or events were to occur the fdic would also have the authority to repudiate contracts by pnc bank including servicing or other contracts with blackrock at any time within 180 days of its appointment as conservator or receiver and would be obligated to pay blackrock only “actual direct compensatory damages” not including damages for lost profits or opportunity as of the date of conservatorship or receivership as a result of such repudiation the fdic could also disregard without paying damages any contract that tended to diminish or defeat the fdic’s interest in any pnc bank asset if the contract were not 

  

   

   

   

   

in addition the fdic could obtain a stay of up to 90 days of any judicial action or proceeding involving pnc bank and could require blackrock to exhaust its remedies under fdic claims procedures before pursuing any available judicial remedy 

  

pnc’s bank subsidiaries are subject to “crossguarantee” provisions under federal law which provide that if one of these banks or thrifts fails or requires fdic assistance the fdic may assess a “commonly controlled” bank or thrift such as pnc bank for the estimated losses suffered by the fdic the fdic’s claim is superior to the claims of affiliates such as blackrock and of shareholders of the banks at december 31 2004 both of pnc’s bank subsidiaries exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well capitalized” under statutory and regulatory standards 

  

blackrock is subject to the usa patriot act of 2001 which contains the international money laundering abatement and antiterrorist financing act of 2001 that act contains antimoney laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain financial institutions the act requires us financial institutions to adopt policies and procedures to combat money laundering and grants the secretary of the treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions’ operations blackrock has established policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the act and the related regulations 

  

 20  

   

regulation continued 

  

additional legislation changes in rules promulgated by the sec other federal and state regulatory authorities and selfregulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of blackrock the profitability of blackrock could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce in addition the sec and other governmental agencies have recently been investigating the mutual fund industry the sec has adopted and proposed various rules and legislation has been passed in congress the effect of which will further regulate the mutual fund industry and impose additional compliance obligations and costs for fulfilling such obligations on blackrock 

  

the rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical accordingly the above discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be complete

a diluted earnings per share as adjusted has been derived from the company’s consolidated financial statements as follows 

  

   

management believes that earnings per diluted share as adjusted is an effective indicator of the company’s profitability and financial performance over time the ltip expense associated with awards to be met by pnc’s funding requirement has been excluded from earnings per diluted share as adjusted because exclusive of the impact related to ltip participants’ put options these noncash charges will not impact blackrock’s book value the remaining items which have been deemed nonrecurring by management have been excluded from earnings per diluted share as adjusted to help ensure the comparability of this information to prior reporting periods

we believe that operating margin as reported is an effective indicator of management’s ability to effectively employ the company’s resources appreciation on rabbi trust assets related to the company’s deferred compensation plans has been excluded because investment performance of these assets has a nominal impact on net income fund administration and servicing costs have been excluded from operating margin because these costs fluctuate based on the discretion of a third party

general 

  

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of assets under management and are affected by changes in assets under management including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets additional fundings from existing clients withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on and changes in the fair value of securities held in client accounts 

  

investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and blackrock’s alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on assets under management performance fees generally are earned when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold and accordingly may increase the volatility of blackrock’s revenue and earnings 

  

blackrock provides a variety of risk management investment analytics and investment system services to insurance companies finance companies pension funds asset managers foundations consultants mutual fund sponsors reits commercial and mortgage banks savings institutions and government agencies these services are provided under the brand name blackrock solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients fees earned for blackrock solutions services are based on a number of factors including predetermined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services and the number of individual investment accounts or on fixed monthly or quarterly payments the fees earned on risk management investment and investment system assignments are recorded as other income 

  

operating expense consists of employee compensation and benefits longterm retention and incentive plan expense fund administration and servicing costs general and administration expense amortization of intangible assets and impairment of intangible assets employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries deferred and incentive compensation and related benefit costs longterm retention and incentive plan expense reflects expenses recognized for awards granted to employees under the blackrock inc 2002 longterm retention and incentive plan “ltip” for which the company’s management has determined that full vesting is probable and related payroll taxes fund administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to pnc affiliated entities and third parties primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in the blackrock funds and blackrock closedend funds intangible assets at december 31 2004 and 2003 were approximately 1841 million and approximately 1921 million respectively with amortization expense of approximately 09 million 09 million and 08 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the impairment of intangible assets recognized during the year ended december 31 2004 represents a writeoff of an acquired management contract due to the resignation of the respective funds’ portfolio manager and the company’s liquidation of the funds intangible assets primarily reflect pnc’s acquisition of blackrock financial management lp bfm on february 28 1995 and a management contract acquired in connection with the agreement and plan of merger of core cap inc with anthracite capital inc anthracite a blackrock managed reit on may 15 2000

assets under management 

  

assets under management “aum” increased approximately 324 billion or 10 to 3418 billion at december 31 2004 compared with 3094 billion at december 31 2003 the growth in aum was attributable to an increase of 253 billion or 11 in separate accounts and an increase of 71 billion or 8 in mutual fund assets 

  

the increase in separate accounts at december 31 2004 as compared with december 31 2003 was the result of net subscriptions of 129 billion and market appreciation of 124 billion net subscriptions were primarily attributable to fixed income sales increased cash management assets and new alternative investment product issuance which totaled 148 billion 15 billion and 13 billion respectively separate account fundings were partially offset by net redemptions in cash managementsecurities lending and equity separate accounts of 31 billion and 16 billion respectively the rise in fixed income separate account assets was attributable to new client sales and increased fundings from existing clients the increase in cash management assets represents enhanced institutional marketing efforts and strong investment performance net subscriptions in alternative investment products relate primarily to the launch of a fixed income absolute return product during june 2004 which resulted in net new business of 11 billion during the year ended december 31 2004 net redemptions of equity accounts primarily reflected outflows in the company’s international equity products during the period as a result of weak relative investment performance in 2003 which substantially stabilized in the second half of 2004 market appreciation of 124 billion in separate accounts largely reflected appreciation earned on fixed income assets of 108 billion due to current income and market interest rate movements and market appreciation in equity assets of 16 billion as equity markets improved during the period 

  

the 71 billion increase in mutual fund assets since december 31 2003 primarily reflected net subscriptions of 67 billion during the year net subscriptions in the blackrock liquidity funds  blackrock closedend funds and other commingled funds totaled 56 billion 15 billion and 13 billion respectively which were partially offset by net redemptions in the blackrock funds of 20 billion net new business in the blackrock liquidity funds is primarily due to 114 billion of net subscriptions during the fourth quarter of 2004 primarily driven by strong relative investment performance partially offset by outflows attributable to increases in the federal funds rate which results in a temporary yield advantage for direct investments in the money markets versus mutual funds the increase in aum of the blackrock closedend funds reflects new funds launched during 2004 partially offset by a term trust maturity of 04 billion net subscriptions in other commingled funds resulted from the successful launch of blackrock cash strategies llc an enhancedyield cash management product during 2004 the decline in blackrock funds aum was attributable to a decision by pnc’s wealth management business to transfer approximately 2 billion of assets to the blackrock liquidity funds  

  

aum in the fourth quarter of 2004 increased 183 billion or 6 as compared to the third quarter of 2004 representing 127 billion in net subscriptions and 56 billion in market appreciation the 127 billion in net subscriptions during the period primarily reflected 113 billion in blackrock liquidity funds net subscriptions 11 billion in aum raised through blackrock cash strategies llc fixed income separate account net subscriptions of 11 billion and a 07 billion increase in alternative investment product aum primarily associated with the launches of a new collateralized debt obligation and a real estate mezzanine debt fund during the quarter asset inflows during the period were partially offset by 17 billion of net redemptions in cash managementsecurities lending separate accounts market appreciation of 52 billion in separate accounts largely reflected appreciation earned on fixed income assets of 39 billion due to current income and market interest rate movements and market appreciation in equity assets of 12 billion as equity markets improved during the period

critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates management considers the following accounting policies critical to an informed review of blackrock’s consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f10 

  

investments 

  

readily marketable securities 

  

the accounting method used for the company’s readily marketable securities is dependent upon the company’s ownership level if blackrock does not possess significant influence over the issuer’s operations the securities are classified as trading or available for sale depending on the company’s intent on holding the security if blackrock holds significant influence over the issuer of a readily marketable equity security the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in investments other company management’s conclusion that blackrock holds significant influence over an issuer whose security was previously classified as an available for sale security has a significant impact on the company’s net income due to the related accounting treatment under the equity method the company’s share of the investee’s net income is recorded in investment income loss while unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income or loss component of stockholders’ equity until the securities are sold unrealized losses incurred during the year ended december 31 2004 on readily marketable available for sale securities were less than 1 million 

  

nonmarketable equity securities 

  

investments other are accounted for using the cost or equity methods of accounting if the company has significant influence over the investee’s operations the equity method of accounting is used and the company’s share of the investee’s net income is recorded as investment income expense for alternative investment products and other income for operating joint ventures if the company does not maintain significant influence over the investee’s operations the cost method of accounting is used under the cost method of accounting investment income is recognized as received or upon the sale of the security therefore company management’s conclusion that blackrock holds significant influence over an issuer has a significant impact on the company’s net income unrealized gains on investments accounted for under the cost method totaled approximately 06 million during the year ended december 31 2004

impairment of securities 

  

the company’s management periodically assesses impairment on investments to determine if it is other than temporary 

  

several of the company’s available for sale investments represent interests in collateralized debt obligations in which the company acts in the capacity of collateral manager the company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each collateralized debt obligation to determine if an impairment charge is required to be taken through current earnings if the updated estimate of future cash flows taking into account both timing and amount is less than the last revised estimate an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value 

  

in evaluating impairments on all other available for sale and other securities the company considers the length of time and the extent to which the security’s market value if determinable has been less than its cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s intended holding period for the security 

  

blackrock long term retention and incentive plan ltip 

  

the ltip permits the grant of up to 240 million in deferred compensation awards the “ltip awards” subject to the achievement of certain performance hurdles by the company no later than march 2007 as of january 31 2005 the company has awarded approximately 230 million in ltip awards if the performance hurdles are achieved up to 200 million of the ltip awards will be funded with up to 4 million shares of blackrock common stock to be surrendered by the pnc financial services group inc “pnc” and distributed to ltip participants less income tax withholding shares attributable to value in excess of pnc’s 200 million ltip funding requirement will be available to support the company’s future longterm retention and incentive programs but are not subject to surrender by pnc until the programs are approved by the compensation committee of the company’s board of directors in addition shares distributed to ltip participants will include an option to put such distributed shares back to blackrock at fair market value blackrock will fund the remainder of the ltip awards with up to 40 million in cash 

  

under the terms of the ltip awards fully vest if blackrock’s average closing stock price is at least 62 for any 3month period beginning on or after january 1 2005 and ending on or prior to march 30 2007 in addition the vesting of awards is contingent on the participants’ continued employment with the company for periods ranging from two to five years an alternative performance hurdle provides for partial vesting of the ltip based on specific targets for the company’s earnings growth and relative stock price performance to peers over the term of the ltip subject to the authority of the company’s compensation committee to reduce the amount of awards vested under the ltip 

  

due to the recent appreciation of the company’s stock price above the 62 threshold the company’s management has determined that full vesting of ltip awards is probable and recorded a charge of 1040 million during the period reflecting ltip awards earned through december 31 2004 and related payroll taxes based on current level of ltip awards outstanding and assuming full vesting remains probable annual expense during the year ended december 31 2005 should be approximately 594 million

income taxes 

  

the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 

  

property and equipment 

  

property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation generally is provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment accelerated methods are used for income tax purposes leasehold improvements are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives or lease terms whichever is shorter a change in an asset class’s estimated useful life by management would have a significant impact on the company’s depreciation expense approximately 197 million for the year ended december 31 2004 due to the concentration of the company’s property and equipment in relatively shortlived assets useful lives of three to five years a summary of the estimated useful lives used by asset class is included in note 4 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

recent accounting developments 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards statement “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” this statement is a revision to sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supercedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services primarily focusing on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award with limited exceptions that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service the requisite service period usually the vesting period in exchange for the award the grantdate fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using optionpricing models if an equity award is modified after the grant date incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 in accordance with the standard the company will adopt sfas no 123r during the year ended december 31 2005 

  

upon adoption the company has two application methods to choose from the modifiedprospective transition approach or the modifiedretrospective transition approach under the modifiedprospective transition method the company would be required to recognize compensation cost for sharebased awards to employees based on their grantdate fair value from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as well as compensation cost for awards that were granted prior to but not vested as of the date of adoption prior periods remain unchanged and pro forma disclosures previously required by sfas no 123 continue to be required under the modifiedretrospective transition method the company would restate prior periods by recognizing compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosure under sfas no 123 under this method the company is permitted to apply this presentation to all periods presented or to the start of the fiscal year in which sfas no 123r is adopted the company would follow the same guidelines as in the modifiedprospective transition method for awards granted subsequent to adoption and those that were granted and not yet vested

the company will adopt the modifiedprospective transition approach which will reduce the company’s net income by the grantdate fair value of all unvested stock options as of the date of adoption july 1 2005 in addition diluted shares outstanding will be reduced for all shares reserved for unvested stock options expensed under sfas 123r approximately 18 million shares at december 31 2004 the adoption of sfas no 123r is expected to reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately 001 per quarter through december 31 2006 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets—an amendment of apb opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary transactions” sfas no 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21b of apb opinion no 29 “accounting for nonmonetary transactions” and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance sfas no 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange sfas no 153 is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 and will be adopted by the company for the quarter ended september 30 2005 the adoption of sfas no 153 is not expected to have a significant impact on the company’s financial statements 

  

fasb staff position “fsp” no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” “fsp 1092” provides guidance under fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “jobs act” on enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability the jobs act was enacted on october 22 2004 fsp 1092 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the company has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions accordingly as provided for in fsp 1092 the company has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 

  

the jobs act created a onetime opportunity for us companies to repatriate undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries at a substantially reduced federal tax rate the reduced rate is achieved via an 85 dividends received deduction in the company’s case foreign earnings must be repatriated by december 31 2005 in order to qualify for this benefit the company has foreign subsidiaries with approximately 30 million in undistributed earnings that may be available for repatriation there are a variety of additional technical requirements related to such factors as the use of the repatriated earnings which must be considered to take advantage of the reduced tax rate the company’s management has begun to evaluate the feasibility of repatriating the undistributed earnings of the company’s foreign subsidiaries and expects to complete its evaluation by the end of the second quarter of 2005 under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 23 “accounting for income taxes – special areas” the company has not recorded income taxes on the earnings of the foreign subsidiaries the repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries could increase the company’s income tax expense by up to 2 million during the year ended december 31 2005 

  

in december 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 revised 2003 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46r” fin 46r addresses the application of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” to variable interest entities “vie” and generally would require that the assets liabilities and results of operations of a vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in it the interpretation provides a framework for determining whether an entity should be evaluated for consolidation based on voting interests or significant financial support provided to the entity “variable interests”

recent accounting developments continued 

  

an entity is classified as a vie if total equity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity investors lack the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity’s activities through voting rights absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur or receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur once an entity is determined to be a vie its assets liabilities and results of operations should be consolidated with those of its primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a vie is the entity that either will absorb a majority of the vie’s expected losses or has the right to receive a majority of the vie’s expected residual returns the expected losses and residual returns of a vie include expected variability in its net income or loss fees to decision makers and fees to guarantors of substantially all vie assets or liabilities and are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting concept no 7 “using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements” 

  

a public enterprise with a variable interest in a vie must apply fin 46r to that vie no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march 15 2005 with the exception of special purpose entities “spes” as defined a public enterprise with a variable interest in an spe that has been deemed a vie must apply fin 46r to that vie no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after december 15 2004 additionally if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a vie when the guidance becomes effective there are several disclosure requirements effective for all financial statements issued after january 31 2004 the company has included the required disclosures for vies in which it has significant involvement in the notes to the consolidated financial statements which begin on page f10 of this filing 

  

pursuant to the conceptual framework set forth in fin 46r the company’s management has concluded that blackrock is the primary beneficiary of a strategic joint venture which was previously treated as an equity method investment the aggregate statement of financial condition for the joint venture consolidated on january 1 2004 is included in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

under previous guidance the company’s management determined that the company was the primary beneficiary of six collateralized debt obligations cdo and consolidated the results of operations financial position and cash flow for these entities during the three months ended september 30 2003 the cdos were subsequently deconsolidated under fin 46r a reconciliation of blackrock’s adjusted condensed consolidated statements of financial condition and operations as of and for the three months ended september 30 2003 to the company’s quarterly report on form 10q for the three months ended september 30 2003 is included in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements

interest rates 

  

the value of assets under management is affected by changes in interest rates since blackrock derives the majority of its revenues from investment advisory fees based on the value of assets under management blackrock’s revenues may be adversely affected by changing interest rates in a period of rapidly rising interest rates blackrock’s assets under management would likely be negatively affected by reduced asset values and increased redemptions 

  

 57  

   

inflation 

  

the majority of blackrock’s revenues are based on the value of assets under management there is no predictable relationship between the rate of inflation and the value of assets under management by blackrock except as inflation may affect interest rates blackrock does not believe inflation will significantly affect its compensation costs as they are substantially variable in nature however the rate of inflation may affect blackrock’s expenses such as information technology and occupancy costs to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets it may adversely affect blackrock’s results of operations by reducing blackrock’s assets under management revenues or otherwise

overview 

  

blackrock inc a delaware corporation formed in 1998 together with its subsidiaries “blackrock” or the “company” is one of the largest investment management firms in the united states with approximately 309 billion of assets under management at yearend 2003 for institutional and individual investors worldwide our products span a broad spectrum of fixed income liquidity equity and alternative investment separate accounts and mutual funds including our blackrock funds and blackrock liquidity funds  formerly known as blackrock provident institutional funds we also offer risk management investment analytics and investment system services to institutional investors through our blackrock solutions product line 

  

blackrock is a majority owned indirect subsidiary of the pnc financial services group inc “pnc” one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the united states as of december 31 2003 pnc indirectly owned approximately 70 of blackrock blackrock is headquartered in new york city and has offices in edinburgh scotland hong kong tokyo japan wilmington delaware san francisco california and boston massachusetts

our ability to generate growth in assets under management is the primary factor driving increases in revenue and earnings and ultimately stockholder value our strategies to deliver growth in assets under management begin with our focus on achieving client investment performance objectives while maintaining stringent risk controls and providing “best in class” client service accordingly we dedicate significant resources to attracting and retaining talented professionals which we believe is the most critical component to maintaining a dynamic growthoriented firm and to the ongoing enhancement of our investment technology and operating capabilities 

  

blackrock’s business results largely reflect our position as a leading provider of fixed income and liquidity asset management services to institutional clients of the 309 billion of assets we managed at december 31 2003 approximately 276 billion or 89 were from institutional clients with the remaining 33 billion reflecting institutional and individual client investments in our openend and closedend mutual fund families while we direct substantial resources to our fixed income and liquidity products we also incur significant expense and have made additional investments over the last two years to establish a menu of competitive equity products suitable for both institutional and individual investors additionally blackrock solutions continued to grow in 2003 achieving sales in excess of our initial expectations since its inception in 2000 during 2003 blackrock solutions revenue increased by 18 

  

we have generated substantial increases in assets under management which has resulted in strong revenue and earnings growth since our formation in 1998 our financial condition has also been enhanced with the retirement of all longterm debt in 1999 and sizable increases in corporate liquidity cash and investments and stockholders’ equity

while we continue to operate in a global marketplace characterized by market volatility and economic uncertainty we believe the following factors position us well to produce solid relative returns for stockholders

products 

  

blackrock offers a wide variety of fixed income liquidity equity and alternative investment products revenue from these products consists of advisory fees typically structured as a percentage of assets managed and in some instances performance fees expressed as a percentage of returns realized in excess of agreedupon targets 

  

fixed income 

  

fixed income remains the cornerstone of blackrock’s business representing 69 of total assets under management at yearend 2003 during the year fixed income assets grew 22 to 2144 billion net new business exceeded 284 billion with inflows in all product categories and from all client channels we expanded our capabilities across sectors adding depth to our high yield corporate credit international and insurance teams we also established a portfolio risk management group to enhance our focus on and use of risk management capabilities in our investment management activities we believe that these initiatives will strengthen our efforts and enable us to further expand and diversify our fixed income product mix over time 

  

growth in our global bond products more than doubled to 120 billion during 2003 this success was complemented by net new business of 119 billion in targeted duration accounts including insurance defined contribution and mutual fund portfolios 81 billion in core bond products and 25 billion in sectorspecific strategies such as mortgage municipal high yield and treasury inflationprotected security mandates diversification was also achieved across client channels with 94 billion of net inflows from international investors 80 billion from us taxable investors 73 billion from us taxexempt investors and 38 billion from individual and institutional mutual fund investors 

  

we believe that investment performance is and always will be the most important barometer of future business growth for the one three and five years ended december 31 2003 75 or more of our fixed income composites outperformed their benchmarks and 80 or more of our taxable bond funds achieved returns in excess of their lipper peer group medians these results reflect our intense focus on achieving strong investment performance consistent with our investment process and risk management discipline

fixed income continued 

  

numerous industry trends are favorable for blackrock pension plan rebalancing out of bonds into stocks which led to more than 19 billion of outflows over the past three years abated and began to reverse as global stock markets recovered defined benefit plan sponsors are funding shortfalls and allocating a portion of contributions to fixed income defined contribution plan sponsors are adding investment options increasingly unbundling asset management and plan administration services insurance companies continue to actively outsource investment management a trend we expect to extend to other financial institutions as well 

  

our ongoing success in fixed income is in part a direct reflection of our team effort professionals across the firm including portfolio management account management operations administration compliance and blackrock solutions  work together to provide unparalleled service to our clients our collective efforts have enabled us to achieve compound annual growth of 27 over the past five years we believe that we are well positioned to build upon our past accomplishments and to capitalize on new opportunities to expand and diversify our fixed income business in 2004 

  

liquidity 

  

blackrock is a leader in liquidity management with 743 billion under management at december 31 2003 representing 24 of blackrock’s total assets under management although yearend assets declined 5 from 2002 levels average assets were down only 2 and blackrock maintained its position as the eighth largest institutional money market fund manager in the nation during the year we added resources in liquidity sales and marketing and enhanced crossselling efforts which we believe will enable us to expand market share in 2004 

  

net outflows of 66 billion in institutional money market funds partially reversed the 143 billion of inflows that followed the federal reserve’s rate cut in november 2002 additional outflows of 14 billion in retail money market funds reflected asset reallocations during a period of historically low yields in contrast to these adverse flows improved crossselling efforts helped generate 327 million of net new business in separate accounts and favorable stock market conditions led to 35 billion of net inflows in securities lending portfolios 

  

investment performance remained competitive with all liquidity funds ranked in the top two lipper quartiles and 90 or more of all institutional funds ranked in the top lipper quartile for the one three and five years ended december 31 2003 importantly these results were achieved without compromising our conservative investment philosophy which emphasizes credit quality and liquidity over yield our investment process brings together highly experienced professionals sophisticated risk analytics customized for the needs of the liquidity business and broad global credit research capabilities 

  

consistently competitive performance has allowed us to maintain an impressive roster of clients including corporate and municipal treasurers banks and bank trust departments broker dealers and insurance companies as part of our ongoing effort to better serve our clients we provide a variety of proprietary tools to make investing in blackrock liquidity funds easy and efficient in addition to the client call center which handled approximately half of all trade orders in 2003 we offer mutualadvantage which gives clients realtime access to their accounts via the internet we also have developed interfaces that provide access to our funds through several institutional investment portals and cashmanager a pcbased cash sweep program for banks that offer cash management services

liquidity continued 

  

blackrock’s liquidity flows in 2003 reflected the prevailing rate environment outflows materialized as expected when yields on money market funds and direct investments came back into line during the first quarter throughout the year however the federal reserve maintained its accommodative stance while waiting for clear evidence of inflationary pressures we believe any shift in the federal reserve’s policy in 2004 will likely cause significant outflows in institutional money market funds in favor of direct investments accordingly we remain cautious about the volatility of liquidity flows in the coming year 

  

equity 

  

global equity markets rallied sharply in 2003 following three years of negative returns performance within the markets was mixed however with smaller capitalization higher risk stocks performing best worldwide the skewed nature of the market recovery impacted our results for the year as small cap portfolios outperformed large cap products for the year blackrock’s equity assets increased 257 million to 137 billion at yearend most importantly we ended the year with strong momentum in our domestic equity effort and signs of improvement in our international equity products 

  

domestic equity assets grew 10 billion to 50 billion at december 31 2003 during the year net new business raised from institutional investors and through external distributors totaled 712 million which was overwhelmed by 748 million of outflows from pncrelated clients importantly the positive new business efforts spanned our client base including institutional separate account and fund investors as well as the successful offering of our first equity closedend fund 

  

significantly strong investment results are supporting new business momentum all of our domestic small cap equity composites outperformed their benchmarks and all of the corresponding funds ranked in the top half of their lipper peer groups in 2003 in addition our quantitative equity team which joined the firm in february 2003 quickly implemented their models and rigorous investment process in the management of our domestic large cap portfolios their efforts enabled our large cap core equity fund blackrock funds select equity portfolio to achieve top quartile performance within its lipper peer group for the year 

  

our global opportunities team achieved strong performance for the year in international small cap products attracting net inflows from a variety of institutional investors worldwide the market environment was difficult however for our large cap international equity portfolios these products performed poorly on a relative basis and as a result redemptions outpaced market gains international equity assets ended the year down 760 million to 87 billion we remain convinced however that as markets return to more normal conditions these large cap portfolios will improve benefiting from the consistency of the style and process that have enabled our edinburghbased team to produce an exceptional longterm track record 

  

going into 2004 performance in our large cap international equity products appears to have stabilized and we have strong momentum in our domestic equity business including a robust pipeline of new business opportunities further as each of the newer teams gain more seasoning on blackrock’s platform and demonstrates their ability to deliver strong performance we will be able to more effectively introduce their products to a larger universe of prospective investors and pursue greater crossselling opportunities

products continued 

  

alternative investment products 

  

during 2003 we continued to expand our alternative investment platform adding resources and diversifying our product mix at yearend alternative investments included hedge funds fund of funds high yield and real estate debt products during the year assets increased 31 to 69 billion we continue to believe that managing alternative investments alongside longonly portfolios is beneficial and accordingly we will pursue opportunities to expand these offerings over time

institutional money market fund assets which are managed on behalf of both taxable and taxexempt investors declined 66 billion or 11 to 537 billion at yearend 2003 these outflows which were anticipated industrywide following the federal reserve’s discount rate cut in november 2002 were mitigated somewhat by net inflows of 327 million in separate accounts and 35 billion in security lending portfolios blackrock retained its position as the eighth largest institutional money market fund manager in the nation and our expanded liquidity team is focused on building market share over time

risks 

  

as a leading investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks as previously discussed in this report risk management is considered to be of paramount importance to blackrock’s daytoday operations consequently blackrock devotes significant resources across all its operations to the identification measurement monitoring management and analysis of market and operating risk including investments in personnel and technology 

  

change in the securities markets could lead to a decline in our revenues 

  

our investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management and performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on assets under management a decline in the prices of stocks or bonds could cause our revenues to decline by 

  

   

   

   

   

poor investment performance could lead to loss of our clients and a decline in our revenues 

  

we believe that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the growth of our assets under management poor investment performance relative to the portfolio benchmarks and to our competitors could impair our revenues and growth because 

  

   

   

   

loss of key employees could lead to loss of clients and a decline in our revenues 

  

blackrock’s ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to its growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients the market for qualified fund managers investment analysts financial advisers and other professionals is extremely competitive there can be no assurance that blackrock will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel blackrock has encouraged the continued retention of its executives and other key personnel through measures such as providing deferred compensation and competitive annual and longterm compensation arrangements and in the case of blackrock’s chairman and chief executive officer an employment agreement however there can be no assurance that blackrock will be successful in retaining all of its key personnel loss of a significant number of key personnel could have an adverse effect on blackrock

failure to maintain our technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in our revenues 

  

a key element to our continued success is our ability to maintain our technological advantage both in terms of operational efficiency and in supporting the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into our operating systems there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in these systems and processes 

  

loss of significant separate accounts would decrease our revenues 

  

we had approximately 455 separate account clients on december 31 2003 of which the ten largest excluding alternative investment products and blackrock solutions clients generated approximately 8 of our total revenues during 2003 our clients may terminate investment management contracts or withdraw funds on short notice a change in control of blackrock or pnc may also require reapproval by registered investment companies of their investment management contracts with us loss of any of these accounts would reduce our revenues we have from time to time lost separate accounts because of corporate mergers and restructuring and in the future we could lose accounts under these or other circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance 

  

concentration of pncrelated assets in total assets under management could result in loss of revenue if the pncrelated assets are withdrawn by pnc or pncrelated accounts 

  

approximately 10 32 billion at december 31 2003 of assets under management for blackrock are assets related to pnc pnc or pncrelated accounts generated 721 million or 12 of blackrock’s total revenue in 2003 pnc or pncrelated accounts may withdraw these assets at any time and we may not be able to replace them in addition we may not be successful in increasing sales through pnc channels and pnc may determine not to continue using or making available our products during 2003 blackrock incurred 270 million of fund administration and servicing costs paid to pnc 7 of total expense on pncrelated assets 

  

competitive fee pressures could reduce our revenues and our profit margins 

  

the investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry to the extent that we are forced to compete on the basis of price we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause our revenues and profit margins to decline 

  

performance fees may increase earnings volatility which could decrease our stock price 

  

a portion of our revenues are derived from performance fees on some investment and risk management advisory assignments in most cases performance fees are based on investment returns although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards generally we are entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreedupon periodic or cumulative return targets if we do not exceed these targets we will not generate performance fees for that period and if targets are based on cumulative returns we may not earn performance fees in future periods performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns causing our earnings to be more volatile than if we did not manage assets on a performance fee basis the volatility in our earnings may decrease our stock price performance fees represented 1 of our total revenue in 2003

our corporate or acquisition strategies may decrease our earnings and harm our competitive position 

  

we employ a variety of strategies intended to enhance our earnings and expand our product offerings to improve our profit margins these strategies have included smallersized liftouts of investment teams and acquisitions of investment management businesses in general our strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement our strategies may decrease our earnings and harm our competitive position in the investment management industry in the event we pursue meaningful acquisitions we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and we may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from these acquisitions 

  

failure to develop effective business resiliency plans could disrupt operations and cause financial losses which could decrease our stock price 

  

we are dependent on the availability of our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer and telecommunications systems a disaster such as water damage an explosion or a prolonged loss of electrical power could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause a decline in our stock price 

  

failure to implement effective information security policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses which could result in a decrease in our earnings or stock price 

  

we are dependent on the effectiveness of our information security policies procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them an externally caused information security incident such as a hacker attack or a virus or worm or an internally caused issue such as failure to control access to sensitive systems could materially interrupt our business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss regulatory actions breach of client contracts reputational harm or legal liability which in turn could cause a decline in our earnings or stock price 

  

failure to comply with client contractual requirements andor guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations both of which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline 

  

when clients retain us to manage assets or provide blackrock solutions products or services on their behalf they specify guidelines or contractual requirements that we are required to observe in the provision of our services a failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in losses that the client could seek to recover from us and the client withdrawing its assets from our management both of which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline

failure to comply with government regulations could result in fines or temporary or permanent prohibitions on our activities which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline 

  

our business is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and certain of our activities are subject to the laws of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies or bodies recently the sec and other governmental agencies have been investigating the mutual fund industry the sec has adopted and proposed various rules and legislation has been introduced in congress the effect of which will further regulate the mutual fund industry and impose additional compliance obligations and costs for fulfilling such obligations on blackrock violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines temporary or permanent prohibition of our engagement in certain activities reputational harm suspensions of our personnel or revocation of their licenses suspension or termination of our investment adviser or brokerdealer registrations or other sanctions which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline 

  

certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the securities and exchange commission sec under the investment advisers act and blackrock’s mutual funds are registered with the sec under the investment company act of 1940 the investment advisers act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers including recordkeeping operating and marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act imposes similar obligations as well as additional detailed operational requirements on investment advisers to registered investment companies the failure of one of our subsidiaries to comply with the investment advisers act or the investment company act could cause the sec to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts including censure termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to secregistered funds and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds any of which could cause our earnings or stock price to decline 

  

failure to comply with erisa regulations could result in penalties against us and cause our earnings or stock price to decline 

  

our asset management subsidiaries are subject to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 or erisa and to regulations promulgated thereunder insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under erisa with respect to benefit plan clients erisa and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa prohibit specified transactions involving erisa plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions the failure of any of our subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties against us that could reduce our earnings or cause our stock price to decline

four of our eleven directors are directors andor executive officers of pnc and as of december 31 2003 pnc indirectly owned approximately 70 of our outstanding common stock representing approximately 83 of the combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of blackrock as long as pnc owns a majority of the voting power of our common stock pnc will be able to elect our entire board of directors and to remove any director with or without cause and generally to determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval additionally our bylaws provide that subject to applicable law and rules of the new york stock exchange nyse prior to the date on which pnc or another person beneficially owns less than a majority of the voting power of blackrock common stock a majority of all directors on the committees of our board of directors will be designated by pnc or such other person as a result subject to the power of executive management to manage the daytoday operations of blackrock pnc will be in a position to continue to control all matters affecting blackrock including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

banking regulation of pnc and blackrock limits our activities and the types of businesses in which we may engage 

  

because pnc is a bank holding company and blackrock is a subsidiary of pnc and pnc bank national association its national bank subsidiary pnc bank we are subject to general bank regulations that limit our activities and the types of businesses in which we may engage banking regulations may cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage because most of our competitors are not subject to these limitations as a pnc bank subsidiary blackrock is subject to the supervision regulation and examination of the office of the comptroller of currency occ blackrock is also subject to the broad enforcement authority of the occ including the occ’s power to prohibit blackrock from engaging in any activity that in the occ’s opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business the occ may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of banking regulations applicable to blackrock some of our subsidiaries that engage in activities outside the united states are subject to regulation and supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb in addition your shares will not be insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic or guaranteed by any bank

we could lose existing executive and senior management and investment contracts if there is a change in control of pnc or blackrock 

  

upon a change in control of pnc or blackrock pnc blackrock or any successor may be required to offer to purchase all of our capital stock held by blackrock’s employee stockholders and by public stockholders upon a change in control of pnc or blackrock our existing management may leave and new management could be appointed in addition in the event of such a change in control of pnc or blackrock the boards of registered investment companies will have to approve our investment management contracts moreover our advisory clients must consent to such change of control or terminate their agreements with us 

  

the foregoing risks are not exhaustive and new risks may emerge that affect blackrock’s businesses it is impossible for management to predict such future risks and therefore forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future results 

  

competition 

  

blackrock competes with investment management firms mutual fund complexes insurance companies banks brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to or alternatives to those offered by blackrock in order to grow our business blackrock must be able to compete effectively for assets under management key competitive factors include investment performance track records investment style and discipline client service and brand name recognition we have historically competed principally on the basis of our longterm investment performance track record our investment process our risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of our client service we have succeeded in growing aggregate assets under management and we believe that we will continue to be able to do so by focusing on strong investment performance and client service and by developing new products and new distribution capabilities many of our competitors however have greater financial or marketing resources and better brand name recognition than blackrock these factors may place blackrock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain our existing assets and attract new business will be successful

the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as blackrock including recordkeeping requirements operational requirements marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act of 1940 as amended imposes similar obligations as well as detailed operational requirements on investment advisers such as blackrock to registered investment companies and other managed accounts the sec is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the investment advisers act and the investment company act ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations 

  

blackrock’s subsidiaries also are subject to erisa and to regulations promulgated thereunder insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under erisa with respect to benefit plan clients erisa and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa prohibit certain transactions involving erisa plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions 

  

one of blackrock’s subsidiaries is registered as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor with the cftc and the national futures association nfa the cftc and nfa administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments in which blackrock clients may invest another subsidiary is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer and is a member of the national association of securities dealers nasd although this entity’s nasd membership agreement limits its permitted activities to the sale of investment company securities and annuities and certain private placement and financial consulting activities it is subject to the customer dealing reporting and other requirements of the nasd as well as the net capital and other requirements of the sec 

  

blackrock’s international operations are also subject to the laws of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies or bodies as blackrock has expanded its international business various of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems comparable to those affecting its operations in the united states blackrock’s international subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination by these regulatory agencies and have developed comprehensive compliance systems in order to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements 

  

the failure of blackrock’s internal operations to comply with the applicable regulatory frameworks could have a material adverse effect on blackrock 

  

pnc is a bank holding company and as discussed below is also a “financial holding company” regulated by the frb pnc bank the indirect parent of blackrock is a national bank subsidiary of pnc as an operating subsidiary of pnc bank blackrock is subject to most banking laws regulations and orders that are applicable to pnc bank and therefore to the supervision regulation and examination of the occ as well as the sec the occ and the fdic also have broad enforcement authority over pnc bank and its subsidiaries including the power to prohibit pnc bank or any subsidiary from engaging in any activity that in the occ’s opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business to appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver of pnc bank if any of a number of conditions are met and to impose substantial fines and other penalties supervision and regulation of pnc bank and its subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance funds of the fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or creditors of national banks or their subsidiaries the frb has regulatory and supervisory authority with respect to pnc’s nonus activities and investments including nonus activities and investments of blackrock as well as with respect to pnc’s nonbank subsidiaries

regulation continued 

  

because blackrock is a subsidiary of pnc a regulated financial services firm pnc’s relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of our business the frb occ sec and other domestic and foreign regulators have broad enforcement powers and powers to approve deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices of pnc or its subsidiaries to conduct new activities acquire or divest businesses or assets or reconfigure existing operations in addition pnc and its bank subsidiaries are subject to examination by various regulators which results in examination reports and ratings which are not publicly available that can impact the conduct and growth of our businesses these examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations but also capital levels asset quality and risk management ability and performance earnings liabilities and various other factors an examination downgrade by any of the federal bank regulators of pnc or its subsidiaries potentially can result in the imposition of limitations on certain of our activities and on our growth 

  

because blackrock is a consolidated subsidiary of pnc bank federal restrictions on the payment of dividends by pnc bank might be applied to blackrock under federal law occ approval is needed before pnc bank may pay dividends in any year in which the total of all dividends paid would exceed the total of pnc bank’s net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits from the prior two years pnc bank also may not pay dividends exceeding its capital surplus 

  

as an operating subsidiary of a national bank blackrock may not conduct new activities establish a subsidiary or acquire the stock or assets of another company unless it provides notice to andor obtains the approval of the occ or with respect to most nonus activities or investments the frb the occ will generally approve only those activities and investments that are legally permissible for a national bank and consistent with prudent banking principles and regulatory policy the frb will approve only those activities that are usual in connection with the transaction of the business of banking or other financial operations outside of the united states investment management firms with which blackrock competes commonly invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which they provide services pursuant to occ authorization blackrock may invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory administrative or other services to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations including applicable banking laws blackrock’s current domestic and overseas activities are with the limited exception of the activities of blackrock’s financial subsidiaries discussed below permissible for a national bank 

  

pursuant to the grammleachbliley act the glb act a qualifying bank holding company may become a financial holding company and engage in a broad range of financial activities a bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is “well capitalized” is “well managed” and has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act pnc became a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 

  

the glb act also permits a national bank such as pnc bank to engage through the formation of a “financial subsidiary” in expanded activities including securities underwriting and dealing 

  

in order to qualify to establish or acquire a financial subsidiary a national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates must maintain “well capitalized” capital ratios examination ratings of “1” or “2” on a scale of “1” to “5” and certain other criteria that are incorporated into the definition of “well managed” in the occ’s rules and may not have a less than satisfactory community reinvestment act rating in addition the total assets of all financial subsidiaries of a national bank may not exceed the lesser of 45 of the parent bank’s total assets or 50 billion a national bank that is one of the largest 50 insured banks in the united states such as pnc bank must also have issued debt with certain minimum ratings in addition to calculating its riskbased capital on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis a national bank with one or more financial subsidiaries must also be “well capitalized” after excluding from its equity all equity investments including retained earnings in a financial subsidiary and excluding from its consolidated assets the assets of the financial subsidiary any published financial statement for a national bank with a financial subsidiary must provide risk based capital information both in accordance with gaap and as described above the bank must also have policies and procedures to assess financial subsidiary risks and potential liabilities and protect the bank from such risks and potential liabilities

pursuant to the glb act pnc bank has filed a “financial subsidiary certification” with the occ in accordance with the financial subsidiary provisions blackrock while remaining an operating subsidiary of a national bank may establish financial subsidiaries that engage in a broader range of activities than would be permissible for an operating subsidiary of a national bank blackrock has utilized this authority and established two financial subsidiaries that engage in the activities of providing initial funding to mutual funds and holding certain equity interests permissible for a financial subsidiary 

  

under the glb act and the occ’s proposed regulations if a national bank that has one or more financial subsidiaries or any depository institution affiliate of such national bank subsequently fails to meet the “well capitalized” or “well managed” and related criteria the national bank must enter into an agreement with the occ to correct the condition the occ has the authority to limit the activities of such a national bank if the condition is not corrected within six months or within any additional time granted by the occ the national bank could be required to conform the activities of its financial subsidiaries to activities in which a national bank could engage directly in addition if the bank or any insured depository institution affiliate receives a less than satisfactory community reinvestment act examination rating the national bank would not be permitted to engage in any new activities or to make new investments in reliance upon the financial subsidiary authority

note to table 

  

   

   

we believe that operating margin as reported is an effective indicator of management’s ability to effectively employ the company’s resources fund administration and servicing costs have been excluded from operating margin because these costs are a contractual assetbased expense which can fluctuate based on the discretion of a third party

general 

  

blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of assets under management and are affected by changes in assets under management including market appreciation or depreciation and net subscriptions or redemptions net subscriptions or redemptions represent the sum of new client assets additional fundings from existing clients withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on and changes in the fair value of securities held in client accounts 

  

investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and blackrock’s alternative investment products provide for performance fees in addition to fees based on assets under management performance fees generally are earned when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold and accordingly may increase the volatility of blackrock’s revenue and earnings 

  

blackrock provides a variety of risk management investment analytics and investment system services to insurance companies finance companies pension funds asset managers foundations consultants mutual fund sponsors reits commercial and mortgage banks savings institutions and government agencies these services are provided under the brand name blackrock solutions and include a wide array of risk management services and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients fees earned for blackrock solutions services are based either on predetermined percentages of the market value of assets subject to the services or on fixed monthly or quarterly payments the fees earned on risk management advisory and investment system assignments are recorded as other income 

  

operating expense consists of employee compensation and benefits fund administration and servicing costs general and administration expense and amortization of intangible assets employee compensation and benefits expense reflects salaries deferred and incentive compensation and related benefit costs fund administration and servicing costs reflect payments made to pnc affiliated entities and third parties primarily associated with the administration and servicing of client investments in the blackrock funds and blackrock closedend funds intangible assets at december 31 2003 and 2002 were approximately 1921 million and approximately 1828 million respectively with amortization expense of approximately 09 million 08 million and 105 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively amortization of intangible assets decreased due to the adoption of sfas no 142 in 2002 intangible assets primarily reflect pnc’s acquisition of blackrock financial management lp bfm on february 28 1995 and a management contract acquired in connection with the agreement and plan of merger of core cap inc with anthracite capital inc anthracite

assets under management 

  

assets under management aum increased 365 billion or 13 to 3094 billion at december 31 2003 compared with 2728 billion at december 31 2002 the growth in assets under management was attributable to an increase of 391 billion or 21 in separate accounts partially offset by a decrease of 26 billion or 3 in mutual fund assets 

  

the increase in separate accounts at december 31 2003 as compared with december 31 2002 was the result of net subscriptions of 265 billion and market appreciation of 125 billion net subscriptions in fixed income separate accounts liquiditysecurities lending separate accounts and alternative investment products were 241 billion 35 billion and 15 billion respectively while equity separate accounts experienced net redemptions of 29 billion the rise in fixed income separate accounts was primarily attributable to strong relative investment performance resulting in higher levels of funding from existing clients as well as increased sales to new clients fixed income net subscriptions of 241 billion is net of approximately 39 billion of market rebalancing outflows liquiditysecurities lending separate accounts have increased due to an improvement in equity markets during 2003 resulting in higher levels of cash collateral managed for pfpc worldwide inc a pnc subsidiary the 15 billion increase in alternative investment products stems from 08 billion of net new business in real estate products the 03 billion launch of magnetite v clo limited on september 30 2003 and 03 billion related to the acquisition of a hedge fund of funds manager and the subsequent addition of new fund of fund clients during 2003 the decline in equity separate accounts consisted of net redemptions totaling 32 billion in international equity accounts due to poor relative investment performance partially offset by a 02 billion of net subscriptions in domestic equity assets during 2003 market appreciation of 125 billion in separate accounts was primarily comprised of appreciation in fixed income assets of 97 billion due to current income and changes in interest rates and market appreciation in equity assets of 26 billion 

  

the 26 billion year over year decrease in mutual fund assets reflected net redemptions of 41 billion which was partially offset by 06 billion of market appreciation in the closedend funds driven by declining interest rates and 08 billion of market appreciation in the blackrock funds largely associated with the rise in the equity markets net redemptions of 41 billion primarily consisted of 67 billion in blackrock liquidity fund assets which was partially offset by 25 billion in net new business in the closedend funds the decrease in blackrock liquidity fund assets was the result of lower absolute returns coupled with stable short term interest rates during the first quarter of 2003 as compared to 2002 which resulted in net redemption of 111 billion during the first quarter net redemptions in the blackrock liquidity funds during the three months ended march 31 2003 were partially offset by 44 billion in net subscriptions during the remainder of the year

expense 

  

total expense increased 81 million to 3699 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared with 3618 for the year ended december 31 2002 the change primarily reflects increases in general and administration expense and fund administration and servicing costs paid to third parties of 187 million and 43 million respectively partially offset by decreases in affiliated fund administration and servicing costs and employee compensation and benefits of 134 million and 64 million excluding the impact of increased appreciation of rabbi trust assets respectively 

  

   

the increase in general and administration expense primarily reflects increased marketing and promotional expense of 57 million associated with new closedend fund launches and general business growth 48 million in professional services and other costs incurred or reserved in connection with governmental investigations of the mutual fund industry and the implementation of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities” revised december 2003 “fin 46r” 28 million in increased occupancy costs related to the completion of blackrock’s new headquarters facility in mid2002 18 million in foreign currency expense due to the decline of the us dollar 15 million in market data services and 13 million in insurance premiums the rise in fund administration and servicing costs paid to third parties is primarily attributable to servicing costs related to new closedend fund launches the decline in affiliated fund administration and servicing costs was attributable to 134 million in decreased expense related to redemptions of pncrelated assets during 2003 employee compensation and benefits expense excluding the impact of increased appreciation of rabbi trust assets decreased 64 million or 3 and primarily consisted of a 190 million decrease in direct incentive compensation related to decreased performance fees earned on the company’s fixed income hedge fund and a 22 million reversal of deferred compensation expense that more than offset increases in salaries and benefits of 68 million to support business growth and increased general bonus accruals of 58 million primarily due to operating income growth during the year ended december 31 2003 employee compensation and benefits increased 46 million compared to the year ended december 31 2002 due to increased appreciation of rabbi trust assets related to blackrock deferred compensation plans

management believes that operating margin as adjusted is an effective indicator of its ability to effectively employ the company’s resources appreciation on rabbi trust assets related to the company’s deferred compensation plans has been excluded because investment performance of these assests has a nominal impact on net income investment income and compensation and benefits expense related to these plans increase and decrease in equal amounts except for minor timing differences

net cash flow used in investing activities was 196 million 968 million and 1671 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively capital expenditures in 2003 for property and equipment were 135 million compared to 428 million during the year ended december 31 2002 and reflected the purchase of equipment to support corporate expansion and the growth of blackrock solutions cash paid for acquisitions of 89 million during the year ended december 31 2003 consists of the acquisition of an 80 interest in a hedge fund of funds manager and the settlement of a contingent payment related to the acquisition of an equity hedge fund manager in 2002 net sales of investments were 27 million for the year ended december 31 2003 which primarily reflected a 741 million incremental divestiture of investments in the company’s fixed income mutual funds partially offset by a 632 million net investment in municipal bonds and 71 million in seed investments made in certain new alternative investment products 

  

net cash flow used in financing activities was 1023 million 82 million and 62 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively financing activities primarily represented treasury stock activity and the payment of blackrock’s first two quarterly dividends of 020 per share during the year ended december 31 2003 on february 26 2004 blackrock’s board of directors approved a 25 increase in blackrock’s quarterly dividend to 025 per share under the company’s share repurchase program blackrock acquired approximately 16 million shares at a total cost of 751 million during the year ended december 31 2003 in addition in connection with the blackrock longterm deferred compensation plan blackrock repurchased approximately 157000 shares of class a common stock at a total cost of 68 million from certain employees to facilitate required employee income tax payments during 2003 approximately 75 million received by the company related primarily to the exercise of stock options partially offset these transactions during the year ended december 31 2003 

  

subsequent to december 31 2003 blackrock’s board of directors approved a 2 million share repurchase program the company may make repurchases from time to time as market conditions warrant in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the full discretion of the company’s management the authority to purchase 310000 shares available under preexisting programs terminated with the approval of this program in addition to authorizing the new share repurchase program the board of directors also approved a management stock buyback the management buyback that authorized blackrock to purchase shares owned by senior management through the repurchase program shares repurchased by the company under the management buyback reduced the current 2 million share repurchase authorization eligible participants elected to sell an aggregate of 690575 shares which based on blackrock’s average closing price for the five days ended january 28 2004 approximated 404 million

liquidity and capital resources continued 

  

during the year ended december 31 2003 the company’s free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities 1796 million and 1720 million during the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively less purchases of property and equipment 135 million and 429 million during the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively increased by 370 million to 1661 million as compared to 1291 million during the year ended december 31 2002 the increase in the company’s free cash flow is primarily attributable to significant capital expenditures of 429 million made during the year ended december 31 2002 which reflected construction costs and purchases of equipment for 40 east 52 nd street new york new york the company’s corporate headquarters which was completed in mid2002 compared to 135 million during the current period we believe that free cash flow may be useful to investors as an indicator of the company’s ability to meet working capital requirements 

  

total capital at december 31 2003 and 2002 was 7145 million and 6347 million respectively and was comprised primarily of stockholders’ equity

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

the company leases its primary office space under agreements that expire through 2017 in connection with certain lease agreements the company is responsible for escalation payments 

  

in connection with the management contract acquired on may 15 2000 associated with the agreement and plan of merger of core cap inc with anthracite a blackrock managed reit the company recorded an 80 million liability using an imputed interest rate of 10 the prevailing interest rate on the date of acquisition for the year ended december 31 2003 the related expense was 06 million at december 31 2003 the future commitment under the agreement is 80 million if anthracite’s management contract with blackrock is terminated not renewed or not extended for any reason other than cause anthracite would remit to the company all future payments due under this obligation 

  

in the ordinary course of business blackrock enters into contracts purchase obligations with third parties pursuant to which the third parties provide services to or on behalf of blackrock purchase obligations represent executory contracts which are either noncancelable or cancelable with penalty at december 31 2003 the company’s obligations primarily reflect shareholder servicing arrangements related to client investments in the blackrock closedend funds subadvisory agreements and standard service contracts with third parties for portfolio market data and office services 

  

in many of the contracts blackrock agrees to indemnify the third party service provider under certain circumstances the terms of the indemnity vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability if any cannot be determined 

  

the company has entered into a commitment to invest 77 million in carbon capital inc an alternative investment fund sponsored by blackrock of which 35 million remained unfunded at december 31 2003 

  

summary of commitments 

  

   

on april 30 2003 the company purchased 80 of the outstanding equity interests of an investment manager of a hedge fund of funds for approximately 41 million in cash additionally the company has committed to purchase the remaining equity of the investment manager on march 31 2008 subject to certain acceleration provisions the purchase price of this remaining interest is performancebased and is not subject to a maximum or the continued employment of former employees of the investment manager with the company the company is unable to estimate its potential obligation at this time therefore it is not included in the table above 

  

as previously disclosed blackrock has received subpoenas from the various federal and state governmental and regulatory authorities and various information requests from the securities and exchange commission in connection with industrywide investigations of mutual fund matters blackrock is continuing to cooperate fully in these matters and has incurred or reserved approximately 40 million to cover the currently estimated aggregate costs in connection with these regulatory matters

income tax matters 

  

the company’s new york state income tax returns are under examination for the years ended december 31 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 the primary issues raised by the state taxing authority are whether certain blackrock subsidiaries should have filed in the state and whether blackrock is permitted to be included in a combined tax return filing with pnc management does not expect the results of this examination to adversely affect the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates management considers the following accounting policies critical to an informed review of blackrock’s consolidated financial statements for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f8 

  

investments 

  

readily marketable securities 

  

the accounting method used for the company’s readily marketable securities is dependent upon the company’s ownership level if blackrock does not possess significant influence over the issuer’s operations the securities are classified as trading or available for sale depending on the company’s intent on holding the security if blackrock holds significant influence over the issuer of a readily marketable equity security the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in investments other company management’s conclusion that blackrock holds significant influence over an issuer whose security was previously classified as an available for sale security has a significant impact on the company’s net income due to the related accounting treatment under the equity method the company’s share of the investee’s net income is recorded in investment income loss while unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income or loss component of stockholders’ equity until the securities are sold unrealized losses incurred during the year ended december 31 2003 on readily marketable available for sale securities were approximately 17 million 

  

nonmarketable equity securities 

  

investments other are accounted for using the cost or equity methods of accounting if the company has significant influence over the investee’s operations the equity method of accounting is used and the company’s share of the investee’s net income is recorded as investment income expense for alternative investment products and other income for operating joint ventures if the company does not maintain significant influence over the investee’s operations the cost method of accounting is used under the cost method of accounting investment income is recognized as received or upon the sale of the security therefore company management’s conclusion that blackrock holds significant influence over an issuer has a significant impact on the company’s net income unrealized gains on investments accounted for under the cost method totaled approximately 07 million during the year ended december 31 2003

critical accounting estimates continued 

  

investments continued 

  

impairment of securities 

  

the company’s management periodically assesses impairment on investments to determine if it is other than temporary 

  

several of the company’s available for sale investments represent interests in collateralized debt obligations in which the company acts in the capacity of collateral manager the company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each collateralized debt obligation to determine if an impairment charge is required to be taken through current earnings if the updated estimate of future cash flows taking into account both timing and amount is less than the last revised estimate an impairment is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value 

  

in evaluating impairments on all other available for sale and other securities the company considers the length of time and the extent to which the security’s market value if determinable has been less than its cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the security’s issuer and the company’s intended holding period for the security 

  

blackrock long term retention and incentive plan ltip 

  

the ltip permits the grant of up to 240 million in deferred compensation awards the “ltip awards” subject to the achievement of certain performance hurdles by the company no later than march 2007 the compensation committee of the company’s board of directors may vest a portion of the ltip awards in its sole discretion if the company achieves certain alternative performance hurdles during the vesting period for a more detailed discussion of the ltip refer to note 10 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

there will be no expense recognition associated with the ltip awards unless vesting occurs or a partial vesting determination is considered probable and estimable the compensation and audit committees have determined based on current conditions that the probability of indicating any partial vesting prior to the opportunity for commencement of full vesting of the program at the conclusion of the first quarter of 2005 is unlikely the ltip was constructed such that the expected increase in value to stockholders necessary to fully vest the program had to result from continued growth in the company’s earnings rather than from changes in the financial markets as such the compensation committee established a minimum performance period through december 31 2004 under which no vesting of the program would occur at such time the compensation and audit committees will evaluate the likelihood that the company will complete the program term with alternative vesting criteria performance in excess of ltip requirements the company will accrue expense for this contingency accordingly

critical accounting estimates continued 

  

income taxes 

  

the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 

  

property and equipment 

  

property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation generally is provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment accelerated methods are used for income tax purposes leasehold improvements are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives or lease terms whichever is shorter a change in an asset class’s estimated useful life by management would have a significant impact on the company’s depreciation expense approximately 204 million for the year ended december 31 2003 due to the concentration of the company’s property and equipment in relatively shortlived assets useful lives of three to five years a summary of the estimated useful lives used by asset class is included in note 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

recent accounting developments 

  

in december 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 46 revised 2003 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46r” fin 46r addresses the application of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” to variable interest entities “vie” and generally would require that the assets liabilities and results of operations of a vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in it the interpretation provides a framework for determining whether an entity should be evaluated for consolidation based on voting interests or significant financial support provided to the entity “variable interests” 

  

an entity is classified as a vie if total equity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity investors lack the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity’s activities through voting rights absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur or receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur once an entity is determined to be a vie its assets liabilities and results of operations should be consolidated with those of its primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a vie is the entity that either will absorb a majority of the vie’s expected losses or has the right to receive a majority of the vie’s expected residual returns the expected losses and residual returns of a vie include expected variability in its net income or loss fees to decision makers and fees to guarantors of substantially all vie assets or liabilities and are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting concept no 7 “using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements” 

  

a public enterprise with a variable interest in a vie must apply fin 46r to that vie no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march 15 2004 with the exception of special purpose entities “spes” as defined a public enterprise with a variable interest in an spe that has been deemed a vie must apply fin 46r to that vie no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after december 15 2003 additionally if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a vie when the guidance becomes effective there are several disclosure requirements effective for all financial statements issued after january 31 2003 the company has included the required disclosures for vies in which it has significant involvement in the notes to the consolidated financial statements which begin on page f3 of this filing 

  

 47  

   

recent accounting developments continued 

  

pursuant to the conceptual framework set forth in fin 46r the company’s management has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of any spes that have been deemed vies therefore the adoption of fin 46r has not had a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

under previous guidance the company’s management determined that the company was the primary beneficiary of six collateralized debt obligations cdo and consolidated the results of operations financial position and cash flow for these entities during the three months ended september 30 2003 the cdos were subsequently deconsolidated under fin 46r a reconciliation of blackrock’s adjusted condensed consolidated statements of financial condition and operations as of and for the three months ended september 30 2003 to the company’s quarterly report on form 10q for the three months ended september 30 2003 is included in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 132 revised december 2003 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 and 106” “sfas no 132r” this statement requires additional disclosures about the assets obligations cash flows and net period benefit costs of a company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans but does not change the measurement or recognition requirements set forth in preexisting guidance the company participates in pnc’s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans and does not maintain its own plans no separate financial obligation data for the company is available with respect to such plans therefore the adoption of sfas no 132r which is effective for all fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” sfas no 150 addresses the standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 150 became effective for all instruments issued after may 1 2003 and is required to be applied to all financial instruments as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june 15 2003 the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 149 amended and clarified financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

interest rates 

  

the value of assets under management is affected by changes in interest rates since blackrock derives the majority of its revenues from investment advisory fees based on the value of assets under management blackrock’s revenues may be adversely affected by changing interest rates in a period of rapidly rising interest rates blackrock’s assets under management would likely be negatively affected by reduced asset values and increased redemptions 

  

inflation 

  

the majority of blackrock’s revenues are based on the value of assets under management there is no predictable relationship between the rate of inflation and the value of assets under management by blackrock except as inflation may affect interest rates blackrock does not believe inflation will significantly affect its compensation costs as they are substantially variable in nature however the rate of inflation may affect blackrock’s expenses such as information technology and occupancy costs to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets it may adversely affect blackrock’s results of operations by reducing blackrock’s assets under management revenues or otherwise

business continued 

tableend our ability to generate growth in assets under management is the primary factor driving increases in revenue and earnings and ultimately stockholder value our strategies to deliver growth in assets under management begin with our focus on achieving client investment performance objectives and providing “best in class” client service accordingly we dedicate significant resources to attracting and retaining talented professionals the most critical component to maintaining a dynamic growthoriented firm and to the ongoing enhancement of our investment technology and operating capabilities 

blackrock’s business results largely reflect our position as a leading provider of fixed income and liquidity asset management services to institutional clients of the 273 billion of assets we managed at december 31 2002 approximately 244 billion or 89 were from institutional clients with the remaining 29 billion reflecting individual client investments in our openend and closedend mutual fund families while we direct substantial resources to our fixed income and liquidity products we also incur significant expense and have made additional investments over the last two years to establish a quality menu of equity products which can be marketed to both institutional and individual investors additionally we have enjoyed early success to the introduction of blackrock solutions products in 2000 achieving sales to date in excess of our initial expectations for 2002 blackrock solutions revenue growth exceeded 50 

we have generated substantial increases in assets under management which has resulted in strong revenue and earnings growth since our formation in 1998 our financial condition has also been enhanced with the retirement of all longterm debt in 1999 and sizable increases in corporate liquidity cash and investments and stockholders’ equity

 distribution 

blackrock provides investment and risk management services to a diverse institutional and individual client base client assets are managed in a broad spectrum of fixed income liquidity equity and alternative investment separate accounts and mutual funds in 2002 institutional assets increased by 18 to 244 billion while individual assets declined by 11 to 29 billion the following table provides an analysis of assets under management by investor type classified by amounts reported as separate accounts and mutual funds all international client assets are classified as institutional with high net worth client balances included in both the institutional and individual categories 

assets under management by investor 

 blackrock’s goal is to serve our clients with competitive investment products effective risk management solutions and the highest quality service a key measure of success net new business totaled 35 billion in 2002 across all distribution channels other than pncrelated accounts which experienced over 10 billion of net redemptions we also made a number of investments during the year to expand our ability to serve middle market institutions high net worth investors and private clients at the end of the year we consolidated all of these efforts on a unified marketing and client service platform which we believe will enable us to better leverage our relationships and crosssell blackrock’s products and services 

our largest client base continues to be domestic taxexempt institutions including public and private pension plans foundations and endowments at yearend 2002 these investors represented 30 of our total assets under management with 81 billion managed for 270 separate account clients our new business efforts yielded 74 billion of inflows during the year which included the impact of approximately 77 billion of outflows resulting from client rebalancing of bondequity allocations we have benefited from manager consolidation by pension plans and we continue to see tremendous opportunity to broaden our existing relationships and to attract new clients as our product line and distribution capabilities expand

 distribution continued 

domestic institutional liquidity assets totaled 68 billion at december 31 2002 or 25 of total assets under management during the year 61 billion of net inflows in our us institutional money market funds were offset by 59 billion of net outflows in securities lending and other liquidity separate accounts a variety of institutions use our liquidity products including bank trusts corporations and municipalities and their investment activity is supported by a dedicated client service team and selected software applications 

during 2002 assets managed for domestic taxable institutions grew to 50 billion or 18 of total assets under management at yearend growth came principally from insurance clients where we capitalized on the changing industry landscape and added 82 billion in net new business by offering comprehensive services including portfolio management strategic advice assetliability management portfolio hedging and investment accounting services we have established blackrock as one of the largest independent managers of insurance assets in the united states in early 2003 we added a senior portfolio manager with extensive industry experience enhancing our ability to serve insurers and banks as they expand their investment outsourcing activity 

blackrock continued to expand its global presence in 2002 increasing assets managed for international clients to 45 billion or 16 of total assets under management at yearend approximately 1 billion of these assets were managed for high net worth investors during the year we raised 30 billion from offshore insurance companies and 74 billion from other institutional and high net worth investors in europe asia and the middle east through our alliances with nomura in japan and westpac in australia we believe blackrock is poised to benefit from increased global focus on riskadjusted returns and risk management capabilities particularly as our global name recognition improves and additional local distribution capabilities are established 

a large percentage of our separate account assets are shared relationships with institutional consultants who advise our clients on actuarial analysis asset allocation manager search selection and monitoring to enhance coordination and comprehensive service we establish threeway partnerships with our clients and their consultants sharing insights about the markets and industry trends and providing regular updates on blackrock’s business and investment performance these efforts which are supported by a dedicated consultant marketing group have contributed substantially to our new business efforts helping us achieve a 29 compound annual growth rate in separate account assets under management over the past five years 

individual investors are served through two distinct efforts that collectively represented 29 billion or 11 of total assets under management at yearend 2002 our private client group focuses on wholesale distribution of blackrock’s mutual funds and managed accounts through national and regional broker dealers financial planners and pnc our wealth management group offers traditional and alternative investments directly to high net worth investors and family offices new business efforts in 2002 resulted in 29 billion in net inflows in new closedend funds and separate accounts for high net worth investors which were more than offset by a 25 decline in openend mutual fund assets resulting principally from equity market declines and 50 billion of outflows from pncrelated accounts we expect that the addition of senior professionals in both of these efforts will help us increase assets managed for individual investors over time

 risks 

as a leading investment management firm risk is an inherent part of blackrock’s business global markets by their nature are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks as previously discussed in this report risk management is considered to be of paramount importance to blackrock’s daytoday operations consequently blackrock devotes significant resources across all its operations to the measurement management and analysis of risk including investments in personnel and technology

the foregoing risks are not exhaustive and new risks may emerge which affect blackrock’s businesses it is impossible for management to predict such risks and therefore forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future results 

competition 

blackrock competes with investment management firms mutual fund complexes insurance companies banks brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to or alternatives to those offered by blackrock in order to grow our business blackrock must be able to compete effectively for assets under management key competitive factors include investment performance track records investment style and discipline client service and brand name recognition we have historically competed principally on the basis of our longterm investment performance track record our investment process our risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of our client service over the past seven years we have succeeded in growing aggregate assets under management and we believe that we will continue to be able to do so by focusing on strong investment performance and client service and by developing new products and new distribution capabilities many of our competitors however have greater financial or marketing resources and better brand name recognition than blackrock these factors may place blackrock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain our existing assets and attract new business will be successful 

employees 

at december 31 2002 blackrock had 909 fulltime employees including 186 professionals in the portfolio management group 244 professionals in risk management and analytics 217 professionals in the separate account and funds marketing and client service areas and 262 professionals in administrative and support departments 

regulation 

virtually all aspects of blackrock’s business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations some of which are summarized below these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients stockholders of registered investment companies pnc’s bank subsidiaries and bank customers of pnc bank under these laws and regulations agencies that regulate investment advisers and banks and their subsidiaries such as blackrock and its subsidiaries have broad administrative powers including the power to limit restrict or prohibit the regulated entity from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time revocation of investment adviser and other registrations censures and fines 

blackrock’s subsidiaries are subject to regulation primarily at the federal level by the sec the department of labor the occ the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb the commodity futures trading commission cftc and other regulatory bodies 

the investment advisers act of 1940 as amended imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as blackrock including recordkeeping requirements operational requirements marketing requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities the investment company act of 1940 as amended imposes similar obligations as well as detailed operational requirements on investment advisers such as blackrock to registered investment companies and other managed accounts the sec is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the investment advisers act and the investment company act ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations

 regulation continued 

blackrock’s subsidiaries also are subject to erisa and to regulations promulgated thereunder insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under erisa with respect to benefit plan clients erisa and applicable provisions of the internal revenue code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under erisa prohibit certain transactions involving erisa plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions 

one of blackrock’s subsidiaries is registered as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor with the cftc and the national futures association nfa the cftc and nfa administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments in which blackrock clients may invest another subsidiary is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer and is a member of the national association of securities dealers nasd although this entity’s nasd membership agreement limits its permitted activities to the sale of investment company securities and annuities and certain private placement and financial consulting activities it is subject to the customer dealing reporting and other requirements of the nasd as well as the net capital and other requirements of the sec 

blackrock’s international operations are also subject to the laws of nonus jurisdictions and nonus regulatory agencies or bodies as blackrock has expanded its international business various of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems comparable to those affecting its operations in the us blackrock’s international subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination by these regulatory agencies and have developed comprehensive compliance systems in order to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements the failure of blackrock’s internal operations to comply with the applicable regulatory frameworks could have a material adverse effect on blackrock 

pnc is a bank holding company and as discussed below is also a “financial holding company” regulated by the frb pnc bank the indirect parent of blackrock is a national bank subsidiary of pnc as an operating subsidiary of pnc bank blackrock is subject to most banking laws regulations and orders that are applicable to pnc bank and therefore to the supervision regulation and examination of the occ as well as the sec the occ and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic also have broad enforcement authority over pnc bank and its subsidiaries including the power to prohibit pnc bank or any subsidiary from engaging in any activity that in the occ’s opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business to appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver of pnc bank if any of a number of conditions are met and to impose substantial fines and other penalties supervision and regulation of pnc bank and its subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors the deposit insurance funds of the fdic and the banking system as a whole not for the protection of stockholders or creditors of national banks or their subsidiaries the frb has regulatory and supervisory authority with respect to pnc’s nonus activities and investments including nonus activities and investments of blackrock as well as with respect to its nonbank subsidiaries 

because blackrock is a subsidiary of pnc a regulated financial services firm pnc’s relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of our business the frb occ sec and other domestic and foreign regulators have broad enforcement powers and powers to approve deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices of pnc or its subsidiaries to conduct new activities acquire or divest businesses or assets or reconfigure existing operations in addition pnc and its bank subsidiaries are subject to examination by various regulators which results in examination reports and ratings which are not publicly available that can impact the conduct and growth of our businesses these examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations but also capital levels asset quality and risk management ability and performance earnings liabilities and various other factors an examination downgrade by any of the federal bank regulators of pnc or its subsidiaries potentially can result in the imposition of limitations on certain of our activities and on our growth 

because blackrock is a consolidated subsidiary of pnc bank federal restrictions on the payment of dividends by pnc bank might be applied to blackrock under federal law occ approval is needed before pnc bank may pay dividends in any year in which the total of all dividends paid would exceed the total of pnc bank’s net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits from the prior two years pnc bank also may not pay dividends exceeding its capital surplus

 regulation continued 

as an operating subsidiary of a national bank blackrock may not conduct new activities establish a subsidiary or acquire the stock or assets of another company unless it provides notice to andor obtains the approval of the occ or with respect to most nonus activities or investments the frb the occ will generally approve only those activities and investments that are legally permissible for a national bank and consistent with prudent banking principles and regulatory policy the frb will approve only those activities that are usual in connection with the transaction of the business of banking or other financial operations outside of the united states investment management firms with which blackrock competes commonly invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which they provide services pursuant to occ authorization blackrock may invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory administrative or other services to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations including applicable banking laws blackrock’s current domestic and overseas activities are with the limited exception of the activities of blackrock’s financial subsidiaries discussed below permissible for a national bank 

pursuant to the grammleachbliley act the glb act which generally became effective on march 11 2000 a qualifying bank holding company may become a financial holding company and engage in a broad range of financial activities a bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is “well capitalized” is “well managed” and has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act pnc became a financial holding company as of march 13 2000 

the glb act also permits a national bank such as pnc bank to engage through the formation of a “financial subsidiary” in expanded activities including securities underwriting and dealing 

in order to qualify to establish or acquire a financial subsidiary a national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates must maintain “well capitalized” capital ratios examination ratings of “1” or “2” on a scale of “1” to “5” and certain other criteria that are incorporated into the definition of “well managed” in the occ’s rules and may not have a less than satisfactory community reinvestment act rating in addition the total assets of all financial subsidiaries of a national bank may not exceed the lesser of 45 of the parent bank’s total assets or 50 billion a national bank that is one of the largest 50 insured banks in the united states such as pnc bank must also have issued debt with certain minimum ratings in addition to calculating its riskbased capital on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis a national bank with one or more financial subsidiaries must also be “well capitalized” after excluding from its equity all equity investments including retained earnings in a financial subsidiary and excluding from its consolidated assets the assets of the financial subsidiary any published financial statement for a national bank with a financial subsidiary must provide riskbased capital information both in accordance with gaap and as described above the bank must also have policies and procedures to assess financial subsidiary risks and potential liabilities and protect the bank from such risks and potential liabilities 

pursuant to the glb act pnc bank has filed a “financial subsidiary certification” with the occ in accordance with the financial subsidiary provisions blackrock while remaining an operating subsidiary of a national bank may establish financial subsidiaries that engage in a broader range of activities than would be permissible for an operating subsidiary of a national bank blackrock has utilized this authority and established two financial subsidiaries that engage in the activities of providing initial funding to mutual funds and holding certain equity interests permissible for a financial subsidiary 

under the glb act and the occ’s proposed regulations if a national bank that has one or more financial subsidiaries or any depository institution affiliate of such national bank subsequently fails to meet the “well capitalized” or “well managed” and related criteria the national bank must enter into an agreement with the occ to correct the condition the occ has the authority to limit the activities of such a national bank if the condition is not corrected within six months or within any additional time granted by the occ the national bank could be required to conform the activities of its financial subsidiaries to activities in which a national bank could engage directly in addition if the bank or any insured depository institution affiliate receives a less than satisfactory community reinvestment act examination rating the national bank would not be permitted to engage in any new activities or to make new investments in reliance upon the financial subsidiary authority

 regulation continued 

the frb is the “umbrella” supervisor for financial holding companies in addition the financial holding company’s operating entities such as its subsidiary brokerdealers investment managers investment companies banks and other regulated institutions are also subject to the jurisdiction of various state and federal “functional” regulators 

in july 2002 pnc announced that it had entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve bank of cleveland federal reserve and that its principal subsidiary pnc bank had entered into a written agreement with the occ these agreements address such issues as risk management and financial controls pnc and pnc bank also entered into agreements with the federal reserve and the occ respectively requiring pnc and pnc bank to provide a plan for pnc bank to meet the “well capitalized” and “well managed” criteria within a 180day period 

as of december 19 2002 the federal reserve and the occ notified pnc and pnc bank respectively that pnc bank now met both the “well capitalized” and “well managed” criteria this removed the limitations placed in july 2002 on pnc engaging in new activities or making new investments and on pnc bank’s financial subsidiary activities however the written agreements remain in place and pnc and pnc bank including the operating subsidiaries of pnc bank such as blackrock respectively in certain circumstances must seek approval from the federal reserve or the occ respectively before making acquisitions or engaging in new activities pnc and pnc bank believe that they have made substantial progress to date in addressing the various requirements set forth in the written agreements there can be no assurance however as to the precise timing for determining that all required corrective actions have been taken to the appropriate satisfaction of the federal reserve and the occ 

under federal law pnc bank and its subsidiaries including blackrock generally may not engage in transactions with pnc or its nonbank subsidiaries except on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same as those prevailing for comparable transactions involving nonaffiliated companies or in the absence of comparable transactions that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies in addition certain transactions including loans and other extensions of credit guarantees investments and asset purchases between pnc bank and its subsidiaries including blackrock on the one hand and pnc and its nonbank subsidiaries on the other hand are limited to 10 of pnc bank’s capital and loan loss reserve allowance for transactions with a single company and to 20 of pnc bank’s capital and loan loss reserve allowance for aggregate transactions with pnc and all its nonbank subsidiaries and other affiliates in certain circumstances federal regulatory authorities may impose more restrictive limitations such extensions of credit with limited exceptions must be fully collateralized these affiliate transaction restrictions also apply in some cases to loans or other transactions between pnc bank or blackrock on the one hand and financial subsidiaries of pnc bank or blackrock or investment funds advised by blackrock on the other 

the fdic could be appointed as conservator or receiver of pnc bank if the bank were to become insolvent or if other conditions or events were to occur as conservator or receiver the fdic could exercise all rights of pnc bank as a stockholder of blackrock the fdic would also have the authority to repudiate contracts by pnc bank including servicing or other contracts with blackrock at any time within 180 days of its appointment as conservator or receiver and would be obligated to pay blackrock only “actual direct compensatory damages” not including damages for lost profits or opportunity as of the date of conservatorship or receivership as a result of such repudiation the fdic could also disregard without paying damages any contract that tended to diminish or defeat the fdic’s interest in any pnc bank asset if the contract were not

 regulation continued 

 in addition the fdic could obtain a stay of up to 90 days of any judicial action or proceeding involving pnc bank and could require blackrock to exhaust its remedies under fdic claims procedures before pursuing any available judicial remedy 

pnc’s bank subsidiaries are subject to “crossguarantee” provisions under federal law which provide that if one of these banks or thrifts fails or requires fdic assistance the fdic may assess a “commonly controlled” bank or thrift such as pnc bank for the estimated losses suffered by the fdic the fdic’s claim is superior to the claims of affiliates such as blackrock and of stockholders of the banks at december 31 2002 both of pnc’s bank subsidiaries exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well capitalized” under statutory and regulatory standards 

blackrock is subject to the usa patriot act of 2001 which contains the international money laundering abatement and antiterrorist financing act of 2001 that act contains antimoney laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain financial institutions the act requires us financial institutions to adopt new policies and procedures to combat money laundering and grants the secretary of the treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions’ operations blackrock has established policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the act and the related regulations 

pnc currently holds its ownership interest in blackrock through a subsidiary of pnc bank as such blackrock currently is not subject to regulation under the nonbanking provisions of the bank holding company act if pnc were instead to hold its ownership interest in blackrock at the holding company level blackrock would no longer be subject to occ supervision and regulation as a subsidiary of a national bank but would instead become subject to frb supervision and regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of a financial holding company a nonbank subsidiary of a financial holding company may engage in insurance underwriting insurance investment real estate investment or development and merchant banking activities as well as the activities permissible for a financial subsidiary of a national bank 

additional legislation changes in rules promulgated by the sec other federal and state regulatory authorities and selfregulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of blackrock and its subsidiaries the profitability of blackrock and it subsidiaries could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities in general including changes to the laws governing taxation antitrust regulation and electronic commerce 

the rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical accordingly the above discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be complete

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation– transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123” sfas no 148 amends sfas no 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial requirements about the method of accounting for stockbased compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results as discussed previously in adopting this statement the company has elected to apply the recognition provisions of sfas no 123 to all employee awards granted modified or settled after january 1 2003 when fully implemented the impact to the company’s financial statements assuming recurring stock option grants of similar size and value to those made during 1999 and 2000 is expected to result in an annual reduction of approximately 3 to diluted earnings per share 

d consolidation 

in january 2003 the fasb issued fin no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin no 46 addresses the application of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” to variable interest entities vie and generally would require that the assets liabilities and results of operations of a vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in it the interpretation provides a framework for determining whether an entity should be evaluated for consolidation based on voting interests or significant financial support provided to the entity variable interests 

an entity is classified as a vie if total equity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity investors lack the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity’s activities through voting rights absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur or receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur once an entity is determined to be a vie its assets liabilities and results of operations should be consolidated with those of its primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a vie is the entity which either will absorb a majority of the vie’s expected losses or has the right to receive a majority of the vie’s expected residual returns the expected losses and residual returns of a vie include expected variability in its net income or loss fees to decision makers and fees to guarantors of substantially all vie assets or liabilities and are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting concept no 7 “using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements”

 recent accounting developments continued 

d consolidation continued 

a public enterprise with a variable interest in a vie created before january 31 2003 must apply fin no 46 to that vie as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june 15 2003 additionally if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a vie when the guidance becomes effective there are several disclosure requirements effective for all financial statements issued after january 31 2003 

pursuant to the conceptual framework set forth in fin no 46 the company’s management has concluded that the consolidation of the assets liabilities and results of operations of several sponsored investment vehicles which have been deemed vies in its consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended september 30 2003 is reasonably possible blackrock’s maximum potential loss related to these vies is limited to the amount of its respective equity ownership in each of these investment vehicles and consequently has no risk of loss with respect to the debt of these investment vehicles additionally the company has neither guaranteed nor is contractually liable for any of the vies’ obligations pertinent information as of december 31 2002 relating to these vies is as follows 

 as currently organized the following entities would be considered vies under fin 46 however management has identified and intends to implement certain changes to the equity ownership andor control structure of these entities that management believes would remove them from the scope of fin 46 and as a result these entities would not be required to be consolidated in the third quarter of 2003 

 management will continue to assess this interpretation’s final impact on its consolidated financial statements in addition the fasb is discussing implementation guidelines associated with fin no 46 which could change our current assessment of its impact therefore additional entities may be subject to consolidation upon blackrock’s final adoption of fin no 46
